In the name of fear and political exploitation of anti-gun rhetoric, a citizens Second Amendment rights have been ripped away from him by the government. The new red flag law, which has taken hold in other states already, allows the courts and law enforcement to take away guns from individuals they deem are dangerous and theyve just begun the confiscation.

2035,Gubernatorial Candidate Travis Allen: Arrest Jerry Brown For Defying Federal Immigration Laws,"This is the fifth installment in a series of Capital Public Radio interviews with the prominent candidates for California governor. You can find all the interviews here. The Trump administration has suggested it may try to prosecute elected officials who help enact or enforce state or local immigration measures that conflict with federal law. Travis Allen thinks the feds should arrest the man he hopes to replace as California governor. The Republican assemblyman from Orange County, one of three GOP candidates to succeed termed-out Gov. Jerry Brown, says the Democrat should face consequences for signing a bill last year that limits state and local law enforcement agencies from cooperating with federal immigration authorities. Absolutely, absolutely, Allen said when asked whether Brown should be arrested in a recent interview with Capital Public Radio. This whole sanctuary state  it's an illegal concept, and it is very clear that immigration is the specific duty of the federal government. Jerry Brown is breaking federal law by instituting this illegal sanctuary state, Allen said. There is a federal immigration law and it must be followed by California. That drew a sharp response from Browns office. Given this individuals day job, one would expect him to be a bit more familiar with the law and how it works, press secretary Evan Westrup wrote in an email. Hopefully hell consider doing a little homework  and thinking  before saying such an absurd thing aloud next time. The measure, Senate Bill 54, easily passed the Legislature last fall after Brown and the bills author, Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Len, negotiated amendments that addressed some concerns among law enforcement groups. Westrup also pointed to a passage in Browns SB 54 signing message: It is important to note what the bill does not do, Brown wrote last fall. This bill does not prevent or prohibit Immigration and Customs Enforcement or the Department of Homeland Security from doing their own work in any way. They are free to use their own considerable resources to enforce federal immigration law in California. After his interview was broadcast and this article was published, the assemblyman reached out to say he realized his answer needed clarification. To be more precise, the Justice Department should arrest Jerry Brown if he takes any action to enforce SB 54 that interferes with Federal Immigration authorities doing their constitutional duty, Allen wrote in an email. A good example is [California Attorney General] Xavier Becerra threatening California employers if they cooperate with [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]. Still, Allen is convinced California voters are on his side of the argument. He says the new law is sheltering people in this state who are here illegally and committing crimes while they are here with taxpayer dollars. If elected governor, hes pledged to reverse the sanctuary state law in his first 100 days in office by calling a special election and placing a ballot initiative before voters. Allen is quick to throw punches at the governor on issues well beyond immigration. He said Brown lied by signing a transportation funding bill last year that included fuel tax and vehicle fee increases after promising no new taxes without voter approval during the 2010 gubernatorial campaign. And, referring to several side deals reached to ensure the gas tax bills passage by funding transportation projects in four lawmakers districts, he said Brown was able to bribe four legislators a billion dollars. Asked to name something the governor has done right, Allen declared Browns governorship a legacy of failures. He pointed to the embattled Delta tunnels and high-speed rail projects. Jerry Brown is a lot of talk, and he always has been a lot of talk, he said. A Tea Party Stalwart, But Not An Immediate Trump Supporter Allen is in his sixth year in the Assembly, representing an Orange County district that includes his hometown of Huntington Beach. Hes run an investment advising business since 2001, but grew frustrated watching clients, family and friends move out of California because of the states high taxes and cost of living. So he decided to run for office. I dont think we should have career politicians in California, he said. I think our politicians should be forced to live in the real world and pay real taxes and live under all those crazy laws that they are putting out there. Since his election in 2012, Allen has carved out a voting record and speaking style of an unabashed conservative, the Tea Party, and, he says, President Donald Trump. But he was not an immediate Trump supporter in the 2016 presidential campaign. He first backed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (I thought he had a great chance against Hillary Clinton), then Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (I like the fact that Ted was not afraid to take on the entire establishment). But Allen rallied behind Trump as soon as he became the presumptive GOP nominee, writing an op-ed in May 2016 headlined Its time for Republicans to unify behind Trump. For anyone who believes in common sense and economic prosperity and the Republican values, Allen said in our interview, it was very clear there was only one choice: You're either going to vote for Donald Trump, or anything else you do will support Hillary Clinton. In contrast, Allen noted, one of his rival GOP gubernatorial candidates, San Diego businessman John Cox, voted for libertarian Gary Johnson. I'm the only person in the governor's race, up until just lately, that actually openly supported the president, Allen said. (Cox recently told Capital Public Radio that his vote was a mistake, and that he now backs President Trump.) The other Republican in the governors race, former Sacramento-area Rep. Doug Ose, endorsed Trump even earlier than Allen did and played a leading role in the presidents California campaign. Allen has nothing but praise for Trumps record as president, and vows to bring the same leadership style to California. We need somebody that is not afraid of taking on the establishment on either side, to actually implement policies that are for the best of our state, he said. And I have to tell ya, this is exactly what I think our president's done for our country. Allen voiced support for the federal tax overhaul that Trump and congressional Republicans passed late last year. The new law caps the state and local income and property tax deduction at $10,000, which is expected to increase federal taxes owed by wealthy Californians. In extra-high tax states like California, taking away that state and local deduction against federal taxes  it's gonna hurt some people, and that's very true, Allen said. But on balance, the benefit of the federal tax reform is going to be massive for all the states, including California. He rejected a bill by De Len to deduct state income taxes as charitable contributions. The real answer is not some fancy trick proposed by the Sacramento Democrats, Allen said, calling instead for lowering state income tax rates. When you lower taxes across the board in California, you will unleash an economic engine the likes of which the state has not seen since the Gold Rush. Allens first challenge is to finish in the top two, out of the seven current gubernatorial candidates, in the June primary to advance to the November general election. Three reputable polls released in recent months show him ranging from third place to fifth, no closer than six points to second place. To catch up, hell need to rely on his conservative base to turn out voters; his latest fundraising report filed Wednesday shows his campaign is under water: Allen raised nearly $450,000 last year but ended 2017 with $135,535 cash on hand and $342,850 in debt. Thats well behind Cox, who has contributed several million dollars of his own money. (Ose has just started raising money in the last couple of weeks.) Its possible two Democrats will advance to the runoff. But Allen believes he will make it, along with former San Francisco mayor and current Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, whos led in polls throughout the campaign. If so, Allen is convinced hell have a good shot at winning it all. I think the labels are gonna be very clear, he said. Gavin Newsom is the Bay Area progressive that's to the left of [Vermont Sen.] Bernie Sanders, and Travis Allen is the common-sense Californian that just wants California to once again be the greatest state in the nation. Editor's Note: This article has been updated to add a clarification from Asm. Allen about the circumstances under which he thinks Gov. Brown should be arrested for violating federal immigration law.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2018/feb/07/travis-allen/travis-allen-repeats-false-claim-californians-over/,Politics,Polifact
3015,Cox Pins Gubernatorial Campaign On Neighborhood Legislature Initiative,"San Diego businessman and Republican gubernatorial candidate John Cox at the California GOP Convention in Anaheim, Calif., on Saturday, Oct. 21, 2017. This is the third installment in a series of Capital Public Radio interviews with the prominent candidates for California governor. You can find all the interviews here. John Cox says the only way to get money out of California politics is to multiply the number of state lawmakers by 100. Hes dead serious. So serious, in fact, that the San Diego businessman has just spent $2.5 million of his own money to gather more than 800,000 voter signatures to qualify his Neighborhood Legislature initiative for the November 2018 ballot  a ballot he hopes to be on too, as a candidate for California governor. Cox turned his initiative signatures in to county elections officials last week, triggering the signature verification process that will determine whether his measure will go before voters next fall. As long as the districts and the campaigns are driven by media and television and radio, theyre gonna be expensive. And the people who are elected are going to have to dance to the tune of the people who give the money, Cox told Capital Public Radio in an interview at the California Republican Party convention in Anaheim last month. So the only solution that I think Ive found that would really open up the process and get rid of the power of money is to make the money unnecessary, he says, and thats this idea of a Neighborhood Legislature. Under Coxs ballot proposal, the current 40 Senate and 80 Assembly districts would be split up into micro-districts of 10,000 and 5,000 constituents respectively. Currently, each senator represents more than 930,000 constituents and every assembly member more than 465,000. Youre not gonna need to raise money, Cox says. Youre gonna basically almost know everybody in your district. And that way, the funders lose power. Because Californias current population is approximately 39 million, the initiative would initially create roughly 3,900 neighborhood senators and 7,800 neighborhood assembly members. But only 120 of those neighborhood representatives would head to the state Capitol. According to an analysis of the initiative from Californias nonpartisan Legislative Analysts Office: Beginning in 2022 and by a majority vote the (1) elected Senators in a Senate district would select one representative to serve on the Senate Working Committee and (2) elected Assembly Members in an Assembly district would select one representative to serve on the Assembly Working Committee. Ninety-nine percent of those people stay home, Cox says. And the 12,000 people that are in the neighborhoods go about their life and keep tabs on the people in Sacramento. The 40 senators and 120 assembly members who make up the working committees would write, amend and approve bills. But other than urgency measures, no bill could advance to the governors desk without the approval of the full Neighborhood Senate and Neighborhood Assembly. Cox hopes his Neighborhood Legislature initiative will be a springboard for his gubernatorial campaign. Although he isnt well-known, hes the top Republican in recent polls  which also suggest he has a shot at finishing in the top two in Californias open primary system and advancing to the November election. He describes himself as a conservative fed up with Californias shift to the left. Were a laughingstock, he says of the states business climate. And Im just disgusted with the political class in Sacramento that keeps making life more expensive. This is not a functioning state at the present time, he adds. Were careening towards a disaster. And I dont want to see that happen. Cox acknowledges he voted for libertarian Gary Johnson in the 2016 presidential race  but after observing Donald Trumps opening months, I will say, today, sitting here today, that it was a mistake. So far, President Trump has come through on reducing regulation, reducing the size of government, he says. I am very, very supportive of the things hes done. And he plays up his record as a businessman on the campaign trail. Its the politicians that have messed things up at the state Capitol, he says. And Im running against five politicians.""",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2017/nov/16/john-cox/does-california-have-highest-electricity-bills-nat/,Politics,Polifact
3116,Eastin: Jerry Brown Has Really Hurt California Schools,"This is the second installment in a series of Capital Public Radio interviews with the prominent candidates for California governor. You can find all the interviews here. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Delaine Eastin is accusing termed-out Gov. Jerry Brown of tepid and timid leadership  especially on schools. He has really hurt education in this state, she told Capital Public Radio in an interview earlier this month. He hasnt been for universal preschool. He hasnt been for mandatory kindergarten. He hasnt been for reducing the cost to go to college and university. And so Jerrys marks are not high in my book when it comes to education. Eastin, a former Assemblywoman and State Superintendent of Public Instruction, is one of four prominent Democrats running to replace Brown next year. And while she praises some parts of the governors record  such as his fiscal policy and the deal he reached to extend Californias cap-and-trade greenhouse gas emissions reduction program  her assessment of Browns education policies echoes her broader critique of the states direction overall. Californias still the biggest state in the union  the sixth largest economy in the world  and yet, were doing tepid, timid, small things instead of really dreaming big dreams and doing the right things by kids, adults and seniors, she says. Eastin isnt the best-known Democrat running for governor. She hasnt held elected office in nearly 15 years, and she polls at the bottom of the pack. But shes hoping her campaign will catch fire with her laser-like focus on education. She supports universal preschool, mandatory kindergarten and  with California ranking by one measurement 41st of the 50 states in per-pupil spending  a much larger investment in public education. Asked how to pay for her proposals, Eastin says its time to consider changing how property taxes are assessed on commercial properties under Proposition 13. Right now, were wringing our hands, and telling school districts, well, were giving you more money but were also running up the price of the pensions, she says. So lets find a solution here where we do in fact increase the per-pupil spending so that we can increase the education of our children. Browns office responded to Eastins comments by pointing to his education actions as governor: Convincing voters to pass a November 2012 tax initiative to avoid massive cuts to education as California recovered from the Great Recession Record-high state budget funding for schools and community colleges And a new school funding formula intended to send more money to districts with the most low-income students, English language learners and foster youths. Brown has agreed to modest increases in state spending on early childhood education programs in recent years, as the state budget has stabilized. But he has opposed efforts both inside and outside the budget process to create universal preschool, citing a need to keep Californias finances in balance. Eastin even threw a personal shot at Brown, whom she quoted as saying he wasnt hurt by getting kicked out of preschool. (Eastins campaign was not able to provide any sourcing for Browns purported quote, and the governors office said it was not familiar with the governors disciplinary record in preschool.) There are two possible answers, she says. One, yes it did, Governor; and two, you are the very demographic who has the least need for preschool because Browns parents were both educated and affluent. They spoke to you and they read to you and they sang to you and they were wonderful people, Eastin went on, adding that she has the greatest respect for Jerry Browns father Pat, who served as governor from 1959 to 1967. But when it comes to education, I would argue, the last great governor of California was Pat Brown  but its not Jerry.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2017/nov/09/delaine-eastin/false-claim-california-has-built-nearly-four-times/,Politics,Polifact
3236,"Repeal Californias gas tax increase, says GOP candidate","Recently, a group of special interests threatened those daring to propose repeal of the California Democrats $5.2 billion-a-year gas-and-car tax increases. Members of the California Republican congressional delegation and taxpayer protection advocates, including the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, the National Tax Limitation Committee and taxfighter Carl DeMaio, are refusing to back down. They have pledged to take the gas tax repeal to the ballot. I, for one, commend their courage in taking on crony capitalism and the corruption that it breeds. For too long, we have permitted the Democrats to masquerade as the defenders of the poor. They are anything but. This enormous tax at the gas pump, along with the special-interest-driven cap-and-trade tax and huge increase in the vehicle license fee, together constitute an enormous, regressive tax increase. These taxes hit the working poor particularly hard, forcing families to choose between gas in the tank to get to work, or rent, or food on the table. The California Democratic leadership has been at war not only with working families but with small businesses, as well. Through overregulation and the worlds second-highest capital gains tax, California politicians have killed tens of thousands of good-paying jobs, and driven employers out of state. But worst of all, their socialist policies have created the worst poverty rate in the nation, penalizing the very people they pretend to protect. The money robbed from California families will be wasted by the California Department of Transportation, one of the worst-run bureaucracies in the country. In awarding Caltrans its 2016 Golden Fleece Award, the Independent Institute called Caltrans irresponsible for wasting billions of taxpayer dollars and said it even lied to lawmakers to cover its tracks. California spends 4.7 times the national average for every mile of roadway we build and maintain, according to the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Texas, for example, has far better roads on which it spends about $1 for every $5.80 spent by California taxpayers. In Arizona, 80 percent of that work goes out to competitive bidding, but in California, the figure is only 10 percent. Is it any wonder when a government monopoly does the job, it costs more and takes longer? We also routinely discriminate against small business and nonunion workers, which explains why unions and big business joined together to finance an extensive radio-and-newspaper campaign to promote the gas and car tax increase. The corrupting influence of the special interests is hurting all of us, including taxpayers and especially the working poor. It has made California unaffordable for most working families and given us one of the worst small-business climates in the country. By putting crony capitalism on notice, our Republican congressional delegation is showing what real leadership is all about, and in so doing, laying the groundwork for the resurgence of a Republican Party that takes its principles seriously.

Governor Abbott called the special session to address 20 conservative policy initiatives, including property tax reform, limits on state and local spending, and ending forced collection of union dues by local governments, most of which failed to pass the House during the regular session. During the month-long special session, the Texas Senate passed bills on all 20 of the Governors initiatives, while the Texas House only passed 11. The House failed to get many important bills out of committees and to the floor for a vote, indicating a lack of will among Republican leadership in the House to advance conservative priorities. Governor Abbotts top political strategist, Dave Carney, said, its pretty clear the culture of the House is corrupt, that its a non-transparent system, that doesnt allow [its members] to have an up or down vote. It has become clear that leaders in the Texas House have lost contact with the core principles of the majority of Texans. Texans deserve better. It is time for a new force for change that will remove these barriers to progress, said Don Dyer, NLPs spokesman and PAC treasurer. NLP is the culmination of discussions among a growing movement of organizations, leaders, and voters across the state. Evidence of the need for NLP is illustrated by the passage of resolutions demanding changes in House leadership by 54 (and growing) of Republican party county chapters that together represent over 50 percent of Texas Republican voters. Our growing list of contributors have been encouraged by the outpouring of support for NLP, and we are committed to find, promote and support a new crop of leaders in the House to ensure common-sense policies for all Texans, said Dyer. NLP plans to encourage and support new leadership at all levels in the Texas House during the 2018 Primary season and beyond.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2017/nov/01/new-leadership-pac/did-gop-activists-representing-majority-gop-voters/,Politics,Polifact
3512,"400,000 Texas children at risk of losing health insurance","Texas has enough funds to run its CHIP program until January or February. About 400,000 Texas children and pregnant women could lose health insurance coverage if the federal government doesnt renew funding for the Childrens Health Insurance Program. Congress missed the Sept. 30 deadline to reauthorize funding for the program, commonly known as CHIP, leaving some states with enough money for the program to last through the end of the year. Texas CHIP would run out of money in January or February. After that, the state could face a $3 billion funding hole over the next two years for the program if Congress does nothing, said Carrie Williams, spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. Weve been watching the CHIP reauthorization issue very closely. Indications are that it will be reauthorized, and we are hopeful for that, Williams said. The House and Senate are working on legislation to continue funding the program. Committees in both chambers are expected to consider the bills Wednesday. Like with any block grant program, Congress must reauthorize funding for CHIP  which covers 9 million children nationally  every few years, but it missed the most recent deadline after failed efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, according to advocacy groups. READ: Travis County DA asked to investigate anti-abortion group Most of the air has been taken out of the room by the Affordable Care Act repeal and replace effort, so I think that got pushed down the agenda, said Stacy Wilson, president of the Childrens Hospital Association of Texas. We are hoping that the bipartisan support that has traditionally underpinned CHIP will continue and that something will get passed. Established in 1997, CHIP covers children in families that have incomes above the threshold to be eligible for Medicaid but cannot afford private insurance or obtain employee coverage. In Texas, a family of four with a monthly income of $4,043 or less, or yearly income of $48,513 or less, can qualify for CHIP. The portion of uninsured Texas children at that income level has dropped from 18 percent in 1998 to 6 percent in 2015, according to the commission. CHIP covers primary health care, prescriptions, mental health, vision, physical and occupational therapies and dental care for children under 19. Additionally, about Texas 36,000 women receive CHIP coverage for prenatal and postpartum services. These are families that are working and their kids are in school, said Celia Neavel, a physician and director of the Center for Adolescent Health at Peoples Community Clinic in Austin. The cost benefit is huge. If they have chronic illnesses and you want to keep them out of the ER, you want to reduce absenteeism in school, having that ability for the kids to get comprehensive well visits, get routine follow-up, get medication, see specialists as needed, that just makes so much sense. Peoples clinic sees multiple CHIP patients a day, particularly pregnant women. LIKE US ON FACEBOOK: Our Lone Star Politics page brings Capitol news to your Facebook feed Austin resident Karen Carbajal, 29, said CHIP is a lifeline for her 1-year-old daughter and 10-year-old son, who was getting a physical at Peoples on Tuesday. We dont qualify for Medicaid. We both make too much money. I work for a car wash and (my husband) works at an automotive junk yard. CHIP is very important for our kids, she said. The bills that Congress is considering would extend the program for another five years but would phase out a 23 percent bump in the federal matching rate over the next few years. That could mean an $800 million loss for Texas in the 2020-21 biennium and possible loss of services. Currently, the federal government pays for most of the cost of the program. The money is significant in just getting that authorized, but you also have to look at how are you paying for it, and if you are paying for it from other vulnerable programs and important health programs, then concern comes up, said Anne Dunkelberg, associate director for the Center for Public Policy Priorities, an Austin-based liberal think tank. Diminishing the federal matching rate could affect another 249,000 children in the Texas Medicaid program. Federal Medicaid funding for those children is tied to the higher CHIP rate. One in 10 babies born in this country is born in Texas, and so it affects us disproportionately if access to health care is compromised for children, said Joyce Mauk, a Fort Worth physician and president of the Texas Pediatric Society. There is nothing good you can say about taking away access to health care for children.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2017/oct/12/joyce-mauk/fort-worth-pediatrician-says-1-10-us-born-babies-b/,Politics,Polifact
4348,What is the Average Cost to House Inmates in Prison,"The average cost of incarceration in the United States is determined by different methods. It costs anywhere between $20,000 and $40,000 per year to house inmates in federal and state correctional facilities; the considerable spread is due to the criteria used by government agencies and prison system watchdogs. There is consensus, however, on the high cost and burden to taxpayers produced by the U.S. penal system. Calculating Costs Per Inmate According to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, the average annual cost of incarceration in Federal prisons in 2010 was $28,284 per inmate. That cost is reduced at the Federal Community Corrections Centers; in 2010 the annual cost was $25,838. According to the California LegislativeAnalyst Office, the annual cost of incarceration in the Golden State in 2009 was $47,102 per year. To arrive at this figure, California analysts took into account the cost of security, health care, operations, administration, support, and rehabilitation programs. Annual costs per inmate in California have almost doubled since the beginning of the 21st century. Watchdog groups that keep an eye on the American judicial and penal systems often arrive at higher figures than those of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons or state agencies. The reason for this discrepancy is that watchdog groups tend to factor in court costs and other expenditures. The cost of incarceration climbs according to the level of security. The Supermaxfederal prison in Colorado spends about $60,000 per year to keep inmates in permanent isolation. The most expensive American prison is located in Cuba: Housing an inmate in Guantanamo Bay costs taxpayers approximately $900,000 per year. According to the Vera Institute of Justice, the average cost of housing an inmate in the U.S. was $31,286 in 2012. New York had the highest cost at $31,286 and Kentucky the lowest at $14,603. The Prison-Industrial Complex Since the U.S. already has the highest incarceration rate in the world, critics of the American criminal justice system warn that the rising prison costs prove the prison-industrial complex theory. The funds allocated to corrections departments across the U.S. take up a significant portion of state budgets. One of the most significant challenges that the prison-industrial complex poses to Americans is its systemic nature. The penal system is intrinsically tied to law enforcement and criminal justice; a sudden, sharp reduction in crime and incarceration rates could affect the economy created by the prison-industrial complex.

The true explanation is much less exciting. Prior to passage of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) in 1993, the state did not require those registering to provide their birth date. While most voters who registered before NVRA did provide birth dates, some did not. These voters were automatically assigned a default birth date of 01/01/1900 in the states voter rolls.

6003,Public school advocates say no voucher bills have passed in Texas Legislature,"""Texas legislators have filed voucher proposals in every legislative session since 1995, but all of them have failed to become law."" Near the start of this years legislative session, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick stood on the Capitols steps and exhorted lawmakers in the House and Senate to vote on ""school choice"" legislation, saying its ""it's easy to kill a bill when no one gets to vote on it."" An advocacy group opposed to public funds supporting students going to private and religious schools urged a different course. In a Jan. 23, 2017, press release, the Coalition for Public Schools, which says it represents religious, child advocacy and education organizations, urged the Legislature to ""focus its efforts on providing support for our neighborhood public schools instead of funneling public tax dollars"" to private school ""voucher schemes with little or no accountability for how our tax dollars are spent."" The eight-paragraph release closed with a historical claim: ""Texas legislators have filed voucher proposals in every legislative session since 1995, but all of them have failed to become law."" Thatd be a big 0-for-10 for voucher proponents because state lawmakers convene in regular session every odd-numbered year. We decided to check the record. For starters, we knew that Texans in 2017 cant access government-backed vouchers to attend nonpublic schools. Nationally as of December 2016, 27 states afforded some kind of private school choice--and 14 states had voucher plans in law, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a bipartisan group that offers ""support, ideas, connections and a strong voice on Capitol Hill"" for legislators. Wondering how the coalition reached its claim, we contacted a coalition member, the Texas Freedom Network, which says it watchdogs far-right issues, organizations, money and leaders. The networks Jose Medina, whod distributed the coalitions release, emailed us a web link to a 2007 network report including an appendix listing Texas ""voucher legislation"" dating to 1993. Medina also pointed us to the networks ""legislative watch"" web page showing bills filed under topics including vouchers from 1999 through 2015. Defining vouchers We paused to cover some definitions. Huriya Jabbar, a University of Texas education administration professor who has studied school choice and the political dimensions of education reforms, told us that ""school choice"" can include access to charter schools or the option to transfer to a different public school. Meanwhile, ""private school choice"" involves the use of public funds for private or parochial education. Asked about defining school vouchers alone, Jabbar pointed us to a 2015 article in Education Week, which covers schooling from kindergarten through high school. The article, ""What's the Difference Between Vouchers and Education Savings Accounts?,"" explains differences in private school options that often get described collectively as vouchers, a ""politically loaded term,"" the author wrote. The article says vouchers give parents ""public funding allocated for their child toward tuition at a private school of their choice, including religiously affiliated private schools."" Education savings accounts, similar to vouchers, can also pay for private tuition, the story says, though money in an account could be put toward out-of-class educational expenses such as tutoring or online enrichment. States that support such accounts set aside funds based on per-pupil funding estimates; parents may withdraw money for approved expenses, the story says. In Texas in 2017, state Sen. Larry Taylor, R-Friendswood, filed Senate Bill 3 proposing education savings accounts for students from all income levels plus scholarships for students with the ""greatest financial and academic need,"" Taylors measure states, to be supported by tax credits. Thats a funding approach taken by 17 states as of December 2016, according to the NCSL. States employ the credits, the article says, to ""incentivize businesses or individuals to donate money to a scholarship-granting organization, which then gives money to students"" to use for tuition at a private school. Texas is one of the states with constitutional amendments (often referred to as Blaine Amendments) that prohibit state funds from going to religious organizations. In those states, the Education Week article says, tax credit scholarships and education savings accounts ""offer workarounds."" We asked Josh Cunningham, an NCSL education policy specialist, if education savings accounts and tax credit scholarships would reasonably be grouped with vouchers in that each approach furthers public funding of non-public schooling. Cunningham suggested they could, as ""they all for the most part serve a similar purpose, providing support for a public school student to enter into private school."" Dozens of proposals Next, lets review what we spotted in legislation considered since the 1995 session, which we based on text searches of ""voucher,"" ""scholarship"" and ""education savings account,"" to cover bills that dealt with public funding for private school tuition. We ran the terms through both the Texas Legislative Service website Telicon and the Texas Legislature online, which is managed by the Texas Legislative Council, session by session, coming up with 29 proposed bills related to school choice with funding in the form of vouchers, scholarships or savings accounts. We then checked each of the bills listed in the Coalition for Public Schools list in both services, to account for any that our search may have missed. In total, we found 54 relevant bills from every session that covered private ""school choice"" options. Among the proposals over the years, 11 envisioned pilot programs limited to certain student populations. For instance, House Bill 2366, which didnt advance out of a House committee in 1999, called for a pilot program for ""educationally disadvantaged"" students. Six years later, HB 3042, which died in committee, more broadly called for vouchers for all students eligible to attend public schools.

A form of public school choice, short of private-school vouchers, passed into law in 1995 when lawmakers created the Public Education Grant program open to students in any school where half the students or more didnt perform satisfactorily on state tests the three previous years or the school was declared ""low performing"" by the state during those years, according to a 1997 House Research Organization summary. Under the law, each eligible student could attend a school in another district backed by the state and local funding provided for their education in their original district. In 1997, lawmakers widened such opportunities via HB 318 authorizing the state to fund up to 100 ""open-enrollment charter schools,"" which students could attend with the grants, and otherwise allowing eligible students to apply a grant to attend another school in their home districts. Among other tweaks, a student would newly be eligible if half or more of a schools students performed unsatisfactorily in any two of three previous years. A sampling of voucher proposals that died Also in 1997, Rep. Ron Wilson, D-Houston, proposed an amendment to a proposal that wouldve allowed students from low-performing schools to transfer to a private school and have tuition covered by state funds, provided the student attempted to enroll in another public school and was rejected. But House members deadlocked 68-68 on the amendment, which Wilson then withdrew after ""voucher opponents rounded up some absent members who could have killed his measure,"" according to a May 8, 1997 Houston Chronicle news article. At the time, state Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, called that moment the Houses ""closest vote ever"" on vouchers. Among other measures that would put public funds toward private school costs that didnt become law was HB 2465, offered in 2003 by Rep. Kent Grusendorf, R-Arlington and chairman of the House Public Education Committee. Grusendorfs plan would have created the Education Freedom Program for students in the states heaviest-enrollment districts. The bills analysis states that under the proposal, if a district served more than 40,000 students and a majority qualified as ""educationally disadvantaged,"" those students whose families met certain financial requirements could attend private schools with state aid. The bill won the endorsement of the House Public Education panel by 5-3, but didnt make it to the House floor before the session ended. According to minutes of the House Calendars Committee, that panel voted 7-0 on May 10, 2003, not to move the legislation to the House ""at this time."" Before the education committee acted, according to an April 4, 2003 news story in the Dallas Morning News, HB 2465 was fiercely debated with teacher groups and local school boards arguing against approval, saying the legislation would ""rob the public schools of millions of dollars at a time when many are cutting programs."" Proponents, such as Chris Patterson with the Texas Public Policy Foundation, said that some children are still left behind in Texas, despite improvements to public education over the past two decades. A dozen years later, in the 2015 legislative session, Senate Bill 4, authored by Sens. Taylor; Paul Bettencourt, R-Houston; and Donna Campbell R-New Braunfels, would have given a low-income student or a student with disabilities a tax-credit scholarship to ""attend the school of their choice,"" public or private. A bill analysis by the Senate Research Center added that the bill would have allowed businesses to make donations to an ""educational scholarship organization"" and thus receive a tax credit for the donation. According to an April 2015 news story in the Austin American-Statesman, the 31-member Senate gave preliminary approval to the bill on a ""mixed 18-12 vote after rejecting a handful of Democratic-proposed amendments to the measure."" A Democrat, Sen. Eddie Lucio, Jr. of Brownsville, voted for the proposal, the story said, with Republican Sens. Robert Nichols of Jacksonville and Konni Burton of Colleyville voting against it. In the House, where the measure died May 5, 2015 after it was referred to the Ways and Means committee, Republicans such as House Public Education Chairman Rep. Jimmie Don Aycock of Killeen expressed concern with the states abilities to hold private schools accountable to the same standards as public schools. We reached out to organizations supportive of educational savings accounts to see how this claim stacked up in their eyes -- the Texas Public Policy Foundation and Texans for Education Opportunity. The foundations Caroline Espinosa, declined to comment. We didnt hear back from Texans for Education Opportunity. Our ruling The coalition said: ""Texas legislators have filed voucher proposals in every legislative session since 1995, but all of them have failed to become law."" All told, we identified 54 failed bills, at least one in each of the 11 regular sessions from 1995 through 2015, that proposed the use of public funds for private school tuition, though not every one was a pure voucher proposal.

6122,Opinion | Floridas Vengeful Governor,"Although Ms. Ayalas critics have denounced her actions as dereliction of duty, they cannot point to a single law or statute that she has violated. Thats because she hasnt. There are no federal or state laws that say prosecutors must seek death sentences. And the United States Supreme Court has banned all state laws that make executions mandatory for murders. The governors executive order also undercuts the will of the people who last fall elected Ms. Ayala to serve them. Moreover, a poll last year found that nearly two-thirds of Floridians prefer life imprisonment over the imposition of the death penalty. So do people who live in Central Florida, where her district is, 58 percent to 36 percent. As a black man, I see the death penalty as a powerful symbol of injustice in which race often determines who lives and who dies, especially in Florida. The state has the second-largest number of death row inmates in the country, after California, and African-Americans are grossly overrepresented on Floridas death row. This disproportionality was a driving force behind my bill. And while I felt that Florida was not ready to relinquish the death penalty, I tried to make it more fair. Ms. Ayalas arguments for rejecting the death penalty were compelling and well reasoned; they were drawn from the stark racial disparities in the criminal justice system that she confronts every day. Yet Ms. Ayala has always said that she would hold the guilty accountable, including, if he is convicted, the defendant in the first case from which she was removed, Markeith Loyd. Understandably, the issue of how to punish people who kill police officers remains highly charged, especially among law enforcement officials. Many believe that the only proper resolution for the death of Lt. Debra Clayton, the Orlando police officer Mr. Loyd is accused of killing, is an eye for an eye. I get that. But for others, including Stephanie Dixon-Daniels, the mother of Mr. Loyds slain ex-girlfriend, who has also experienced a devastating loss, Ms. Ayalas sentencing choice made sense. The death penalty will continue to drag us back in court and relive this violent, hideous act, Ms. Dixon-Daniels said. Instead, she wants closure.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2017/apr/06/randolph-bracy/has-us-supreme-court-banned-all-state-laws-make-ex/,Politics,Polifact

7875,"Buckingham, Leeder vie for open Hill Country state Senate seat","The race to replace retiring 20-year state Sen. Troy Fraser, R-Horseshoe Bay, will pit Republican Dawn Buckingham against Democrat Virginia Jennie Lou Leeder to represent a district that has traditionally been a GOP stronghold. Early voting for the Nov. 8 election begins Oct. 24. Leeder, chairwoman of Llano Countys Democratic Party from 2007-15, is the first Democrat since 1996 to seek election to Senate District 24, which encompasses 17 counties that stretch from the Hill Country to Abilene, including a slice of western Travis County. A seventh-generation Texan and a Llano resident, Leeder emphasizes her rural roots with a focus on better funding for education, particularly for higher teacher salaries, as well as improving hospital access and the roads and bridges in the district. Im from rural Texas, and I feel like I can relate to the voters. I think its important to understand their pain and what they are going through, she said. They want a senator who understands life in rural Texas. NEWS STRAIGHT TO YOUR INBOX: Click here to get our Morning Headlines email Buckingham, a Lakeway eye surgeon who served on the Lake Travis school board for a year before resigning to run for the Senate, describes herself as a Christian, liberty-minded candidate prepared for tough choices when the Legislature crafts a two-year budget with the states oil and gas industry hurting. I think in a tight budget year, youre going to have to look for opportunities to cut taxes, spending and unnecessary regulations, Buckingham said. We talk about decreasing the footprint of government. It needs to be smaller and less intrusive into our daily lives  and it will cost us less. She supports beefing up security along the border with Mexico and wants to fight sanctuary city policies that discourage police and jail personnel from enforcing immigration laws. Border security, both for our economic viability and the safety of our communities, truly is our No. 1 issue, said Buckingham, 48. The Republican also favors reducing the power of state bureaucrats and unions in local schools and said she would vote for school choice, which would let students attend private schools with public education money. All of our kids need to have the opportunity to go to a good school, not just the wealthy kids, Buckingham said. Leeder, who taught agriculture and physical education for 11 years and is now a swim coach, wants to improve education by overhauling the school finance system to ensure that the state better meets its financial obligations to students. Llano, like many other school districts, is having trouble making ends meet under the current Robin Hood system that siphons money from property-rich districts for distribution to property-poorer ones, she said. We spend more per day to house an inmate than we do on a student, said Leeder, 50. Leeder wants to champion policies that would bring more hospitals and trauma treatment centers to the district. There are places in the 17 counties where people are driving over 50 miles to get good health care, and that is just not acceptable, she said. The Democrat also is concerned by dangerous roads  some without a shoulder, others with unrepaired potholes  in the district, and she wants to put bridges on a tighter inspection schedule. Leeder, however, is far behind in fundraising. In a campaign finance report filed 30 days before the election, the Democrat had $9,377 in the bank after raising $11,620 over the previous three months. Buckingham, in contrast, had $154,037 on hand after raising $195,484 in the same period.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2016/nov/18/jennie-lou-leeder/democrat-jennie-lou-leeder-says-texas-spends-more-/,Politics,Polifact
7950,Trump fans rally above interstate,"Peering over the Tucker Street overpass Tuesday, Barry Brown and roughly a dozen other Donald Trump supporters waved flags at the passing motorists below. Im out here today because we as Americans have taken God out of America, said Brown, of Liberty, who said he began his Flagging 40 initiative on Alamance County Interstate 40/85 overpasses in February. I believe that a Trump America would be great for America. As he did Tuesday afternoon, each of those times since February, Brown has flown both a Christian and an American flag. On Tuesday, he was joined by other conservative demonstrators holding Trump and Gadsden Dont Tread On Me flags, along with more Christian and American flags. Browns estimate of how many times he has waved flags over I-40/85 since February was 15 to 30. He said the initiative has grown organically, as other local conservatives learned about and saw what he was doing and decided to join him, each time showing up with their own flags. Nievelis Bittman, there representing the Alamance County Republican Party, was among those who wanted to join Brown in supporting the cause. Were fighting for freedom, said Bittman, a Cuban immigrant to the United States wearing a pin on her chest that read GOP: Gods Official Party. I came from Cuba looking for freedom. Shes a woman for Trump, Brown said of Bittman as the two stood on the overpass holding flags. Oh, definitely, Bittman said. I was there yesterday in Raleigh. Brown said reactions to the demonstrators had been mixed, though as the group continued Tuesday, vehicles were continually honking at them both from the interstate below and the road where they stood. Ive got people that are waving, people that are giving us thumbs up, Brown said. Ive had people give us one finger gestures. Whether they cant get all their fingers up at once or not  I dont understand, holding the Christian flag and the American flag, what exactly theyre flipping off. Either theyre flipping off Jesus Christ or theyre flipping off America. Though other supporters briefly stood on the University Drive overpass, Brown said he went out to Tucker Street around 2:30 p.m. and would be staying there til dark.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2016/nov/09/viral-image/viral-image-debunked-kkk-was-not-marching-north-ca/,Politics,Polifact

11951,Strickland switches on gun rights,"WASHINGTON - There was nothing subtle about the TV commercial in 2010. As Gov. Ted Strickland held a hunting rifle, an announcer said that as a member of the U.S. House in 1994, Republican gubernatorial candidate John Kasich ""voted to take away our gun rights - a major reason the National Rifle Association gave Strickland an A-plus rating."" Fast-forward to today, and the same Ted Strickland, who faces a contested U.S. Senate Democratic primary race in March against Cincinnati City Councilman P.G. Sittenfeld, has become an advocate of the type of gun restrictions he once opposed. WASHINGTON - There was nothing subtle about the TV commercial in 2010. As Gov. Ted Strickland held a hunting rifle, an announcer said that as a member of the U.S. House in 1994, Republican gubernatorial candidate John Kasich ""voted to take away our gun rights - a major reason the National Rifle Association gave Strickland an A-plus rating."" Fast-forward to today, and the same Ted Strickland, who faces a contested U.S. Senate Democratic primary race in March against Cincinnati City Councilman P.G. Sittenfeld, has become an advocate of the type of gun restrictions he once opposed. It is one of the most-dramatic reversals in Ohio politics since 1990, when Democratic gubernatorial candidate Anthony J. Celebrezze jettisoned his lifelong opposition to abortion rights, a move that hurt him in the general election when he lost to Republican George V. Voinovich. And even as Strickland's aides insist that he became an advocate of new gun restrictions in the wake of the shooting deaths of 20 children and six adults in 2012 at a Connecticut elementary school, some analysts suggest the former governor realizes that opposition to gun restrictions could hurt him among Democratic primary voters who tend to back tougher gun laws. The winner of the primary race between Sittenfeld and Strickland will face Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who almost certainly will have support of gun-rights organizations. The issue has intensified in the wake of mass shootings in Colorado Springs, Colo., last month when three people were killed at a Planned Parenthood facility, and this month in San Bernardino, Calif., where two Islamic State sympathizers killed 14. ""People's opinions really do change over time,"" said John Green, director of the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron. ""But the political problem is, when a candidate is strongly committed to a particular point of view, advertises about it, and then changes their mind in the run-up to a campaign, this raises a lot of suspicions."" To Sittenfeld, Strickland's reversal smacks of ""an election-year conversion. No one can erase or run from his record, and his record on guns is long and it's crystal clear."" Strickland's staff members declined requests to make the former governor available for an interview. But David Bergstein, a Strickland spokesman, said, ""Ted's views about gun violence and gun safety have been deeply influenced as a result of the multiple horrific incidents of gun violence that our country has suffered, and particularly after the Sandy Hook tragedy (in Connecticut). ""Just like many Americans, after Sandy Hook, he called for a reassessment of laws in order to help keep Ohioans and all Americans safer,"" Bergstein said. In particular, Bergstein said Strickland would have supported a bill sponsored in 2013 by Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania that would have expanded criminal-background checks to people buying guns at gun shows or on the Internet. The bill failed to pass the Senate. Bergstein said Strickland wants to ban those on the terrorist no-fly list from buying guns, adding that the former governor ""believes that stopping the epidemic of gun violence is too important for any politician to try and play games with, and his most important priority will always be to keep Ohioans safe."" When asked to produce any statement Strickland made before this year about changing his views on gun control, the Strickland campaign cited articles from the Associated Press and Wooster Daily Record from December 2012 when he called for a commission to consider the nation's gun laws. ""This country is facing a culture of violence that is intolerable and cannot just simply be accepted as a way of life,"" Strickland was quoted as saying in the Daily Record. ""I think the NRA, I think the entertainment industry, I think the political class all need to sit down, and we need to avoid the extremes,"" adding that ""there needs to be a recognition that we cannot continue to lose thousands and thousands of innocent people to gun violence."" Dale Butland, a Sittenfeld spokesman, said Strickland's comments from 2012 are ""why people don't trust career politicians."" ""Three years ago, after 20 first-graders were slaughtered by a lunatic with an assault rifle, the best Ted Strickland could do was call for a government commission to 'study' the problem. ""Not one word about changing his mind on background checks,"" Butland said. ""Not one word about reversing his position on assault weapons. And not one word about these or any other gun-related issues after all the other mass shootings that have occurred since Sandy Hook."" But David Leland, former chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party and a Strickland supporter, said, ""The whole country is moving in a more thoughtful direction on the gun issue. ""I don't think Ted Strickland is different than the vast majority of people in this country who recognize the Second Amendment but also realize with any kind of freedom there also needs to be some restrictions that apply to them,"" said Leland, now a state representative from Columbus. During his years in the U.S. House and as governor, there was nothing lukewarm about Strickland's support of gun rights. As a U.S. House member from Lucasville in 1994, he voted against a ban on the production and sale of 19 semiautomatic assault weapons, calling it a ""misdirected effort aimed at law-abiding citizens."" By contrast, Kasich, a Republican from Westerville, supported the ban, which prompted Strickland's commercial attacking Kasich during the 2010 gubernatorial race. In 1993, Strickland joined 68 other House Democrats in voting against the Brady Bill, which required a waiting period before anyone could buy a handgun as well as creation of an instant criminal-background check before people could buy any kind of gun. ""We endorsed him for governor in 2010,"" said Jim Irvine, president of the Buckeye Firearms Association. ""But since then he has kind of really fallen off into all sorts of nonsense on this issue. ""I can't imagine that somebody who knows what he knows (on gun laws) can take the positions he is,"" Irvine said. ""He is absolutely wrong, and he should know he's wrong."" _EMAIL_ @jacktorry1",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2016/may/13/fighting-ohio-pac/fighting-ohio-pac-ad-takes-ted-stricklands-mixed-a/,Politics,Polifact
12558,Remarks by the President at DNC Hope Fund Dallas Reception,"Gilleys Club Dallas, Texas 10:14 A.M. CST THE PRESIDENT: Hello, Dallas, Texas! (Applause.) Oh, it is good to see all of you! (Applause.) Everybody, please have a seat. Have a seat. It is good to see you on a Saturday morning. (Applause.) Theres a good-looking crowd here. You know, I think Ron Kirk wants to run for something again. (Laughter.) Matrice, he came up here, hes starting to get kind of -- he was getting into it, wasnt he? (Laughter.) I'm telling you. Listen, I love me some Ron Kirk. I really do. It's true I love Matrice more. (Laughter.) But Ron and Matrice could not be better friends. And he was not only a great mayor of this city, but he was a great ambassador on our behalf all across the country. So please give him a big round of applause. (Applause.) Your current Mayor, Mike Rawlings, is here. (Applause.) He reminds me that he had to clean up all kinds of stuff after Ron was mayor, but -- (laughter) -- it's turned out okay. One of our most wonderful representatives, and somebody whos been an incredible friend and partner to me over the years during my presidency -- Eddie Bernice Johnson. Give her a big round of applause. (Applause.) She's always had my back. And Hall-of-Famer -- (applause) -- and dear friend and really a pretty good dancer -- Emmitt Smith is in the house. (Applause.) Looking sharp in his three-piece. So I came to Texas because I wanted to visit South by Southwest yesterday. And I had a great time. And it's a fun event, it's an interesting event. For those of you who have not been there, theres a lot of tech folks and new ideas. And I was slotted among a panel -- there were a bunch of different panels, like Keep Mars Weird was one panel. (Laughter.) And then there was Robot Armageddon. That was another panel. (Laughter.) And I decided to keep quiet and not remind people that there actually is a robot rover on Mars. They might have not -- anyway. (Laughter.) But it was wonderful to be in Austin. It's wonderful to be in Dallas. And were here today because we know how deeply this years elections matter. If anybody tells you elections do not matter, think about 2008. Some of you were along for that ride. You know how much that election mattered. And the one after that. Because when I took office, we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, and unemployment was on its way to 10 percent. And today, our businesses have created jobs for 72 straight months -- six straight years; 14.3 million new jobs. (Applause.) Unemployment below 5 percent. Thats change. That's what we fought for. That's why elections matter. (Applause.) When I took office, American manufacturing was in a decade of decline and the auto industry was flat on its back. And today, the auto industry just had its best year ever. (Applause.) And over the past six years, weve created 900,000 new manufacturing jobs. Thats why elections matter. That's what change is all about. (Applause.) When I took office, tens of millions of Americans went without the security of health insurance. And today, thanks to the Affordable Care Act -- also known as -- AUDIENCE: Obamacare! THE PRESIDENT: -- Obamacare, 20 million more Americans are covered. (Applause.) And for the first time ever, more than 90 percent of Americans have health insurance. That is change. And they said it was going to kill jobs, but ever since I signed that bill into law, our businesses have created jobs every single month right here in the United States of America. (Applause.) When I took office, we were hopelessly addicted to foreign oil. Today, weve cut our imports by more than half. Oil and natural gas production in the United States is at an all-time high, but we've also tripled the power we generate from wind. (Applause.) We generate 30 times more solar power than we did when I came into office -- (applause) -- leading the world to combat climate change; creating good, new clean-energy jobs. That's change that you can believe in. That's why elections matter. (Applause.) When I took office, 180,000 troops were serving in harms way in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, about 90 percent of those folks are home. And we could not be more grateful for their service and their sacrifice. And we are also glad that they are reunited with their families. (Applause.) And we still have a job to do going after ISIL and those who would do us harm. But were pursuing a broader vision that uses every element of our national power, including diplomacy, to keep America safe and to keep America strong. (Applause.) When I took office, the right to marry who you love was limited to two states. Now it's in all 50 states, from coast to coast. Thats change you can believe in. (Applause.) So weve been busy. (Laughter.) We've been busy. We've been as busy as a one-eyed dog in a smokehouse. (Laughter.) I heard that saying while I was down here. (Applause.) And were still busy, still hustling -- got more work to do. When cynics told us we could not change this country that we love so much they were wrong. If somebody had told you seven years ago that wed have 4.9 percent unemployment, and 20 million newly insured, and gas at a buck-eighty, and deficits cut by three-quarters, and marriage equality a reality, and bin Laden out of the picture -- you wouldnt have bought what they were selling. Youd have said, oh, they were just hollering down a well. (Laughter.) But the truth of the matter is America is pretty darn great right now. (Applause.) America is making strides right now. America is better off than it was right now. The American people should be proud about what weve achieved together over the last eight years since the recession hit. We're great right now! (Applause.) And what the folks who are running for office should be focused on is how we can make it even better. Not insults and schoolyard taunts, and manufacturing facts. (Applause.) Not divisiveness along the lines of race or faith. Certainly not violence against other Americans or excluding them. Were a better country than that. And whats been happening in our politics lately is not an accident. For years, weve been told we should be angry about America, and that the economy is a disaster, and that were weak and that compromise is weakness, and that you can ignore science and you can ignore facts, and say whatever you want about the President, and feed suspicion about immigrants and Muslims and poor people, and people who arent like us, and say that the reason that America is in decline is because of those people. That didnt just happen last week. That narrative has been promoted now for years. It didnt just spring out of nowhere. And of course, none of it has been true. It just ignores reality -- the reality that America is the most powerful nation on Earth. The reality that our economy is not only stronger than it was eight years ago, that its, right now, the bright spot in the world. That our diversity is a strength -- a great gift -- that makes us the envy of every other nation. (Applause.) So the narrative that's been pushed is false. Demonstrably false. And we shouldnt be surprised then when, in the heat of political season, it starts getting carried away. But we've got to say no to that. We can have political debates without turning on one another. We can have political debates without thinking that the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice. We can support candidates without treating their opponents as unpatriotic, or treasonous, or somehow deliberately trying to weaken America. That's not just one candidate whos been saying that; some of the so-called more responsible candidates, including a gentleman from this state -- no, no, you read what he says, it's not -- it's no more rooted in reality than some of these other statements. We can point out bad policies without describing them as a government takeover or an assault on freedom. And by the way, when I say this, this is not about political correctness. Its about not having to explain to our kids why our politics sounds like a schoolyard fight. We shouldnt be afraid to take them to rallies, or let them watch debates. They watch the way we conduct ourselves. They learn from us. And we should be teaching them something about this democracy is a vibrant and precious thing. It's going to be theirs someday, and we should be teaching them how to disagree without being disagreeable, and how to engage, and how to analyze facts, and how to be honest and truthful, and admit if you make a mistake, and teach them that politics at its best is about a battle of ideas, and resolving our differences without encouraging or resorting to violence. And our leaders, those who aspire to be our leaders should be trying to bring us together, and not turning us against one another -- (applause) -- and speak out against violence, and reject efforts to spread fear or turn us against one another. (Applause.) And if they refuse to do that, they dont deserve our support. (Applause.) The best leaders, the leaders who are worthy of our votes, remind us that even in a country as big and diverse and inclusive as ours, what weve got in common is far more important than what divides any of us. In 2008, we had rallies with 50,000, 80,000, 100,000 people. I'm not bragging, I'm just saying we had -- (applause) -- we had some big rallies. Sometimes you hear folks say, oh, that rally is big. I say, I don't know. (Laughter.) We had some pretty big rallies. (Applause.) I'm just saying. We had one in Austin, Texas -- Ron remembers this, he was there -- 20,000 people, more than 20,000 people back in Austin. And I was telling the folks down in Austin, you remember -- I saw a guy, he had a nice-looking black cowboy hat. I said, that's a nice hat. And he took it off and he handed it to me. He said, you take it. And it fit really good. (Laughter.) I looked really good in it, and somebody took a picture of it. But I can't find that hat. AUDIENCE: Awww -- THE PRESIDENT: So if you're still out there, sir -- (applause) -- (someone tries to hand the President his cowboy hat.) No, man, that looks good on you, brother, but I -- when I come down to shake hands I may see if it fits. (Applause.) That's why I love Texas, right there. (Applause.) But my point, going back -- I got a little waylaid -- Americans were frustrated back then, too -- upset about the wars in Iraq, anxious about the housing crisis, anxious about the financial crisis that eventually would send the markets plunging and unemployment soaring, and people losing their homes and their pensions. And all that happened while we were campaigning. But somebody who went to those rallies, there wasnt a spirit of anger or meanness. People were hopeful. People were looking about how do we bring folks together. We tried to offer something different. We tried to offer something better. We believed that we were greater together; that were not as divided as our politics suggest. (Applause.) And as Democrats, thats what weve got to keep offering now -- a politics that reflects the best in us, and not the worst in us. (Applause.) Weve got to strive to hold ourselves to a higher standard. We've got to do better. We've got to offer a better path for America. And we know what we believe -- and by the way, when you know what you believe, when you know what you're for, you don't have to spend all your time trying to find somebody to be against. (Applause.) We believe the economy grows faster when everybody gets a fair shot, not just a few people. And we're not going to let Republicans roll back our progress by letting big banks or hedge funds make their own rules at the expense of everybody else. Were going to build on our progress, and rebuild our infrastructure, raise the minimum wage, and make college more affordable; and meet our obligations to the poor and the vulnerable; and work on family leave and paid leave and early education, so that everybody gets a shot at life. (Applause.) That's what we believe. Thats what we're about. We're for something, not just against something. (Applause.) AUDIENCE MEMBER: Four more years! THE PRESIDENT: No, I can't do that. We believe that in a country as wealthy as ours, everybody should have access to health care. And we made progress, but we've got more to do. Right here in Texas, your governor could cover over a million more Texans under Medicaid with the stroke of a pen -- (applause) -- 40,000 women could get mammograms that need it each year with the stroke of a pen. He wont do it -- not because it's not the right thing to do, but because of politics. And we should not be putting peoples health ahead of politics -- we should be putting peoples health ahead of politics. (Applause.) Shouldnt be putting politics ahead of health care. (Applause.) As Democrats, we believe in things like science. (Applause.) It has resulted in great improvements in our lives. Science -- that's why we have things like penicillin and airplanes. (Laughter.) So we appreciate science. We appreciate scientists. And when scientists tell us that climate change is real, we should not be wasting time debating whether climate change is real. Were working together to make sure we create good clean energy jobs that pay better than average. Right now, here in Texas, wind power is already cheaper than dirty fossil fuels. We can't let Republicans roll back this progress by letting special interests write their own rules, and just keep on subsidizing the past instead of investing in the future. (Applause.) Thats what we believe in. We're not just against something, we're for something. (Applause.) Does anybody have any idea what the other side is for right now? AUDIENCE: No! AUDIENCE MEMBER: What are they for? THE PRESIDENT: I don't know. (Laughter.) Q They don't either! THE PRESIDENT: They don't. That's why theyre selling wine. (Applause.) I had to say to -- I told the folks down in Austin, I said, has anybody bought that wine? (Laughter.) I want to know what that wine tastes like. (Laughter.) I mean, come on, you know that's like some $5 wine. (Laughter.) They slap a label on it, they charge you $50, saying this is the greatest wine ever. (Laughter.) Come on! (Laughter.) Oh, boy -- selling wine. (Laughter.) That's not what we're for. Couldn't make it up. (Laughter.) As Democrats, our top national security priority is protecting the American people, going after terrorist networks. For over a year and a half, we've led a coalition of more than 60 countries, hunting down and destroying ISIL -- going after their financial networks; going after their leadership; going after their infrastructure. We don't do it with phony bluster. We don't go around talking stuff; we do. (Applause.) More 10,000 airstrikes. Our men and women in uniform, our Special Forces right there taking care of business. Progress is not made by over-the-top claims and suggestions that we're going to carpet-bomb innocent people. That doesnt strengthen Americas leadership around the world. We don't strengthen our position, our standing, we don't make ourselves safer by insulting Muslims around the world, pitting groups of Americans against each other. Were going to keep America safe and strong and respected around the world by doing the right thing -- (applause) -- and using all the elements of our power. Thats what Democrats believe in. (Applause.) That's what we believe in. That's what we're for. We're not just against something. As Democrats, by the way, we believe our right to vote should be easier to exercise, not harder. (Applause.) I love folks who say how much they love the Constitution, love the American way, and then do everything they can to make sure that Americans can't vote. (Applause.) Right here in Texas, Republicans have systematically made it harder to register, and harder to vote. Four years ago, Texas ranked in the bottom five in voter turnout. Two years ago, it ranked in the bottom three; 16 million eligible voters, 7 million unregistered. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Wow! THE PRESIDENT: And that's not an accident. It's on purpose. It's systematically been structured to prevent more folks from voting -- discourage more folks from voting. So I'll tell you what Democrats believe. We believe that despite those efforts, we're going to go ahead and make sure we've got big turnout. (Applause.) We're going to prove everything is bigger in Texas, and get more folks registered, and get them to the polls. (Applause.) Tell them, Dont Mess with Texass right to vote! (Applause That's what we believe in -- that everybody should participate, everybody should be involved, everybody has got a voice, everybody has got a say! (Applause.) Our country works better that way. Black, white. Asian, Latino. Gay, straight. Immigrant, native-born. You look around this state -- it's home to everybody. People from all kinds of places. Thats what makes the Lone Star State great. That's what makes America great. And that's why I'm proud to be a Democrat -- because that's what the Democratic Party looks like. (Applause.) We believe at our core that everybody deserves an equal shot. We fight for people who haven't had the same chances we have; fight for kids who may not have the same opportunities that our kids have, no matter where they are, what they look like, where they come from. We believe they should be able to make it. We look out for somebody elses kids, not just our own, because we know when our kids grow up, then theyll be living in a better world if somebody elses kid has a chance, too. That's what we stand for. That's what we stand for as Democrats. That's what we stand for as Americans. Thats whats at stake this year. Thats why Im so proud to have all of you on our team. (Applause.) So lets get to work, Dallas! Lets get to work, Texas! (Applause.) Lets move this country forward! Lets remember what we're for -- lets not just be against something. Lets lift up hope! (Applause.) Lets remind ourselves of just how much progress we've made and that when people who love their country decide to come together, nothing can stop them. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. (Applause.) Thank you. (Applause.) END 10:38 A.M.

13053,Supreme Court vacancies in presidential election years,"In the wake of the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, questions have arisen about whether there is a standard practice of not nominating and confirming Supreme Court Justices during a presidential election year. The historical record does not reveal any instances since at least 1900 of the president failing to nominate and/or the Senate failing to confirm a nominee in a presidential election year because of the impending election. In that period, there were several nominations and confirmations of Justices during presidential election years. The first nomination during an election year in the twentieth century came on March 13, 1912, when President William Taft (a Republican) nominated Mahlon Pitney to succeed John Marshall Harlan, who died on October 14, 1911. The Republican-controlled Senate confirmed Pitney on March 18, 1912, by a vote of fifty to twenty-six. President Woodrow Wilson (a Democrat) made two nominations during 1916. On January 28, 1916, Wilson nominated Louis Brandeis to replace Joseph Rucker Lamar, who died on January 2, 1916; the Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed Brandeis on June 1, 1916, by a vote of forty-seven to twenty-two. Charles Evans Hughes resigned from the Court on June 10, 1916 to run (unsuccessfully) for president as a Republican. On July 14, 1916, Wilson nominated John Clarke to replace him; Clarke was confirmed unanimously ten days later. On February 15, 1932, President Herbert Hoover (a Republican) nominated Benjamin Cardozo to succeed Oliver Wendell Holmes, who retired on January 12, 1932. A Republican-controlled Senate confirmed Cardozo by a unanimous voice vote on February 24, 1932. On January 4, 1940, President Franklin Roosevelt (a Democrat) nominated Frank Murphy to replace Pierce Butler, who died on November 16, 1939; Murphy was confirmed by a heavily Democratic Senate on January 16, 1940, by a voice vote. On November 30, 1987, President Ronald Reagan (a Republican) nominated Justice Anthony Kennedy to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Lewis Powell. A Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed Kennedy (who followed Robert Bork and Douglas Ginsburg as nominees for that slot) on February 3, 1988, by a vote of ninety-seven to zero. In two instances in the twentieth century, presidents were not able to nominate and confirm a successor during an election year. But neither reflects a practice of leaving a seat open on the Supreme Court until after the election. On September 7, 1956, Sherman Minton announced his intent to retire in a letter to President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and he served until October 15, 1956. With the Senate already adjourned, Eisenhower made a recess appointment of William J. Brennan to the Court shortly thereafter; Brennan was formally nominated to the Court and confirmed in 1957. The fact that Eisenhower put Brennan on the Court is inconsistent with any tradition of leaving a seat vacant. And in 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson nominated Abe Fortas, who was already sitting as an Associate Justice, to succeed Chief Justice Earl Warren, but the Fortas nomination was the target of a bipartisan filibuster  principally in reaction to the Warren Courts liberalism and ethical questions about Fortas, although objections were certainly also made that it was inappropriate to fill the seat in an election year. That filibuster prompted Homer Thornberry, whom Johnson nominated to succeed Fortas as an Associate Justice, to withdraw his name from consideration in October 1968, because there was no vacancy to fill. Moreover, the failure to confirm Fortas as the Chief Justice did not leave the Court short a Justice, because Chief Justice Earl Warren remained on the bench.

13104,D.C.'s Ban On Handguns In Homes Is Thrown Out,"A federal appeals court ruled yesterday that the District's longtime ban on keeping handguns in homes is unconstitutional. The 2 to 1 decision by an appellate panel outraged D.C. Mayor Adrian M. Fenty and other city leaders, who said that they will appeal and that gun-related crimes could rise if the ruling takes effect. The outcome elated opponents of strict gun controls because it knocked down one of the toughest laws in the country and vindicated their interpretation of the U.S. Constitution's language on the right to bear arms. The panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit became the nation's first federal appeals court to overturn a gun-control law by declaring that the Second Amendment grants a person the right to possess firearms. One other circuit shares that viewpoint on individual rights, but others across the country say the protection that the Second Amendment offers relates to states being able to maintain a militia. Legal experts said the conflict could lead to the first Supreme Court review of the issue in nearly 70 years. The District's law bars all handguns unless they were registered before 1976; it was passed that year to try to curb gun violence, but it has come under attack during the past three decades in Congress and in the courts. Yesterday's ruling guts key parts of the law but does not address provisions that effectively bar private citizens from carrying guns outside the home. Fenty (D) said the city is committed to pursuing additional appeals, adding: ""I am personally deeply disappointed and frankly outraged by this decision. It flies in the face of laws that have helped decrease gun violence in the District of Columbia."" City attorneys said that it would take at least 30 days for the court's decision to go into effect, during which time the District probably will file its appeal. During an appeal, which could last more than a year, the current law would remain in effect, the lawyers said. Fenty said city officials will ""do everything in our power to work to get the decision overturned, and we will vigorously enforce our handgun laws during that time."" The ruling was the latest development in four years of litigation waged by six D.C. residents who said they wanted to keep guns in their homes for self-defense. Alan Gura, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said, ""This is a tremendous victory for the civil rights of all Americans."" Senior Judge Laurence H. Silberman wrote the majority opinion, also signed by Thomas B. Griffith. Karen LeCraft Henderson dissented. All three were appointed by Republican presidents. ""We conclude that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms,"" Silberman said in the 58-page majority ruling. The residents filed their lawsuit -- Parker v. the District of Columbia-- months after then-Attorney General John D. Ashcroft declared that gun bans violate the Second Amendment. They were aided by the Cato Institute, a nonprofit group that advocates personal liberties. The suit said the ban on handgun ownership violates the Second Amendment, which states: ""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.""",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2016/mar/18/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-wrongly-says-merrick-garland-voted-ba/,Politics,Polifact

The President has chosen a man with amazing credentials, a mastery of the law and a history of independent legal thought.

For us to be the best nation possible, we must have a full Supreme Court, ready to hear cases that will determine our future as a nation.

13405,House Speaker Ryan: Americans are upset; they economy is on the wrong track,"House Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday the rise of Donald Trump can be explained by voters being fed up that America is on the wrong track. Ryan blamed the liberal policies of President Barack Obama. ""You have conservatives, like myself ... who are very upset about the direction of the country,"" Ryan told CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""You have people in America panicked because they have economic anxiety."" Ryan, who was the GOP vice presidential candidate in 2012, is not supporting any one candidate as the 2016 nomination contests continue. ""There's nothing we can do about what's going on in the presidential election and what the outcome of that is in Congress,"" Ryan said. He said he's concentrating on crafting a conservative agenda that a Republican president can help execute. Trump, the GOP front-runner, takes his weekend win in South Carolina and his victory earlier this month in New Hampshire into Tuesday's Nevada caucuses. Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are hoping to halt Trump's roll.

The 'Superman building' is vacant another year!,"As the sun set on 2015, Rhode Island's tallest building stood empty, concluding another year of vacancy. As the city below lit up with New Year's Eve revelry, the former Industrial Trust building's 1,500 windows remained dark. And as golden doors etched with art deco eagles reflected the soaring heights of the 26-floor building's storied past, Scotch tape held in place flimsy signs reflecting today's street-level reality: ""No Loitering."" Earlier in the day, the principal owner agreed to lead a tour of the tower that many call the ""Superman building"" because it resembles the Daily Planet building in the old ""Superman"" TV show. (On TV, it was actually Los Angeles City Hall). The tour began in the former Bank of America lobby  a grand space where marble floors, dark columns and high ceilings recall another era but where a counter-top calendar recalls the day that the bank moved out: April 12, 2013. David C. Sweetser, founder and principal of Massachusetts-based High Rock Development LLC, said he hopes to secure some sort of public support in the new year to spur redevelopment of the iconic skyscraper  either as apartments, offices, graduate student housing or some mix of uses. His New Year's wish for the property: ""We would like it to be contributing to the local economy. We would like it to be tenanted."" But in Rhode Island these days, subsidy can be a four-letter word. While New Year's Eve produced quite a few headaches, perhaps no hangover was as epic as the one that Rhode Islanders felt following the 38 Studios debacle. And while that ball was dropped five years ago, High Rock ran into opposition just last year when it sought $39 million in state money, plus city tax breaks and historic tax credits, to try to convert the Superman building into 278 apartments. On the other hand, 2016 will begin with work under way to convert the old South Street Power Station into Brown University offices and a state college nursing education center, and that project relied on some $50 million in state and federal tax credits, plus state lease payments that will total an estimated $6 million a year. Sweetser said he is ""encouraged by the vision"" shown by Governor Raimondo and Providence Mayor Jorge O. Elorza, who just completed their first years in office, and by House Speaker Nicholas A. Mattiello and Senate President M. Teresa Paiva Weed. He noted, for example, that the state has adopted new economic development ""tools,"" such as the Rebuild Rhode Island tax credit program, and that officials are trying to attract developers to the former Route 195 land in Providence. And he said that, in general, people are expressing more interest in the building's future than they have in years. ""In previous years, we were somewhat on the defensive. Now, I don't feel on the defensive,"" Sweetser said. ""It has taken us four years of discussions, education, planning, negotiations, to be where we are today, and we can just feel a vibrancy that we have not felt before, with people acknowledging there needs to be something done with 111 Westminster Street."" But why can't something be done with 111 Westminster without public aid? Sweetser, who lives in Wellesley, Massachusetts, said the reality is that Boston is just 60 minutes away and it's offering subsidies to developers who can charge higher rent than you can get in Providence, while construction costs are more or less equal. As a result, the Boston skyline ""is completely dominated by the cranes,"" he said. ""With subsidies  you mention that word and everyone kind of cringes,"" Sweetser said. ""We wish we didn't need subsidies. I'm sure the state wishes we didn't need them. But unfortunately, it's an economic reality. So either you have no subsidies and nothing will happen, or everybody has to compromise, including me."" With public support, ""you will have a contributing building with employees or tenants, paying taxes, contributing to the economic welfare of the city and the state,"" he said. High Rock spokesman William Fischer said, ""Inactivity is not neutral. It is a negative. We have a hole in the skyline. If it were to be residential, you'd have an influx of 450 people here, going to restaurants, working, paying taxes."" Without subsidies, ""think about what this town would look like  there would be no Renaissance Hotel, no Arcade, no G Building, no Westminster corridor,"" he said. ""They used to call it the Renaissance City  it's time for a new renaissance."" But Samuel W. Bell, state coordinator of the Rhode Island Progressive Democrats, isn't buying it, and his comments are one indication of the opposition that could come from both the right and the left. ""They bought it for more than it was probably worth,"" he said of High Rock's $33.2-million purchase in 2008. ""But I don't think it's the role of the public to bail out businesses that make decisions that aren't good."" High Rock could sell the building at a loss, Bell said. ""But I think they are sitting on it, waiting for a big subsidy. So this is a case where the culture of subsidies is discouraging development, and it's creating this large eyesore."" Bell, who helped lead a successful battle against a Providence baseball stadium proposal that called for public funding, said, ""The people of Rhode Island are fed up with the culture of corporate welfare. To me, it is symbolic of developers refusing to accept what the market has said and asking for a big state handout."" Also, he said he's concerned the project could end up producing ""luxury apartments"" and ""severely exacerbate the affordable-housing crisis that Providence faces."" Providence Foundation leaders recently wrote an opinion piece calling for a ""feasible reuse"" of the building. ""The building presents an opportunity to create an asset for the community similar to public-private projects such as the Shepard/University of Rhode Island building, the Masonic Temple/Renaissance Hotel and South Street Landing,"" chairman William F. Hatfield and executive director Daniel A. Baudouin wrote. ""City and state leaders and the developer should come together in a public process in early 2016 to identify a creative and exciting solution for this iconic building. Like all historic restoration projects, this redevelopment will require state assistance."" Cliff Wood, the Providence Foundation's director of public advocacy, said, ""We are still reeling from other bad decisions in the past, but this one is a lot more solid, both literally and figuratively."" And having the state's tallest building out of commission ""smack in the middle of the capital, between City Hall and the federal building, is a symbolic as well as literal detriment to our goals,"" he said. In 2015, talk of Citizens Bank moving into the Superman building surfaced and faded. So does Sweetser have specific plans and requests that he plans to bring to the governor and legislative leaders in 2016? ""We will have those,"" he said, ""but we don't have those today."" He did mention Raimondo's Rebuild Rhode Island tax credit program  and the $15-million cap that the legislature placed on credits for any one project. ""We are enthused that the program was reinstituted,"" he said. ""The problem is it has a cap of $15 million. That's OK for the majority of buildings. It's unfortunately a constriction on a building this big."" While developers have walked away from other projects in Providence, Sweetser said, ""Let's say I walked away. Whoever comes in has the same challenge. Even if they get the building for zero, you cannot build for the uses given previously without subsidies. It has nothing to do with me. It has nothing to do with our plan. Period. Subsidies are a requirement for the building to go forward."" What about knocking the building down, as some have suggested? Fischer said, ""That is the wrong crane to bring in here. This building should be celebrated and its rehabilitation should be heralded. This is part of our history. It's been part of our skyline. You are never going to build another one like this."" From top to bottom, the building contains some unique features. For example, the basement houses a safe with a 17-ton steel door hanging from enormous hinges that holds some 5,000 safe-deposit boxes. And the penthouse level contains the ""Gondola Room,"" said to resemble the gondola of a dirigible, with cracked leather covering the doors, a built-in wooden wine rack standing empty and an oval window providing a bird's-eye view of the city. Speaking of birds, a nesting box for peregrine falcons can be seen from the windows of the 29th-level penthouse. And as 2015 came to a close, you could see that while they don't pay rent, these birds of prey are now the Superman building's only tenants. _EMAIL_ (401) 277-7368 On Twitter: @FitzProv",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2016/jan/17/david-sweetser/superman-developer-why-he-needs-subsidies/,Politics,Polifact
16111,Scott Walkers Blueprint for Americas Renewal Gets 10 Lines in the New York Times,"Scott Walkers Blueprint for Americas Renewal Gets 10 Lines in the New York Times RUSH: The New York Times. What is this, a tiny little paragraph? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 lines. National Briefing, Midwest. Its page A14 of the New York Times today. Heres the headline: Wisconsin: Assembly Passes Governors Tax-Cut Plan  The Wisconsin Assembly has passed Gov. Scott Walkers $504 million tax-cut plan. The chamber approved the bill on Tuesday by a vote of 61 to 35. It wasnt even close. The Senate passed it earlier this month. Assembly approval sends the bill on to Mr. Walker for his signature. The governor wants to use a portion of the states projected $977 million surplus to pay for cuts in property and income taxes. The solution to this countrys problems gets 10 lines in the New York Times. Im amazed they even ran the story, but it gets 10 lines. I think this is one of the biggest and most under-commented on, including in conservative media, stories this year. This is simply huge, what Governor Walker has done. No matter how you look at this, A, lets look at Wisconsin. One of the bluest of blue states. One of the bluest of the blue universities. One of the headquarter states for malcontent state unions. One of the headquarter states for malcontent Democrat Party union activism. They did everything they could not just to destroy Walkers political career; they tried to destroy his reputation and his political life. They attempted to recall him a couple of times. The Democrats in the Senate walked out. He persevered. He overcame. He dominated, and he won. And in the bluest of blue states unemployment is around 3.5%. The schools have been reformed and so the unions do not control every aspect of it now. There is a surplus of nearly a billion dollars in this economy. Theres no oil fracking going on there like there is next door in the Dakotas. There is a near $1 billion surplus and hes returning half of that to the residents of the state in the form of a property tax cut and income tax cut, and it rates 10 lines in the New York Times. Elsewhere across the country we have economic decay, frustration, unemployment, no job prospects, certainly no career prospects. Weve got the answer in practical and real political terms and real-life experience  and particularly for the Republican Party, the blueprint for how to win elections and the blueprint for how to govern after you win elections, the blueprint for economic revival, the blueprint for employment revival, the blueprint for budgetary solvency. Its amazing! It is a huge story. I interviewed Governor Walker for the Limbaugh Letter two issues ago, maybe the current issue. The upcoming interview, by the way, Bill Donohue, the Catholic League, and that is also fascinating. Youve got to read that. Youve got to read the upcoming issue of the Limbaugh Letter with Bill Donohue, the Catholic League. But this interview with Scott Walker in the preceding issue is just indescribably good. I just ask a couple questions and get out of the way. The Democrats are living in mortal fear that this is gonna be discovered. The Democrats are living in mortal fear that this is gonna be uncovered, discovered, massively, widely reported. Theyre living in mortal fear that the Republicans are gonna get their butts in gear and learn from this and try to replicate it. So far theres no sign of that. This is Paul Ryans state as well, and there are presidential rumblings for him. There are also presidential rumblings for Walker. I have no feeling on that. But, man, I was surprised to see this story in the New York Times. Just 10 lines as printed, and every important detail is there. Walker introduced a bill in January that would send $406 million to technical colleges to reduce their property tax hit and cut income taxes by $98 million by reducing the lowest bracket to 4% from 4.4%. So the poor are getting a tax cut. Everybody is, actually, cause property taxes are being cut. The end result would be a $131 reduction in a median homes tax bill this December and $46 in annual income tax savings for the average worker. I look at this, and I wonder why conservative media is not glomming onto this, and why the Republican Party isnt. But its worth paying a lot of attention to. By the way, Walker? When you listen to him talk, when you listen him campaign, he doesnt sound like any of these other Republican governors who wants to cross the aisle and work together and have bipartisanship. The Democrats didnt offer him any of that. The Democrats offered no cooperation whatsoever. All they offered was personal destruction. They threatened; they intimidated. They threatened harm against his family, these union people did, and he persevered. One of the reasons that so few people know about it is that hes not out beating his chest over all of this and trying to get people to look at him and then say, Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Hes just going about his business. I just want to take the occasion to congratulate him and to thank him again, by the way. Now, on the other side of this, whats the alternative? The alternative is what weve got going right now. The alternative is the Russians rebuilding the Soviet Union under Vladimir Putin, while Obama fills in his brackets for March Madness.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/apr/02/rush-limbaugh/wisconsin-heavily-democratic-state-and-yet-under-s/,Politics,Polifact
16273,"Georgia Legislature looks again at linking assistance, drug testing","An effort is once more under way in the Georgia Legislature to require drug tests for poor people who get government assistance, and to have them pay for the tests. The state two years ago passed such a law for all welfare recipients, but it ran into legal trouble. Now a Vidalia legislator facing a tough Republican primary has taken up the cause and would add a much bigger population for scrutiny: the states 1 million-plus food stamp recipients. Rep. Greg Morris hopes his revamped proposal will solve the legal problems of the 2012 welfare law, which was put on hold when a similar law in Florida was struck down over blanket searches. Under his bill, House Bill 772, the Department of Human Services couldnt demand a drug test of just any benefits applicant. Department workers would have to have a reason to suspect drug use by an individual: for example, if the applicant had previously applied for a job that also required drug testing; or his or her demeanor. Legislators who support the bill, which the House has already passed 107-66, said they saw no harm in drug-testing recipients of assistance when so many people have to be drug-tested for a job. A parade of charities, legal groups and other opponents of the bill, however, lined up at a Senate committee hearing Monday to call it cruel, ineffective, expensive and unconstitutional. Some complained about the vagueness of the demeanor provision and that DHS would not necessarily train workers to apply it. Only Morris testified in the bills favor, but it passed, on a party-line vote with the Republican chairwoman, Sen. Renee Unterman of Buford, intervening to break a tie. Morris said he understood why no one else spoke for his bill. What lobbyists are there for just the average worker whos a taxpayer? Morris said. Theyre economizing and buying inexpensive cuts of meat, when with (food stamps) you can buy lobster. Many food stamp users are workers. The less they make, the more food stamps they may receive, up to a maximum of $347 per month for a family of two with no income, according to DHS. In an interview, Morris called food stamps an out-of-control government program. He said its membership had exploded  not because of the recession, but because of lax eligibility standards  and should be reduced, perhaps by more than half. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, nine states, mostly in conservative areas, have passed drug-testing benefits legislation. Morris said during the hearing that he had worked to make sure the bill was not draconian. Anyone whose benefits are revoked can get them restored with a clean drug test after a certain period: one month on the first failed test, up to one year on the third failed test. Some people are exempt from testing, including people in nursing homes or people who DHS deems too handicapped to test. According to DHS, about 1.7 million Georgians receive food stamps (a program actually called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP), and 16,000 receive welfare (called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF). Many of those are children, who would not be drug-tested under the bill. A drug-testing program in Florida cost more to administer than it saved the state. But in Georgia, test-takers would pay the testing fee. I would submit to you that the vast amount of food stamp recipients can afford $17 to pay for the privilege of using the taxpayer-funded benefits, Morris said. Pass or fail, the recipient would pay the full cost of the test, unless that person qualified for Medicaid. Medicaid recipients would pay $17, or less if less was charged. Paradoxically, for the very poorest Georgians, the cost would probably be higher. In Georgia, because of a political standoff over Obamacare, people making less than the federal poverty level do not receive Medicaid. So they would pay full price. No child would have benefits revoked, Morris said. If a childs parents tested positive and lost their own benefits, they could designate a third person to spend their childs food stamps  under the assumption that the food purchased would all be given to the child. The bill still might cost the state. It contains a requirement that food stamp cards add a photo identifying the recipient, which opponents say could cost millions of dollars to add and was not funded in the bill. Morris said recipients might be required to pay the cost of the photo ID, too. Those potential costs, and the government intrusion into peoples lives, concerned Brett Bittner, the director of the Libertarian Party of Georgia. While we appreciate the idea of lessening the burden on the taxpayer, Bittner said, when you look at corporate subsidies and tax breaks and other takers of public money that arent going to be subject to this, it just seems like a way to punish those who are truly in need rather than actually trying to have a workable system. A similar program in Florida did find drug use among food stamp recipients. But the rate was lower than the rate among the population at large. Thats one piece of research cited in a 2013 federal court ruling that has halted drug-testing laws in Florida as well as Georgia. Its unclear whether that ruling, in the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, would also stop HB 772. The current laws are illegal because they dont meet the high standard for blanket searches without individualized suspicion, the ruling says. While HB 772 does take a crack at individualizing suspicion, the courts ruling also says that in most cases, the standard is met only with a judges warrant. This bill doesnt call for that. In addition, it would conflict with federal law, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture documents. Some opponents questioned why Georgia would join them when it might cost more than it saves and will certainly draw a court battle. Lee Burton has his own idea why. Hes biased. Burton, a Republican and a retired Navy SEAL, is challenging Morris for his seat. He claims Morris only championed the drug-testing idea after Burton opened his campaign in October, talking about making changes in welfare and social programs. And, Burton says, on the heavyweight issue where Morris was put in charge of  banking  he whiffed. Morris is chairman of the House Banks and Banking Committee, which oversees the states financial regulations and its bank regulators. In a state with the worst record of bank failures in the country since 2008, the committee has considered few bills that would stem the states rate of failing financial institutions. Morris says Burton is the one playing politics. If I was playing politics, Morris said, Id jump out and say, Im going to save the world as banking chairman. Weve heard legislation and were going to consider them in a businesslike way. Morris also indicated he wasnt worried about the primary. Ive been up here legislating, he said.

16335,"Sentencing reform already produced $20M savings, says Deal","ATLANTA | Gov. Nathan Deal told a University of Georgia alumni group this week that savings from his criminal sentencing reforms started almost immediately and now total $20 million per year. He also announced that hiring for most state jobs will no longer automatically eliminate ex-felons. They will at least get a personal interview. ""If you have a story to tell, you might have a shot at getting a job,"" he said, adding that he wants the state to serve as the test for private employers. Part of that money saved from the sentencing reforms has been earmarked in his proposed budget for pay raises and recruiting of prison guards. Part is also doubling what the state pays counties to house state inmates until the state finds one of its own cells for them. Speaking to graduates of UGA's School of Public and International Affairs at an Atlanta reception on Monday, the governor said he was surprised at the speed and size of the savings. ""I was amazed at the dollar figures ... and amazed at the time frame,"" he said. The reforms were implemented two years ago. They included reduced sentences for relatively minor crimes like writing bad checks and burglary as well as diverting addicts to community supervision and treatment through so-called accountability courts instead of the normal criminal system. Last year, Deal convinced the state Legislature to reform the juvenile justice system, gradually shifting responsibility to counties. He said he expects that to bring additional savings, but said it was too soon to know how much. This year, he is asking the Legislature for changes to help convicts scheduled for release be better prepared for life on the outside. One way is through improved education and job training while behind bars. He said a distance-learning program that has achieved recent successes for juvenile offenders can be adapted for adult prisons. He said he would be making what he called ""a major announcement"" soon about prison education. Despite the savings to taxpayers for the reforms, he said there are human benefits as well, such as reduced recidivism. ""We use big words like recidivism,"" Deal said.

16538,Cagle supports opt in on campus carry,"Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle said Wednesday he will support giving college leaders a say on whether students may carry guns on campus. With a new version of a controversial gun bill expected to be filed Friday, Cagle sat down with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution to talk about why he favors an opt in approach to guns, how quickly he wants to privatize parts of Georgias troubled foster care system and how to properly honor the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. On efforts to expand gun rights in Georgia: I have had a strong view of the protection of the Second Amendment and the right to bear arms. I dont really back away from that. I think its a fundamental right and were proud of our record. The two most controversial issues (in the gun proposal) are those of campus carry along with (allowing guns in) churches. Provided that there are the appropriate measures built around safety and the well-being and the concern of all, I could probably be comfortable with a campus carry approach. If an individual (such as a college or a church) wants to allow someone to be granted the right to carry under a concealed weapon permit, they should have that right. If they choose not to, then obviously the carry permit holder would have to respect that right. Theres discussion of the opt in or opt out provisions, and I think giving that school or that university or that church that ability is something that has some merit. On a push to privatize parts of Georgias foster care system: Were talking about kids who have nowhere else to turn but to foster care. We can do a better job. Were certainly not looking at a (complete) privatization, but I do think we are looking clearly at a public-private partnership that seeks out those vendors that have a strong mission and strong desire to protect kids. Were not going to prescribe a hard, ironclad type of approach. But what we are wanting to do is set up a basic framework and then give some discretion to the (state) agency. Its not going to be something that happens immediately. There are a number of steps that have to occur before we can really have something concrete in terms of implementation, but I do think that legislation needs to be put in place this year. On controversy over how to properly memorialize the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. at the state Capitol: We had the fortune of him being a Georgia native, and so I think it is important that we find ways that recognize him that are fitting. Hes the only person who has a portrait here in the Capitol in a designated position along with the other governors. A genuine and sincere conversation does need to be had. If I had to have a preference, I more than likely would support some type of monument as the most appropriate way to honor him thats fitting. Theres been a desire of many to look for a statue, and Im very open to that idea. On the return of Sen. Don Balfour, R-Snellville, after he was acquitted of filing false expense reports: Its been a high priority of mine to ensure in the Senate that we do rise above party politics. We had some controversy on the floor around Sen. Balfour, and the one person who came to his defense was the Dean of the Senate, whos a Democrat, Sen. Steve Thompson (of Marietta). The legal course has taken its action, and the Senate has also done various things and now its time to move on. Sen. Balfour is a good man, and is a man who can bring an awful lot of wisdom and knowledge to the debate in the Senate, so I look forward to what hes going to be able to do this session and future years.

Hank Johnson, Gov. Nathan Deal and Mayor Kasim Reed addressed the audience of hundreds. Dr. King deserves all the praise and honor that is afforded him in ceremonies like this one which take place each year around the nation, Deal said. But I think more than just saying kind thoughts about him, we ought to take action ourselves. This is how we embed truth into our words. Deal pledged to give King a permanent presence at the state Capitol, but stopped short of giving specific details. Reed praised the sacrifices King made that allowed men like him and President Barack Obama to run for office. I think in moments like this, weve got to come back to our core and remember how it all happened, he said. Reed pledged to improve Martin Luther King.

Shame on me and shame on all of usthat Martin Luther King Jr. Drive looks like every other Martin Luther King Jr. Drive in the United States of America, he said. The Rev. Raphael Warnock, Ebenezers senior pastor, spoke about healthcare and income inequality during his keynote address, saying federal leaders should extend unemployment insurance. The crowd stood as he called for Deal to expand Medicaid, though Deal had left the service by that time. There is no reason not to expand Medicaid, he said. It is ours, not for the taking. We gave the money. Let the money come back. Previous speakers include Cornel West, the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, and Martin Luther King III.

Chris Christie ended a campaign stop in Somers Point on Saturday with an argument with a public school teacher who showed up to protest his education policies. Melissa Tomlinson, a teacher at Buena Regional Middle School, said she asked the governor, Why are you portraying our schools as failure factories? He responded, What do you want?

Christie's spokeswoman, Maria Comella, disagrees with Tomlinson's characterization of the conversation. The governor did not say that he is ""tired of you people,"" Comella said. ""They were having a discussion about the (education) funding levels and the governor said that no matter how much money we spend, it will never be enough for you people,"" she said. The exchange was witnessed by a crowd of Christie supporters who had just listened to him give a campaign speech inside the VFW. The Republican governor faces Democrat Barbara Buono in Tuesdays election.

Tomlinson is part of the New Jersey chapter of the Badass Teachers Association, whose Facebook page says: This page was created to help us further our cause in the fight against the 'deform' of public education in the state of New Jersey. Christie cut more than $1 billion in state aid to schools in his first year in office. He has since touted his administrations attention to public schools. He supports expanding charter schools and instituting a voucher program called the Opportunity Scholarship Act, which would give students in low-performing money for tuition in private schools. I would be happy to take as many dollars as possible away from failure factories that send children on a no-stop route to prison and to failed dreams, if we could take that money and put it into a place where those families have hope,"" Christie said last month during a speech to the Orthodox Union in Teaneck. Christie recently asked Education Commissioner Christopher Cerf to look into how taxpayer dollars are spent at New Jerseys private schools for disabled students, responding to a recent Star-Ledger investigation. The newspapers review showed the schools  together a more than $600 million industry  are paid for by the public but can spend in ways public schools cannot, sometimes fueling nepotism, high salaries, fancy cars, generous pensions and questionable business deals.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2013/nov/10/chris-christie/chris-christie-tells-teacher-school-funding-highes/,Politics,Polifact
19180,Florida Democrats Ask HHS to Protect Floridians from High Insurance Premiums in Marketplace,"Florida Democrats Ask HHS to Protect Floridians from High Insurance Premiums in Marketplace f t # e Washington, DC, August 1, 2013 | (202-225-3001) In a letter sent today to U.S. Secretary Kathleen Sebelius led by Congressman Ted Deutch (FL-21), the Florida Democratic delegation in the House of Representatives slammed Governor Rick Scott and the Florida legislature for stripping the state of the authority to protect consumers from unreasonably high insurance premiums and called on the Department of Health and Human Services to take a more active role in reviewing rates in Florida. The Affordable Care Act encourages state regulators to review premium rates proposed by health insurance companies, but allows the federal government to engage in such reviews if a state is found to have inadequate protection for consumers. While the federal government determined in early May that Floridas Office of Insurance Regulation was legally capable of protecting consumers, on May 31, 2013 Governor Scott signed SB 1842 and explicitly forbid Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty from reviewing health insurance plans offered in the Marketplace for at least two years. In the letter, the Representatives write that the premium increases are not a coincidence, but rather the product of a cynical and intentional effort by Governor Scott and the Florida legislature to undermine the Affordable Care Act and make health insurance premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace more expensive by refusing to allow the Insurance Commissioner either to negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high. It is our hope that HHS will intervene on behalf of Florida consumers to ensure policies available on the Marketplace are fair and affordable. We believe HHS has the full authority under current law and federal regulations to undertake these actions. With two months remaining until the Marketplace is scheduled to open, we look forward to hearing from you regarding the actions the Department of Health and Human Services and CMS will take to protect Florida consumers  since Governor Scott, the Florida legislature, and Insurance Commissioner McCarty will not. Joining Rep. Deutch on the letter were Reps. Alcee L. Hastings, Corrine Brown, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Kathy Castor, Frederica S. Wilson, Joe Garcia, Alan Grayson, Lois Frankel, and Patrick E. Murphy. A text copy of the letter is available below. August 1, 2013 The Honorable Kathleen Sebelius Secretary U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 200 Independence Ave., SW Washington, DC 20201 RE: Florida Health Insurance Marketplace Premium Rates Dear Secretary Sebelius, It has become abundantly clear that a law enacted by Florida Governor Rick Scott and the state legislature could leave consumers vulnerable to unreasonably high premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace. Therefore, we write you to ask for your assurance that the Department of Health and Human Services will exercise its authority to protect consumers in our State. As you well know, the Affordable Care Act encourages state regulators to protect consumers from unreasonably high insurance premiums, in a process known as Rate Review. The law ensures that if states do not have an adequate Rate Review system in place, the federal government may step in to protect consumers from unjustifiable premiums. The time to step in is now. As of May 3, 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) determined that Floridas Office of Insurance Regulation operated an Effective Rate Review Program. Led by a state Insurance Commissioner, this office has long been charged by Florida law to review proposed insurance rates. Unfortunately, it appears that Florida Governor Rick Scott and the state legislature waited until CMS finalized this determination before passing a law to strip the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation of its authority to review insurance premiums and protect consumers. Signed into law on May 31st, 2013, Senate Bill 1842 forbids Floridas Insurance Commissioner from reviewing health insurance plans offered on the new Marketplace on behalf of Florida consumers for at least two years. In our view, the passage of this law invalidates CMSs determination that Florida had an effective Rate Review Program and thus necessitates that the federal government take up an expanded role in Florida to protect consumers. Indeed in other states, like Maryland that released its rates last week, where state insurance commissioners have Rate Review and full negotiating power, health insurance premiums are substantially lower. Over 3.9 million people in Florida are uninsured, and the availability of affordable coverage on Floridas new Marketplace will be vital to expanding coverage. This week, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty indicated that premiums for the plans that will be offered this October will increase between 30 and 40 percent in the individual market, and 5 to 20 percent in the small-group market. This is not a coincidence, but rather the product of a cynical and intentional effort by Governor Scott and the Florida legislature to undermine the Affordable Care Act and make health insurance premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace more expensive by refusing to allow the Insurance Commissioner either to negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high. Florida legislators also directed the Office of Insurance Regulation to ignore the significant tax credits for Floridians that will make health insurance even more affordable. While other states have reported great success in driving down premium rates proposed by insurance companies seeking to sell policies on their Marketplaces, officials in Florida have proactively abdicated any responsibility to protect consumers. The actions taken by Governor Scott and the legislature have made consumers vulnerable to the will of insurance companies, and it is time for the federal government to step in. The Affordable Care Act provides important consumer protections and protects Americans from unreasonable health insurance premiums. It is our hope that HHS will intervene on behalf of Florida consumers to ensure policies available on the Marketplace are fair and affordable. We believe HHS has the full authority under current law and federal regulations to undertake these actions. With two months remaining until the Marketplace is scheduled to open, we look forward to hearing from you regarding the actions the Department of Health and Human Services and CMS will take to protect Florida consumers  since Governor Scott, the Florida legislature, and Insurance Commissioner McCarty will not. Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter. f t # e Related News Deutch, Nelson, FL Dems Call on Gov.

20940,FL Dems: Rick Scott State of the State Nothing More than a State of Denial,"News FL Dems: Rick Scott State of the State Nothing More than a State of Denial FL Dems: Rick Scott State of the State Nothing More than a State of Denial Chair Tant Joins Dem State Legislators to Highlight Scotts Record of Putting Corporations Ahead of Florida's Middle Class Families TALLAHASSEE, FL  Today, ahead of Gov. Rick Scotts State of the State address, Florida Democratic Party Chairwoman Allison Tant joined by Senators Darren Soto and Dwight Bullard along with Representatives Mark Pafford and Karen Castor Dentel gathered outside of the Governors office to discuss his record of putting big corporations and special interests ahead of Florida's middle class families. The press conference followed the release of a memo today outlining the Governor's State of Denial about his failed record. At the press conference Chairwoman Allison Tant underscored Floridians aren't buying Scott's new poll-tested rhetoric which does not match his record: ""After cutting more jobs than he created in Florida in 2012, failing to keep his promise to create 700,000 new jobs and a disastrous election year where the Florida GOP got their teeth kicked in, Gov. Rick Scott is running away from everything he campaigned on to get reelected. Thanks for the sudden interest in Floridas families, Governor. But your State of the State is nothing more than a State of Denial about your record of putting corporations and special interests ahead of middle class families -- and nobody is buying it."" We need to get our economy back on track for these families, but cutting our way to prosperity is just another part of Scotts State of Denial, said Sen. Darren Soto. Speaking about the lack of leadership from Rick Scott for Floridas economy, Soto said that no amount of election year about-faces on teacher pay and Medicaid expansion will convince Floridians that the Governor has their interests in mind. Teachers Senator Dwight Bullard and Representative Karen Castor Dentel spoke on the effects of Rick Scotts failed record on Floridas schools. We know his record, said Castor Dentel. ""If he wants to create jobs and improve Floridas economy he must start by properly funding our schools instead of giving tax breaks to big corporations at the expense of Floridas students. We need a lasting and substantial commitment to public education, not a soundbite, said Bullard. Rick Scott thinks he can just flip a switch and undo all of the harm he has done Well Governor, you need to walk the walk. Representative Mark Pafford said: what makes these cuts so much worse is that this money isnt going back to the taxpayers or into other state projects; its being given away to corporations and special interests with no accountability. He went on to charge that Floridas Families deserve better then Rick Scotts State of Denial, and we plan on holding him accountable for his failed policies.""

20977,Full text: Eric Cantors Make Life Work speech,"Today, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor delivered remarks at the American Enterprise Institute ""outlining a number of major policy initiatives designed to 'Make Life Work' for more people."" Cantors speech, as prepared for delivery, appears below. Wonkblog will have more analysis of the policies shortly. In Washington, over the past few weeks and months, our attention has been on cliffs, debt ceilings and budgets, on deadlines and negotiations. All of this is very important, as there is no substitute for getting our fiscal house in order. There is no greater moral imperative than to reduce the mountain of debt facing us, our children and theirs. The House Republican Majority stands ready for President Obama and his party to finally join us in our efforts to tackle the big problems facing America. But today, I'd like to focus our attention on what lies beyond these fiscal debates. Over the next two years, the House majority will pursue an agenda based on a shared vision of creating the conditions for health, happiness and prosperity for more Americans and their families. And to restrain Washington from interfering in those pursuits. We will advance proposals aimed at producing results in areas like education, health care, innovation and job growth. Our solutions will be based on the conservative principles of self-reliance, faith in the individual, trust in the family and accountability in government. Our goal  to ensure every American has a fair shot at earning their success and achieving their dreams. It is my hope that I can stand before you in two years and report back that our side, as well as the president's, found within us the ability to set differences aside, to provide relief to so many millions of Americans who simply want their life to work again. In so many countries throughout history, children were largely consigned to the same station in life as their parents. But not here. In America, the son of a shoe salesman can grow up to be president. In America, the daughter of a poor single mother can grow up to own her own television network. In America, the grandson of poor immigrants who fled religious persecution in Russia can become the Majority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives. In America, in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, two bicycle shop mechanics gave mankind the gift of flight. The Wright brothers flew only 22 feet, 18 feet in the air, but they performed a miracle. As a result, only 66 years later, this great country of ours put a man on the moon and brought him back. We can do an enormous amount. Thats who we are. The Wright brothers father, Milton, first inspired his sons with a toy helicopter. But he never wanted Orville and Wilbur to fly together, for fear he would lose them both. In 1910, seven years after the boys first flight, Milton gave them permission to fly together, the only time they ever did, and it lasted six minutes. Later that day, Orville took 82-year-old Milton on the only flight of his life. It lasted seven minutes, rising 350 feet, while his elderly father shouted: Higher, Orville, higher. What a great commentary. In America, we do have higher expectations for our nation. Since our founding, we believed we could be the best hope to mankind. That hope led generations of immigrants to risk everything, to endure a tough journey to our shores, looking for a better future. The driving motivation for millions of immigrants passing by Lady Liberty in New York Harbor was the generation that came after them. And because of that hope  those high expectations  coupled with a determination to see them come true, every generation since has had it better off than the one before. Until now. Lately, it has become all too common in our country to hear parents fear whether their children will indeed have it better than they have. And for all of us parents, that is a scary thought. Let's face it. It has gotten a lot tougher to raise a family here in America. Our goal should be to eliminate this doubt gripping our nations families, and to restore their hope and confidence so that parents can once again see a better tomorrow for their children. Together, my wife Diana and I raised our three children, Evan, Jenna and Mikey, and we couldn't be more proud of the young adults they have become. Our nest is now empty, but I understand the pressure all parents are under, and the trying times they go through. Parents working, saving for school, paying for braces, helping with homework and going from one after-school activity to the next. It's not easy. That's why we worry so much. Where can you find an affordable home in a good neighborhood to raise your kids? Which health-care plan can I afford that allows you to see your doctors? Will the children make it through high school and get into a college of their choice, and if so, can you afford it? What about a career? Will that be available to them? These are real-life concerns. This is what keeps parents awake at night fearful that life won't work out the way they hoped. During the last several years with the stagnant economy, too many mothers and fathers have had to come home, walk into the kitchen and tell their families they didnt have a job anymore. How does a family like that save for a rainy day, when it just got tough to even make it through the next month? These families are desperate to wake up in the morning and have the nightmare over. The best way to restore their hope for the future and to heal our country is by making opportunity a reality for them and everyone. This comes with a growing economy, business expansion and start-ups creating jobs. Just like parents, Washington must start showing care for the generations ahead while leaving the parenting to the parents. Government policy should aim to strike a balance between what is needed to advance the next generation, what we can afford, what is a federal responsibility and what is necessary to ensure our children are safe, healthy and able to reach their dreams. Opportunity and the belief in a better tomorrow start with an education system that works. In an 1822 letter, Thomas Jefferson wrote: I look to the diffusion of light and education as the resource to be relied on for ameliorating the condition, promoting the virtue, and advancing the happiness of man."" With an eye toward Mr. Jeffersons vision, since 1965, the federal government has poured hundreds of billions of dollars into improving schools in low-income areas  over $15 billion just last year. And frankly, the results have not matched the investment. Joining us here today is Joseph Kelley and his family. A heroic Dad, Joseph worried that the public school wasnt helping his son. Rashawn flunked the first grade, and by fifth grade was three years behind on most subjects. The school actually put him in special education classes. Joseph would try and sit in on classes in order to help Rashawn, but was met with hostility, and even had to obtain a court order so Rashawn could have a tutor. Violence was so prevalent in Rashawns schools that eight D.C. police officers patrolled it on a daily basis. Mr. Kelly heard of the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program and dedicated himself to making sure Rashawn and his three sisters could gain access to a school that would put them on a path to graduation, and college  an opportunity he himself did not have. Within two years at a private school, Rashawn caught up to his classmates, and is now a student at the University of the District of Columbia. And his sisters, Domonique, Shakeyta and Rhunetta, are attending the Preparatory School of D.C. and are on a similar path to opportunity. I visited this school yesterday, and it is impressive. The kids are in a safe environment, with great teachers, terrific administrators, small class sizes and a mission that every kid succeeds. No one should deny Rashawn and his sisters this opportunity. Joseph Kelley, nor any parent, should have to wait for failing school systems to get their acts together. Throughout the country there are promising signs that we can bring schools and parents together to improve our educational system. San Francisco public schools adopted a funding mechanism according to whats termed a ""weighted student formula."" Under this policy, the more students a school attracts, the more money that school, its administrators and teachers receive. Low-income students are weighted heavier in the funding formula, as are children with disabilities, and those learning English as a second language. So, there's incentive for schools to seek the more vulnerable population, and reasons for schools to differentiate themselves and excel. Imagine if we were to try and move in this direction with federal funding. Allow the money we currently spend to actually follow individual children. Students, including those without a lot of money or those with special needs, would be able to access the best available school, not just the failing school they are assigned to. And their options ought to include not just public schools or private schools, but also charter schools. A competitive environment, where schools compete for students rather than the other way around, gives every child from the inner city of Washington to the streets of Los Angeles, an equal chance at a greater destiny. One of our priorities this year will be to move heaven and earth to fix our education system for the most vulnerable. And when those children graduate from high school, we must expand their choices and college should be a viable option. In 1980, the average cost of college was roughly $8,000 a year. Today, it is over $20,000, and less than 60 percent of the students who enroll in a four-year program graduate within six years. Clearly, something is broken. According to President Obamas former jobs council, by 2020 there will be 1.5 million jobs without the college graduates to fill them. While there is a persistent unmet demand of 400,000 to 500,000 job openings in the health-care sector alone. Recent reports indicate there are not enough applicants with the skills necessary to fill the jobs in the booming natural gas industry in America. Suppose colleges provided prospective students with reliable information on the unemployment rate and potential earnings by major. What if parents had access to clear and understandable breakdowns between academic studies and amenities? Armed with this knowledge, families and students could make better decisions about where to go to school, and how to budget their tuition dollars. Students would actually have a better chance of graduating within four years and getting a job. Helping students realize opportunity and a career, while keeping tuition costs low, makes common sense. Senators Rubio and Wyden have a proposal that they unveiled here at AEI, which addresses this goal. I look forward to working with them and Chairman John Kline in pursuing legislative action in the House. Over the course of this Congress, we will also work to reform our student aid process to give students a financial incentive to finish their studies sooner. We will encourage entrepreneurship in higher education, including for-profit schools. And we will fix the way we subsidize education by making the costs more transparent to parents, students and the millions of taxpayers who help pay some of the bill. We owe it to them. A good education leads to more innovation. Throughout our history, American colleges and universities have served as the crucible for the world's innovation. They are a big part of why the United States remains the destination for the world's best and brightest. Investment in education leads to innovation, which leads to more opportunity and jobs for all. Our problem? The investment we make is not yielding maximum returns. Each year our colleges and universities graduate approximately 40,000 foreign nationals with Masters and PhDs, many of whom are then forced to leave the country because there are not enough visa slots in our immigration system to permit them to stay. So rather than being able to invent things here in America, grow businesses or start one on their own, they do all of those things somewhere else. Fiona Zhou is here today. She is earning her masters degree at the George Washington University School of Engineering and Applied Science. Originally from China, shes been in the U.S. for five years, studying operations research in the systems engineering department. Shes pretty smart. She would like to stay here and invest her talents in America, and maybe even start her own company. But she has seen too many of her friends with advanced degrees have to go back home despite sharing her same dreams and aspirations. Last year, the House passed the bipartisan STEM Jobs Act which helped fix this problem. We will act again in this Congress, and we hope the Senate chooses to join us this time. I look forward to Fiona realizing her dreams and our country reaping the rewards of her hard work and talent. Whether its college or the cost of day care, making life work for more families means reducing the economic insecurity plaguing so many working moms and dads. Over the last 20 years, the world has changed. It used to be that one could make a career out of working for one company. Today, the average worker stays at his or her job for barely four years. Median income in 2010 was about the same as it was in 1997. Experts correctly point out that this statistic ignores that many working families are getting more benefits like health care from their employer and not just wages. But, explaining that rising health-care costs are depressing take-home pay is little consolation to a working mom. Her grocery bills are higher, her kids' school needs are more expensive, rent is up  and now, she's just trying to get by. And getting by is not the American Dream. As job markets are changing, more skills training and education are needed. Federal jobs training programs ought to make it easier for Americans who are out of work or who are changing careers to get the skills they need. Yet today, the federal government has a patchwork of over 47 different overlapping programs that are not dynamic or innovative enough to meet the needs of employers or potential employees. We can fix this, and we should be able to muster bipartisan support to do so. If you're a working parent, you know theres hardly ever enough time at home to be with the kids. Too many parents have to weigh whether they can afford to miss work even for half a day to see their child off on the first day of school or attend a parent-teacher conference. Federal laws dating back to the 1930s make it harder for parents who hold hourly jobs to balance the demands of work and home. An hourly employee cannot convert previous overtime into future comp-time or flex-time. In 1985, Congress passed a law that gave state and municipal employees this flexibility, but today still denies that same privilege to the entire private sector. Thats not right. Theres a police officer at home in my district, her name is Vicki. She is working a tough job, with long hours, while raising her children. Her life is made a little easier because as a local government employee, she is permitted to work some extra hours and save it up for a sick day or a school event. Imagine if we simply chose to give all employees and employers this option. A working mom could work overtime this month and use it as time off next month without having to worry about whether she'll be able to take home enough money to pay the rent. This is the kind of common sense legislation that should be non-controversial and moves us in the right direction to help make life work for families. Another step we have to take is on taxes. There is a lot of talk about taxes in Washington right now. For most families, tax preparation is hard and it is time consuming  this time of year especially. Think about what theyre going through. What tax form are you supposed to fill out, is it more beneficial to file jointly as a married couple or separately? Is a truck or gas mileage deductible or are you forgetting something that the IRS gives you credit for? In 1935, the Form 1040 was accompanied by a two-page instruction booklet. Today, taxpayers must wade through over 100 total pages of instructions. Just filling out a W-4 at a new job is confusing. You shouldnt need a worksheet to know how many dependents you have. Chairman Dave Camp and his committee are already underway in the effort to responsibly rewrite our nation's tax laws. As in education policy, health care and all else, tax reform, should reflect the priorities of working families and the future they're trying to shape for their kids. If nothing else, we must stop putting special interests ahead of our working families best interests. Loopholes and gimmicks benefitting those who've come to know how to work the system in Washington, are no more defensible than the path of wasteful and irresponsible spending we've been on for decades. Working families should come first. Everyone agrees a fairer, simpler tax code would give us all more time. In our attempt to make the tax code simpler, we must continue to demonstrate support for young parents who invest in having kids and raising a family. They are America's most valued investors. In 1997, a Republican Congress created the child tax credit specifically to help ease the financial burden of families raising children. In 2001, it was expanded. Such a policy helps to limit the size of government and results in fewer Americans looking to the government for support. Leading up to April 15th, families will be besieged by concerns over their taxes. But its health care and a concern for a healthy family that always worry parents most. Most Americans have come to expect the best health care in the world. But theres no doubt our current system is too expensive and too complicated. President Obamas health-care law resulted in higher premiums and costs for families, and has made access to quality health care and innovation tougher. If we want to reverse this trend, we should start by choosing to repeal the new taxes that are increasing the costs of health care and health insurance, like the medical device tax. With us today is Erin Shucosky. Erin has been a clinical nurse for 30 years in Baltimore. She spent the past ten years coordinating the research on a study to approve new replacement discs to treat patients suffering from crippling neck and back pain. Over time, Erin discovered she suffered from the very condition her work aimed to treat. On her days off, Erin would spend time at her daughters lacrosse tournaments barely able to move, and would then go home and spend most of her time there with an ice pack on her neck. So she went in for surgery and got those new disc replacements. Erins in a cervical collar today, but thankfully shes on the mend. The new medical device tax in ObamaCare makes it harder for researchers to develop these innovative devices in the U.S. and thus makes it harder for patients like Erin to get the care they need. ObamaCare has unnecessarily raised the costs of our health care. Even those who have pre-existing conditions could get the coverage they need without a trillion dollar government program costing us all more. And thats only the tip of the iceberg when we talk about health-care reform. Many families, like mine, are dealing with the challenges presented by aging and very sick parents. They rely on Medicare for relief. In 1965 the federal government created Medicare modeled after the standard Blue-Cross Blue Shield insurance plan commonly available at that time. In the past 50 years both health care and health insurance have changed dramatically, but the government and Medicare have not kept pace. Medicaid isnt doing any better. Under the Medicaid system the rules are set in Washington, but much of the bills are paid in our state capitals. Collectively states are spending more on Medicaid than they do on K-12 education. And states dont have the flexibility to innovate in order to lower costs and provide better care. As a result, in many cases, patients have been swallowed up by the system, and have become an afterthought. These programs are broken, and many patients are going without proper care. That's not fair to the people who depend on these programs. Weve got to fix them. We can modernize Medicare so it isnt so complicated for seniors or health-care providers and make it easier for them to get the care they need in a cost effective manner. We should begin by ending the arbitrary division between Part A, the hospital program, and Part B, the doctor services. We can create reasonable and predictable levels of out-of-pocket expenses without forcing seniors to rely on Medigap plans. Seniors who choose to receive their health-care treatment through a group of doctors and hospitals working together to control costs, should share in the savings through lower Medicare premiums and out of pocket costs. This is both cost effective and good for seniors. We can provide states more flexibility with respect to Medicaid that will allow them to provide better care for low-income families in a way that ultimately lowers costs. Options for states should include streamlining the process for determining eligibility, and allowing them to offer health coverage through patient-directed health care or flexible benefit programs. And we must make it faster and simpler for states to gain approval of federal waivers to modify their Medicaid programs. Long term, controlling health-care costs will require smarter federal investments in medical research. Many of todays cures and life saving treatments are a result of an initial federal investment. And much of it is spent on cancer research and other grave illnesses. One of the most courageous people I know is a young girl from Richmond named Katie. Ive known Katie for many years. Katie was diagnosed with a brain tumor just after her first birthday. This is every parents worst nightmare. For years, she went through different treatments and therapies with little success. At age 7, she and her parents headed to St. Jude Childrens Hospital in Memphis. She had a positive radiation treatment and is doing well today, but this month she will again travel back to St. Jude as she often does. Katie became a part of my congressional offices family and even interned with us. We rooted for her, and prayed for her. Today, she is a bright 12-year-old that is making her own life work despite ongoing challenges. Katie is down here in the front row. Katie, thank you for being here with us. Prayers for Katies recovery help. But we also must pray that scientists and researchers find cures to these diseases so our parents and grandparents dont leave us too soon, or that children like Katie are not robbed of a healthy life. There is an appropriate and necessary role for the federal government to ensure funding for basic medical research. Doing all we can to facilitate medical breakthroughs for people like Katie should be a priority. We can and must do better. This includes cutting unnecessary red tape in order to speed up the availability of life saving drugs and treatments and reprioritizing existing federal research spending. Funds currently spent by the government on social science  including on politics of all things  would be better spent helping find cures to diseases. Scientific breakthroughs are the result of and have helped contribute to America's being the worlds capital of innovation and opportunity in nearly every field. For this and many other reasons, people across the globe want to become a part of our country. We must never diminish that desire, or worse, become a place that is no longer desirable. It's no secret that there are more than 11 million people here illegally, many of whom have become part of the fabric of our country. They, like us, have families and dreams. While we are a nation that allows anyone to start anew, we are also a nation of laws, and thats what makes tackling the issue of immigration reform so difficult. In looking to solve this problem soon, we must balance respect for the rule of law and respect for those waiting to enter this country legally, with care for the people and families, most of whom just want to make a better life, and contribute to America. A good place to start is with the kids. One of the great founding principles of our country was that children would not be punished for the mistakes of their parents. It is time to provide an opportunity for legal residence and citizenship for those who were brought to this country as children and who know no other home. Im pleased that many of my colleagues in both chambers of Congress on both sides of the aisle have begun work in good faith to address these issues. And Im pleased these discussions make border security, employment verification and creating a workable guest worker program an immediate priority. Its the right thing to do for our families, for our security, and for our economy. There are some who would rather avoid fixing the problem in order to save this as a political issue. I reject this notion and call on the president to help lead us towards a bipartisan solution rather than encourage the common political divisions of the past. A sonnet by Emma Lazarus, The New Colossus, was placed at the Statue of Liberty in 1903. Parts of it read: Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand A mighty woman with a torchFrom her beacon-hand Glows world-wide welcomeI lift my lamp beside the golden door! The message of this sonnet should sound familiar to most of us. The image of the Statue of Liberty blended with the stories of our immigrant past serve as humble reminders of who we are as a country. It's the reason I'm able to stand here before you. Like so many of their generation living in Eastern Europe at the turn of the last century, my grandparents fled the vicious anti-Semitic programs of the czars of Russia to come to America. Widowed at a young age, my grandmother raised her two sons in a tiny apartment atop a grocery store she and my grandfather had opened. With little but her faith, thrift and hope for a better tomorrow, my grandma worked seven days a week to ensure my dad and uncle could realize the promise of this great country. And today, my children and I stand as proof of the possibility to what may have seemed to her like an impossible dream. To uphold this legacy of those whove come before us, Washington will need to make choices. And in a divided government, these choices are often tough. We in the House Majority remain committed to making those tough choices and stand ready to lead with this president. ""Higher""  Milton Wright once shouted from the air. Higher. Making life work for more working people, and all who want to work, is the best way to a future of higher growth and more opportunity.

Our constitution defines some of the things we shall do, as well as some of the things we shall not do. Between those goal posts of shall and shall not lies the field on which we play. It is not a Field of Dreams but a Field of Law. Like spectators in the stands of a great stadium, a cacophony of voices will tell you what play to run and agree or disagree with your performance. Just remember, we are all on the same team with you, and we share a common purpose of making Georgia the best place to work, play, get an education and raise a family. Last year, I told you that I had a goal: To fulfill the truest purposes of government  the ones for which Georgians need their government most  and then get out of the way so that they can live their lives in freedom and as they see fit. So far, I believe we have done that well. We have made communities safer, improved educational opportunities, provided for infrastructure improvements, driven workforce development, generated a better business environment and created jobs. Together, we have implemented innovative tax reform that incentivizes business growth, passed smart-on-crime criminal justice reform and saved HOPE. This year, I challenge you to join me as we go forward with a focus on progress. While times have been tough and we have had to make difficult choices, I will not lead our state with a Doomsday mindset, reacting erratically and hastily based on fear or ignorance. Instead, we will move forward with confidence, focusing on the proven foundations of a growing Georgia, those that keep us steady during times of uncertainty but also during times of prosperity; foremost among these are public safety, education, healthcare and economic development Just as Georgia is too big and too important to fall prey to Doomsayers pessimism, it is also too big and too important to be divided by race, geography or ideology. This year, lets concentrate on the things on which we can all agree: The foundations that improve the lives of our citizens and undergird the bright horizons of tomorrow. In the first foundation, Public Safety, lets capitalize on the success that we have already had in criminal justice reform, in which, last year, we crafted legislation that saves both lives and taxpayer dollars. Through increased use of accountability courts  drug, DUI, mental health and veteran courts  along with other measures, this state will avoid the need to add 5,000 prison beds over five years and save taxpayers at least $264 million; these measures simultaneously decrease the number of offenders who end up back in jail after being released  and create productive, taxpaying citizens rather than more dangerous criminals. And we have continued funding for accountability courts by allocating $11.6 million toward that purpose in my budget proposal. This year we will continue our work by bringing legislation designed to produce better results with juvenile offenders and divert them from the adult system. I want to thank the Special Council on Criminal Justice Reform for Georgians for their hard work over the past two years. I urge your strong consideration of their recommendations for the Juvenile Justice system. Similar to last year, we would emphasize community-based, non-confinement correctional methods for low-risk offenders as an alternative to regional and state youth centers. To get started, I will be requesting $5 million in the FY 2014 budget to create an incentive funding program that encourages communities to create and utilize these community-based options. These options range from substance abuse treatment to family counseling and provide judges with viable, alternative sentencing options. Just as with last year, we stand to lower recidivism and save taxpayer dollars. For example, are you aware that the cost of each bed in a Youth Detention Center is in excess of $91,000 each year? It is certainly an area where less costly options must be used. Together, we can continue to improve our states justice systems while keeping our citizens safe by reserving our prison beds for violent offenders. This year provides another opportunity to bolster public safety. This past summer, Georgia witnessed several tragic accidents on our waterways. We know alcohol is involved in over 50 percent of all boating fatalities each year. On Georgias roads, if the operator of a vehicle has a Blood Alcohol content of .08 or higher, he can be charged with Driving Under the Influence. However, you cannot be charged with Boating Under the Influence unless your Blood Alcohol level is .10 or higher. The Jake and Griffin Prince BUI Law that I am proposing will change that. If you are too drunk to drive an automobile, you are too drunk to drive a boat! I will also propose, through the Kile Glover Boat Education Law, that you place age limits and educational requirements on young operators of boats and personal watercraft and that children who are 13 or younger must wear life jackets when riding in an open boat that is moving. Another foundation block for growing a more prosperous Georgia is education. Since we are talking about foundations, lets talk about our earliest learners, who build upon what they learn today for the rest of their lives. We have an outstanding pre-K program that has been nationally recognized. This past year, the National Institute for Early Education Research awarded Georgia its first 10 out of 10 in measures of quality; we were one of only five states to receive such a designation. In the budget for FY 2014, I have added 10 days to the pre-K school year, thereby restoring it to a full 180 days and increasing the salaries of deserving teachers. Last year, we focused on literacy by designating $1.6M to establish a reading mentors program that was designed to grow the percentage of Georgias children who are reading on grade level by the third grade. Early indicators are proving it a good investment. We must not let our children fall behind, for that is a path toward remediation and delayed success. As such, I have included $1.6 million in this years budget to continue the reading mentor program. While most state agencies have seen their budgets for the remainder of this fiscal year and for the FY2014 reduced by an average of 3 percent, K-12 education was not subject to these reductions. In fact, the budget will give $156M in additional funding for enrollment growth in K-12 schools in FY2013. For next year, there will be $147 million for enrollment growth and salary increases for teachers based on training and experience. There is also an additional $41 million to fully fund the revised Equalization formulas adopted last year. We must continue to make K-12 education a top priority, because Georgia recently ranked 45th out of the 47 states that reported graduation rates under the cohort method. This is unacceptable! We can do better! We will do better! The people of Georgia spoke loud and clear when they adopted the Constitutional Amendment on Charter Schools by an overwhelming margin. The message they sent was this  They are not satisfied with the status quo! And neither am I! We have been funding public education under the Quality Basic Education legislation, QBE. This is a 1985 formula that does not meet the needs of a 21st century classroom. While adjustments have been made, as recently as last year, more needs to be done. As we finalize the pilot projects and reforms being produced by our Race To The Top initiative, I look forward to modernizing the way we spend tax payer dollars so that we can produce more positive results in our public schools. Public distrust emanates from poor graduation rates, excessive remediation expenses and substandard test scores. Dedicated educators deserve to have this stigma removed. If we dont do that, we will discourage the bright college students who want to be teachers from choosing that profession. We cannot afford that loss! Georgia has had too many school boards placed under the sanctions of potential loss of accreditation. While this is a very serious matter, it is somewhat ironic that the loss of accreditation can only be based on governance issues and not on substandard academic progress of the school system. Unless this is addressed by state legislation, we will continue to have thousands of Georgias children trapped in underperforming schools through no fault of their own. I look forward to working with you to solve this problem. In education, as in most areas of life, poor outcomes are most often not the result of lack of money, but lack of vision and leadership. One of the primary reasons for getting an education is to get a job. To the parents of children who contemplate dropping out of school, you should remind them that they are condemning themselves to the lowest rung on the employment ladder, and you should prepare them to continue to live at home because the jobs that will be available to them will be few indeed. Since employment is a primary goal of education, I want to commend the Chancellor of our University System and the Commissioner of our Technical College System for evaluating and refocusing their programs of study to give priority to those educational paths that have a proven record of employability. It is a tragedy when a young person works hard, accumulates debt for student loans and then graduates with a diploma in a field where there are no jobs. My budget proposes to focus more funds within our HOPE Grant Program toward occupations where we know jobs are available and shortages actually exist. Currently, there are several thousand jobs available for individuals with a commercial drivers license. There are similar shortages in the areas of nursing and early childhood education. In order to fill these vacancies we suggest directing additional funds within our Technical College HOPE Grants so that over 90 percent of the tuition costs in these programs will be provided. Thats Putting Your Money Where The Jobs Are! Two years ago, we worked together to save our HOPE Scholarship program. As a result, it remains one of the most generous state run scholarship programs in the nation. It is also keeping our best and brightest students in Georgia. In FY2011, more than 97 percent of entering in-state freshman at both the University of Georgia and Georgia Tech received the Hope Scholarship. Today, I am happy to say that my budget will increase the Hope Scholarship by 3 percent over last year, bringing the total funds going to Hope in FY 2014 to nearly $600 million. This is quite a contrast to the proposed bankruptcy of HOPE that was projected to occur this year. Thats why I say, together, we saved HOPE! Also, in keeping with our emphasis on results based funding, I would like to thank the Higher Education Funding Commission for its hard work over the past year to provide us with a solid recommendation that will be the starting point for change from enrollment-based funding to outcomes-based funding in our university and technical colleges. I encourage you to join me in fully considering their recommendations. Another foundation block for a growing and prosperous Georgia is healthcare. I want to thank the Commissioner of Agriculture and the Commissioner of the Department of Public Health for their efforts to keep our citizens healthy and thereby minimize the need for expensive healthcare. Commissioner Black has launched the Georgia Grown program in which he is promoting agricultural products grown in our state. He is working with local farmers and school dieticians to increase the consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables by our school children. Commissioner Fitzgerald is one of the individuals leading the Georgia SHAPE program, which is educating and encouraging children regarding the importance of exercise. Both of these efforts will keep young people healthier and will reduce the scourge of obesity that abounds in our state. As a result of a downturned economy and the provisions of federal legislation known as Obamacare, we are seeing a growth in our Medicaid rolls. As you know, I have elected not to expand our eligibility limits for Medicaid. At the State Chamber of Commerce Eggs and Issues Breakfast yesterday, I elaborated upon the reasons for that decision. I did not judge it prudent to expand the eligible population of an entitlement program by adding an additional 620,000 new enrollees since our state is already spending approximately $2.5 billion in state taxpayer funds annually. Even without expanding the eligible population base, we expect our Medicaid rolls to grow by an additional 100,000 individuals. This new population of Medicaid recipients, along with other mandates of Obamacare such as the extension of the time between the review of eligibility, will raise our Medicaid costs by nearly $1.7 billion over the next 10 years. For FY 2014, I am requesting that you authorize the Board of Community Health to apply a provider fee for hospitals, just as they currently do for nursing homes. Unless this is done, there will be a shortfall in revenue to support the Medicaid program of nearly $700M. Since we cannot adjust benefits, the reduction in reimbursements to hospitals would be the only way to keep the program solvent. Those reductions would be approximately 20 percent, which would seriously jeopardize many of our states hospitals. Therefore, I urge your favorable consideration of this legislation. Last year, we appropriated $1.2M to expand residency programs for doctors in our state. I want to thank Dr. Ricardo Azziz, the President of Georgia Regents University Augusta, for leading this effort and the participating hospitals for making it possible for us to develop 400 new residency slots. We believe this is one of the best ways to retain medical doctors in our state. And the FY 2014 budget includes $2M in additional funds to further increase the number of health professionals practicing in the state. The last foundation block for a prosperous Georgia that I will address today is economic development. For the last 2 years during this State of the State Address you have heard me say, The state of our state is strong. That statement is no less true today then it was for each of the two preceding years. In fact, it may be more true now when you consider employment numbers, increased job opportunities, revenue growth and the expanding prestige of our state in the international marketplace. We currently have the lowest unemployment rate we have experienced in nearly 4 years. It is still too high. That is why we must insist that every young person get a high school diploma; otherwise, they become the fuel that stokes the fires of the unemployment furnace. We are continuing to see promising job growth and many of these jobs are paying substantially above the average wage in our state. Since I stood before you last year at this address, we have announced more than 10,000 jobs, and many of these are on the high end of the employment scale. More and more businesses are deciding to make Georgia their home. Some of the reasons for these decisions are government policies of low taxes and reasonable regulations. Together, we are showing the world that we are running state government the way it should be: in an efficient, common sense and businesslike manner. And clearly businesses are taking note of this! We have spent taxpayer dollars wisely. Using 2012 dollars, our per capita spending of government money is 17 percent less that it was a decade ago. And we currently have more than 9,000 fewer state employees than we had five years ago. We have saved taxpayer dollars. The Revenue Shortfall Reserve, better known as the Rainy Day Fund, has been increased by 226 percent since I became Governor. We have reduced the burden on Georgia taxpayers. The Tax Foundation in an article published last month confirms that our state has decreased its state tax collections per capita over the last decade the most of any state in the nation, collecting 25 percent less in real dollars than it did ten years earlier. And last year, with tax reform, you lowered that burden again by increasing the deduction for married couples filing a joint return, bringing the total deduction to $7,400, thus virtually abolishing the so-called marriage tax penalty. There is good reason to believe our job base will continue to grow. Employers like to locate in a state that operates its own affairs in a businesslike manner. But it is not only businesses that pay attention to the fact that we have downsized state government and kept our budget balanced while not raising but actually lowering taxes. Others are watching our state operations, as well, like the three major bond rating agencies that have once again awarded a Triple A rating to Georgia. This comes at a time when some states and the federal government have experienced a downgrade in their ratings. This saves us taxpayer money by reducing the interest rate on our state bonds. The goal I have set for us is to make Georgia the No. 1 place in the country in which to do business. With Commissioner Cummiskey and his superb team at the Department of Economic Development, we are well on our way to achieving our goal. For two years in a row, we have ranked in the top five for business climate by Site Selection Magazine, and we ranked No. 3 for doing business in 2012 by Area Development Magazine. Our state is blessed to have the busiest airport in the world in Atlantas Hartsfield-Jackson airport. This provides us with rapid access to and from about 80 percent of the U.S. population within two hours. It is also one of the reasons certain businesses are coming to our state. Another asset is the Port of Savannah, the fourth largest container port in the country and the second largest on the East Coast. As you know, we have worked for many years to expand the Savannah Harbor and deepen the channel in order to allow the larger vessels that will soon be coming through the Panama Canal to dock in our state. We are very pleased that last fall we succeeded in getting a positive Record of Decision from the federal government. This is a major milestone on this project. My budget includes an additional $50 million in the bond package for this project. This will bring our total state contribution to $231 million. That is almost the states entire contemplated share of the costs of this project; the remainder of the cost is to be paid by the federal government. While that is a sizable amount of money we expect the benefits to be $5.50 for every dollar spentNot a bad return on investment! I will conclude my remarks on a topic that does not require the recitation of statistics, but is one that is recognized in both the public and private domains as a cornerstone of success  that is ethics. We can build the strongest foundations of frugality, efficiency and competitiveness upon which our state government will rest; but if the citizens of Georgia dont trust us, it will all be in vain, for the vibrations of distrust will crack even the strongest foundations. There will always be those in the media and elsewhere who thrive on sowing the seeds of doubt and distrust and who will never recant their sinister innuendos and malicious accusations even when they are vanquished by Truth. And while you will never silence those voices of discord, nor should you try to do so, you can bolster the confidence of the public that might be tempted to listen to them by simply establishing clear rules under which you and those who deal with you in your capacity as elected officials must operate. If there is to be an expansion of the code of ethical conduct for members of the General Assembly, it should apply equally to all elected officials at the state and local levels. We have laid our foundations for a strong and successful Georgiapublic safety, education, healthcare, economic development and ethics. I look forward to working with each of you this session as we continue to grow Georgia in these most crucial areas. And together, we will run a state rather than its citizens lives. May God give you wisdom in your deliberations, and may he continue to bless this great state of Georgia.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2013/jan/29/nathan-deal/deal-rainy-day-fund-blossoming/,Politics,Polifact
21064,Judge grants Measure 11 convict a rare early release,"BURNS -- A blustery Sunday afternoon last November found Circuit Judge William Cramer Jr. catching up on files in the closed Harney County Courthouse. Cramer came to a one-page document, extraordinary for what it would do. The order, awaiting only Cramer's approval, would conditionally release a convict years shy of finishing his mandated sentence. Cramer signed it. With that, he freed Charles L. Clifford and landed in a renewed debate over Measure 11, Oregon's tough crime initiative. The law, passed by voters in 1994, is under new scrutiny as the state prepares to reconsider who should punish criminals: judges or voters. Cramer presided over the 2009 trial that convicted Clifford, now 36, of badly injuring a man in a late-night brawl. The judge sent Clifford to prison for the mandatory 70 months -- nearly six years -- but not before declaring that the sentence was too harsh. The order gave Cramer a chance to release Clifford after he had served the time the judge had in mind at the outset. Measure 11 The law sets mandatory minimum sentences for crimes including murder, kidnapping, robbery and assault. 1994: The year Oregonians passed it, 65% to 35% 6,052: Inmates serving time under the measure 11 as of April 1 17: Of those, inmates under 18 762: Oregonians convicted of Measure 11 crimes in 2009, the year Charles L. Clifford was found guilty 692: Convicted in 2011 14%: Inmates arriving at the Corrections Department with such convictions 46%: Portion of all sentences, in months, handed out in 2011 that were under the measure 15: Age at which those charged under the measure are tried as adults 25 years: The minimum Measure 11 sentence for murder 7 years: The minimum for first-degree robbery or first-degree assault 5 years, 10 months: The minimum for second-degree assault, Cliffords conviction Sources: Oregon Corrections Department, Oregon Criminal Justice Commission Such releases are exceedingly rare. Attorneys involved in Clifford's case could think of only a couple of others in recent years, even with more than 6,000 Oregon inmates serving sentences under Measure 11. Clifford's release is tied to an appeal of his conviction -- and he'll return to prison if he loses. Yet as Gov. John Kitzhaber prepares to assign a new panel to take up sentencing reform, Cramer and the state's other 172 circuit judges could get more discretion in future cases. Kitzhaber is seeking an overhaul of the criminal justice system, including sentencing, to rein in galloping costs. The state spends an average of $30,000 a year to house, feed and care for an inmate -- part of a corrections system that burns through $1 billion in every two-year budget and is projected to cost $600 million more over the next decade if nothing is done. View full size Last year, a commission appointed by Kitzhaber recommended giving judges more power over sentences as part of the answer. But tinkering with Measure 11 is tricky. Voters overwhelmingly approved it. And prosecutors, a potent political power, say the measure has contributed to a drop in crime across Oregon. They argue that sentences have been reasonable and that only the worst felons face the measure's brute force. Defense attorneys vehemently disagree. They say too many defendants are getting prison terms harsher than necessary to protect the public and reform felons. For Cramer, who rejected big city legal work to return to his roots in eastern Oregon, the issue is what is just. ""We cried a lot"" Clifford had only a couple of traffic citations on his record when he landed in trouble. He'd grown up in the Willamette Valley, where he graduated from Woodburn High School before becoming a carpenter. He moved to the tiny community of Crane, about a half-hour east of Burns, in 2006 with the oldest of his two daughters from two relationships. He knew the area from visits to hunt and help friends with spring branding. ""I thought, 'This is a great place to raise kids,'"" Clifford said. He enrolled his daughter in third grade and returned to work as a carpenter. In his spare time, he helped coach youth wrestling teams and volunteered to roof a new community church. Then, in May 2008, he got in a fight outside the El Toreo Mexican Restaurant in Burns just before closing time. A jury convicted him of second-degree assault for breaking the other man's jaw. The verdict came on the last day of school in 2009. Clifford picked up his daughter to take her camping and to break the news. ""We were sitting around the campfire, eating marshmallows. I told her her dad was going away,"" Clifford said. ""We cried a lot."" Neighbors wrote to Cramer to ask for compassion. Clifford was well-liked, they wrote, and a devoted father. They asked Cramer to consider the damage a prison sentence would inflict on Clifford's daughter. Clifford, too, asked for leniency at his sentencing hearing in May 2009. ""I did what I had to do, what I thought at the time in the heat of the moment,"" Clifford said, according to the court transcript. ""And as far as going too far, I stopped when he stopped coming at me. And I don't want to cause harm to anybody, period. But what's done is done."" Cramer won't discuss the still-open case, but the transcript shows he thought Clifford deserved no more than 37 months. ""You would have been eligible in my mind for alternative incarceration programs and things that would have reduced that further,"" the judge said. ""So if anybody wants to know what I would have done if I'd had the discretion to do so, that's what I would have done."" But Measure 11 required a minimum 70-month sentence. ""The voters of this state determined that for certain types of crimes, a one-size-fits-all sentencing,"" Cramer said, acknowledging that many in his courtroom that day probably voted for Measure 11. ""And what it does is serve to take away any discretion that judges have for particular types of crimes. It doesn't allow me to take into account that even if it's a serious injury, some serious injuries are different than other serious injuries."" Clifford was ordered to pay restitution of $62,000 and sent to Snake River Correctional Institution just outside Ontario. His ex-wife took custody of their daughter. ""You're going home"" Then last year, Ingrid MacFarlane, a deputy state public defender, petitioned Cramer to release Clifford as his appeal moved forward. She argued that Cramer did, in fact, have the authority to impose the sentence he wanted. She also argued that Clifford should have been convicted of a lesser crime. Either way, a successful appeal would mean Clifford had already served his time. Cramer agreed. Harney County District Attorney Tim Colahan couldn't dissuade Cramer, and turned to the state Justice Department for help. But it had no better luck getting the Oregon Supreme Court to intervene. Clifford, who had been transferred to minimum-security South Fork Forest Camp outside Tillamook, had been told his chances of getting out early were ""nil."" He got the surprising news when he returned with a work crew. ""You're going home,"" an officer told him. He moved to his mom's home in Canby, married and returned to construction work. He has visits with both daughters. But if he loses his appeal, now pending before the state Supreme Court, he could be back in prison by summer. DA still objects Clifford says that would be a waste. He doesn't see himself as a threat. He also thinks voters should take another look at Measure 11. If voters don't want judges deciding sentences, they could just have minimum-wage clerks push through the paperwork. ""What do we have a judge sitting there for?"" Clifford asked. That's a good question, said Darryl Larson, retired circuit judge and current chairman of the state Criminal Justice Commission. ""Sentencing is a time-honored process that the judge is supposed to do,"" Larson said. ""The judge hears from both the prosecution and the defense. He looks at the facts to whether they merit a particular sentence. Under Measure 11, the judge is pretty much taken out of the equation."" But Colahan, who still objects to Cramer's actions, said Clifford's case didn't call for any discretion. ""I have difficulty in seeing a jury having convicted Mr. Clifford of the offense only to see a court unilaterally reduce that sentence,"" he said. Fellow prosecutors note that 58 percent of those convicted of Measure 11 crimes get consecutive sentences for multiple crimes. ""Judges have used their discretion and, after reviewing the evidence, determined that mandatory minimum is not enough,"" said Wasco County District Attorney Eric Nisley, speaking as president of the Oregon District Attorneys Association. -- Les Zaitz",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/oregon/statements/2013/jan/18/john-kitzhaber/does-oregon-spend-10000-year-student-30000-inmate/,Politics,Polifact
21066,State of the State 2012: Full text of Gov. Christie's speech,"The full text of Gov. Chris Christie's State of the State speech, as prepared for delivery: Lt. Governor Guadagno, Madam Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the 215th Legislature, Members of our Congressional Delegation, Members of the Supreme Court, our former governors and the people of the State of New Jersey: This has been a difficult week for all of us who work in this State House and are committed to public service. Over one week ago, we lost our friend Alex DeCroce. During this week, we have celebrated his life in this chamber, at his wake, at his funeral mass and, undoubtedly in the homes of the thousands of New Jerseyans whose lives he touched during his 23 years of service in the Assembly. We cap that week of recognition today by flying all flags on government buildings across our State at half staff in Alexs honor. Now, if you will all please join me in a moment of silence to honor Alexs life and legacy. Knowing Alex as well as I did over the last 19 years, I know he would tell me, Enough of this now, Chris. Lets get back to work. That is exactly what I intend to do. It is a pleasure to return to this chamber to report to you on the State of our State. Today, I am proud to report that the New Jersey Comeback has begun. How do we know it has begun? Just look around you. In the last two years, we have come together to address the mess that was our budget. The decline, deficits, and departures that plagued our State just two years ago have been reversed. The budget is balanced. Our unemployment rate is no longer going up, it is coming down. Job growth has been restored  in the private sector, where we want it. New Jersey is back. We have restrained the growth of property taxes. We have put our pensions on a more stable and sustainable footing. And in doing all this, we have restored confidence and pride in New Jersey. The New Jersey Comeback is taking place in large part because of what we have done in this chamber. Together, we have done something that Trenton hasnt seen in a very long time. We worked together. We achieved compromise. And we put New Jersey and its people first. For New Jersey, the corner has been turned. Today, the debate is not about who to blame for our failures, it is how to build on our successes. It is no longer about how to deal with devastating decline; it is now about how to push New Jersey even further ahead. To be better than we thought we could be. In these last two years New Jersey has set the standard for governance in America: be honest; dont mince words; and do the big and difficult things. Not only because it is right, but because it lays the foundation for future greatness. Now its our job to finish the task. *** Job one is the economy. Consider where we were just two years ago. When I raised my hand to take the oath of office then, I could not say with confidence that the State would meet its payroll within two months. Imagine that, New Jersey unable to meet its payroll. That was the gravity of the mess we were left to deal with due to the mismanagement which reigned in this town before our arrival. Our deficit for that fiscal year, already more than half over, was more than two billion dollars. The budget problems for the next year, fiscal year 2011, was a record deficit of $11 billion. The solution was not easy, but it was also not complicated. We had spent too much as a state. We had lived beyond our means. And by trying to tax their way out of it, previous governors and legislators had left New Jersey in 50th place  dead last among the states  in the total tax burden it placed on our citizens. We had the highest tax rate in the nation, the highest unemployment rate in a quarter century, and the largest budget deficit per person of any state in the nation. So step one was to stop the bleeding  by stopping the spending. We cut 375 programs in that first fiscal year, saved two billion dollars for the taxpayers, and brought Jon Corzines budget into balance. Next, with your help, we enacted a budget that imposed discipline, in the form of another cut in spending, for the second year in a row: cutting spending for each and every department of state government. That was tough medicine  but it was the beginning of better health. Last year, because we took that medicine, we were strong enough to reduce business taxes and improve New Jerseys climate for job creation. I want to thank this legislature for joining me in recognizing that  for New Jersey to grow private sector jobs again  we must reduce the tax burden on our citizens and our businesses. Step two was controlling property taxes. As everyone in New Jersey already knows, they had risen 70% in the ten years before I became governor. Rising property taxes were driving people out of this state. And so we joined together  and again I thank this legislature and in particular your leaders, Senate President Sweeney and Speaker Oliver  to cap property tax growth at no more than 2% a year. And we put the same 2% cap on the interest arbitration awards that were giving rise to higher taxes. We must never forget that the root cause of rising property taxes is always excessive government spending. As with all problems, you must get to that root cause  and together, we did it. And heres the good news: it is working. Last week, the states largest newspaper announced the results of its comprehensive study of property taxes in New Jersey. The headline said it all: At long last, tax relief. Step three was to get a grip on our long-term liabilities. Our pension system was $54 billion in debt at the start of 2011, and scheduled to be underwater by $180 billion in three short decades without a change in course. It was imperative that we save these pensions for our middle class and at the same time lift the burden off of our taxpayers created by the unrealistic promises made by career politicians. And so we confronted the obvious, negotiated a solution and saved taxpayers over $120 billion dollars. The pensions of every state worker, of every teacher, and of every retired municipal employee are more secure today. By the tough choices we made together, we saved their pensions. Again, the solutions were not easy, and not always popular, but they were also not complicated. We had to raise the retirement age a bit; we had to get a grip on the effect of COLAs; we had to make sure that the contributions of employees were fair, and that the state kicked in also. But by taking these steps we made a big dent in the problem. At the same time, we had a public employee health system that was $67 billion in deficit in January of 2011. To right this wrong, we relied on two simple principles: we should give employees more choice and everyone must pay their fair share. We, once again, compromised with each other to right a failing system and, in the process made political history in New Jersey. We came together. We took on the special interests. We put our citizens first. At the time, the New York Post said we had pulled off something of a miracle in pension reform. But it wasnt magic. In a country dominated in so many places by partisan bickering, we just had to be honest and realistic about the math, and grown-up about the answers. And the good news is this  the people of New Jersey can take it. Weve shown the rest of the country that we are Jersey strong. Today, the results of that Jersey strength and that Jersey attitude are beginning to show. Since our administration came into office, New Jersey has added over 60,000 new private sector jobs. Remember, in 2009, the state lost 117,000 jobs. According to Rutgers University economist Joseph Seneca, 2011 was the best private sector job growth year in New Jersey since 2000. 60,000 new private sector jobs since we took office. The best job growth year in more than 11 years. Here is my promise to the people of New Jersey: We will keep the momentum going. I will not permit anyone to re-impose the tax raising, overspending, irresponsible ways of our past which led to our dark decade of joblessness in New Jersey. Stand strong with me and I will stand up for you. We are going in the right direction and I will oppose any move to return us to the despair those policies brought to New Jersey and its citizens. The new direction is clear. We have changed the business environment in this state and, as a result, we are changing the jobs environment. From Asurion (which established its regional headquarters in Bridgewater), to Allergan (which picked New Jersey for its northeast research and development center), we have been able to attract new jobs from around the country to New Jersey. From Watson Pharmaceuticals (which moved to Parsippany), to Pinnacle Foods (which moved to Cherry Hill), employers are beginning to understand that New Jersey is once again a friendly state for businesses and jobs  a great place to work and raise a family. And its not just around the country. People are recognizing the New Jersey Comeback all around the world Bayer put its North American headquarters in Morris County, Novo Nordisk in Middlesex County, and LG Electronics in Bergen County. We have begun this turnaround in the face of strong national headwinds. Across our country, growth is still anemic. There has been no national solution to our debt and deficit problem, no catalyst for growth, no leadership on the economy. The politics of envy have overtaken the imperative of opportunity. Our economy suffers while Washington politicians  in both parties  fiddle. Americas position of strength and leadership around the world deteriorates while our leaders bicker and blame. Over the last two years New Jersey did the exact opposite. We achieved results because we did it together. Over the last two years weve said  lets put aside our differences on some issues so were able to work together on others. Now it doesnt mean we didnt shout at each other. It doesnt mean we didnt get angry. You may even recall that even some of my friends had some very colorful nicknames for me. Now, that anger is natural, that passion is good, but we have shown that on the important issues, on the really big things, we can still come together to lead the people of New Jersey to a better outcome. Weve shown that its possible to hold fast to key principles, but still reach compromise. Weve shown New Jersey, and the nation that there is a better way. That divided government can work; that Democrats and Republicans working together is possible. And in fact its necessary. Two years ago at my inaugural, I asked Senator Sweeney and Speaker Oliver to join me in a handshake to demonstrate our commitment to working together  sticking to our principles, but finding common ground for the good of the people. Our handshake that day was a symbol, because it could be nothing more than that. Back then, we had nothing to show the people but our good faith and the promise for tomorrow. Today, no symbolic handshake is needed. Thankfully, we have shown through our deeds that we are willing to work together. Substance over form. Accomplishments over partisanship. Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Sheila. So in this year, in 2012, let us continue to show the state and the nation what is possible. Let New Jersey continue to set the example. Let New Jersey continue to lead the way. And let us do it together. *** Over the last two years weve had to make some tough choices. It was important to do what was difficult and what was necessary to get New Jersey out of its hole. But, because of these hard decisions, the shared sacrifice and because we stuck to our discipline we can now focus on our priorities. We will have to continue to hold the line on spending. And I guarantee you this: the budget I submit, and any budget I will ultimately sign into law in June, will be truly balanced. But we have been working to get to this moment. To finally have New Jersey right side up, so we can focus on the big things. To challenge ourselves to be better. To strive for greatness. To ensure that every New Jerseyan is given the opportunity to have the life they want. So in my budget, I will fulfill a promise I made to all the people of New Jersey in 2009. Real relief from the heavy income tax burden that has strangled our families and forced many to move away. I propose to reduce income tax rates for each and every New Jerseyan. In every tax bracket. By 10% across the board. I also propose to fully restore the earned income tax credit for New Jerseys working poor, which we were forced to cut during the dark days of 2010, when growth was gone and we had no money. Understand what this means  every New Jerseyan will get a cut in taxes. The working poor. The struggling middle class. The new college graduates getting their first job. The senior citizens who have already retired. The single mom. The job creators. The parents trying to afford to send their son or daughter to college. Everyone made the sacrifice. Everyone will share in the benefit. This will send a loud signal to New Jerseyans and would-be New Jerseyans, to families here now and families who have left, to businesses and job creators thinking of coming here and those who have struggled to stay: New Jersey is once again a place to plan your future, raise your family, grow your business and someday retire. The New Jersey Comeback has begun. Lets be under no illusions  our job in turning New Jersey around is far from finished. We have improved our tax climate  but, there is much work to be done. For make no mistake  we are in a competition. A competition for jobs  among countries, yes, but also among states. In the last decade, two-thirds of all companies which moved jobs to a new location did not move to other countries  they moved from one state to another. Here in our region, our most direct competitors are making very different choices. In Connecticut, the governor has raised income tax rates on top earners and job creators. And New York last month enacted legislation to do the same. Other big states are also raising taxes. Californias governor has proposed to raise the top rate  already among the highest in the nation, by up to two percentage points. Illinois has already adopted a law to raise all income taxes by 67%. In this environment, the best way to compete is to show a different direction. Let others choose tax increases. We choose responsible tax cuts to give our overburdened citizens real relief. And to help New Jersey grow. Now some will argue, Wait a minute: New York only raised taxes on the rich. Why not adopt Governor Cuomos package for New Jersey? Here are the facts. If we enacted the exact same income tax rates put into law by New York last month, every person earning below $100,000 a year would face a tax increase  of anywhere from 150 to 200%. And, by the way, those earning a million dollars would get a tax cut. Is that what we want? Is that fairness? I dont think so. An across the board tax cut is fair  every New Jersey taxpayer will benefit. Every New Jerseyans rates will go down. Every New Jerseyan will see relief. This is exactly what I was talking about when I took office; that the tough choices would lead to the right ones. Today, because we have put our fiscal house in order we can budget for our priorities and give tax relief to all of our people. Tax relief that will lead to better lives for our citizens and more jobs for our state. Job number two is to reform our education system  to strengthen our schools. Over the course of the last year, since outlining my proposals from this podium, I have worked with this legislature  on a bipartisan basis  to put in front of you a package of bills that will address the biggest challenges facing public education in New Jersey. We have had a year to debate, discuss and deliberate. Now, in 2012, it is time to act. New Jersey, in so many ways, is blessed. The majority of our schoolchildren continue to perform well, above most other states, on national student assessment tests. New Jersey has so many great teachers producing so many great students. Too many in the educational establishment, however, use that very real success as a camouflage for abject failure elsewhere in New Jersey. To use the success of others as an excuse to block change for those we are failing is not only wrong, it is immoral. Too many of our schools are failing our children, and they have been failing for far too long. We live in a time when educational attainment and economic success are correlated as never before. That is a good thing. It means that for this generation of Americans, what you can achieve will be driven not by who you know, but by what you know. You need to look only at the recent Harvard/Columbia study of 2.5 million students over 20 years in America. Its independent research supports what I told you from my heart, from this podium, one year ago. Great teachers have a more significant impact on their students future success than average ones. Even more importantly, average teachers have an even greater effect on their students when they replace underperforming teachers. Research that confirms our own common sense. Tenure reform will lead to even greater student achievement because replacing underperforming teachers with even an average teacher raises each classrooms lifetime earnings by over a quarter of a million dollars. Lets act on real tenure reform now. Lets replace despair with hope in every classroom in New Jersey. Because I believe it is obscene to be satisfied. When the chance for a life filled with hope and opportunity is determined not by how hard you are willing to work but by where you happen to live. Not by your intelligence, but by your zip code. Lets face it: more money does not necessarily lead to a better education. Today, in Newark, we spend $23,000 per student for instruction and services. But only 23% of ninth graders who enter high school this year will receive high school diplomas in four years. Asbury Park is similar: per pupil costs, at almost $30,000 a year, are nearly 75% above the state average. But the dropout rate is almost 10 times the state average. And math S.A.T. scores lag the state average by 180 points. It is time to admit that the Supreme Courts grand experiment with New Jersey children is a failure. 63% of state aid over the years has gone to the Abbott Districts and the schools are still predominantly failing. What weve been doing isnt working for children in failing districts, it is unfair to the other 557 school districts and to our states taxpayers, who spend more per pupil than almost any state in America. Basic human decency and simple common sense say it is time for a different and better approach. The tools to give our children and their parents who are confronted with failing schools the chance for a better outcome are before you. They are embodied in bills which are bipartisan in nature and consistent with the reform advocated by President Obama, Education Secretary Duncan and most recently by New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo. My proposals reflect the input the administration has received at hundreds of meetings with educators, parents and professionals around the state. They are supported by independent research done at Harvard and Columbia. Most importantly, they reflect the intention we should all have: to put children first. The momentum to put children first began last week when you passed, and I traveled to Camden to sign, the Urban Hope Act. This new law will allow school districts in Newark, Camden and Trenton to partner with experts in the private sector to build and operate renaissance schools in these districts so in need of change. We have given some of our urban schools a signal that hope is on the way. I want to thank Senator Donald Norcross and Mayor Dana Redd for their bi-partisan support of this idea. You and I both know that this is a good start, but only a start. There is much more work to do. Here is what I propose:  First, reform tenure  by measuring teacher effectiveness, both with professional observation, and objective, quantifiable measures of student achievement  and then by giving tenure to those with strong evaluations, and taking it away from those whose ratings are unacceptably weak. We cannot ask parents to accept failure in teachers when their childrens lives hang in the balance;  Second, if layoffs are necessary remove the least effective teachers instead of just the most junior ones. It is time to end the system of last in, first out, which protects some of the worst and penalizes some of the best;  Third, pay teachers more when they are assigned to a failing school or to teach a difficult subject. Compensation should be designed to attract and retain effective teachers where we need them most;  Fourth, end forced placements. Teachers should not be assigned to schools without the mutual consent of the teacher and the principal. If an acceptable placement cant be found in 12 months, the school district should have the right to place the teacher on permanent unpaid leave;  Fifth, we should reform our process for authorizing charter schools to attract the best operators to New Jersey, to streamline the process for the best performers, to focus on our failing school districts and to encourage innovation. We must give parents and children in failing schools an alternative; and  Last, and perhaps most importantly, establish tax credits to provide scholarships for low income students in the worst-performing schools in the state to enable them to attend a better school, either out of the district or a private school. Opportunity should not be offered to only those in an excellent school district or with parents who have the money to release their children from the prison that is a failing school. Lets pass the opportunity scholarship act now. These are not radical reforms; they are common sense. They are not rash; they are long overdue. And they are not luxuries which can afford to languish for another six months or another year; they are essential for New Jerseys success. I have a message that is not from me, but from the single mom in Newark, and the struggling parents in Camden, as well as the employers in our state: education reform has waited long enough. *** New Jersey is one of Americas most diverse states. This means we have diverse problems, but also diverse opportunities. It means we must build the skills and improve the opportunities for many types of people, from all backgrounds and all walks of life. And it means we must work in multiple ways to improve the quality of life for everyone. Creating jobs and fixing the schools are probably the two most important ways to do that, but there are other steps we can take as well to improve the quality of life in New Jersey. This leads me to job number three. We need to reclaim our inner cities, respond to underserved regions, and engage our most vulnerable citizens. A few months ago, I hosted a town hall meeting in Union City with Senator Brian Stack. A woman from Newark was there. A mother. A neighbor. A concerned citizen. That day, she asked me a very direct question  and actually, I believe it was a question for all of us. She said, I just wonder if the amount of violence, the amount of shootings, the amount of murders that take place in the City of Newark. I just wonder sometimes if it bothers you like it bothers us. Particularly the mothers who have lost their children. And she ended her question with a plea. Help us, she said, Help us. Well, that woman was Cassandra Dock. And I met with her and her neighbors. She is here in this chamber today. I ask all of you to send a message that in New Jersey we are creating a place where everyone is given the opportunity to live the life they want. I ask all of you to join me in saying to Cassandra. Yes, we will help you. Here is one example: we can only improve our quality of life by keeping the most violent criminals off the streets. So, I ask you to approve my bail reform package, which would mirror the federal system. It would keep offenders with a history of violence who are a danger to our communities in jail until the time of their trial, instead of releasing them into society to prey on the public. This may require a constitutional amendment but it is reform that is long overdue. Do you know that if a person is arrested with a long record of violence we cannot detain that person in jail pending trial? We must release that person, regardless of how dangerous they are to potential witnesses against them or innocent members of our society. Let us amend our bail laws to allow judges to consider the factor of dangerousness to our communities before we release a violent person back on to the street to maim or kill while they await trial. This, too, is just simple common sense. At the same time, let us reclaim the lives of those drug offenders who have not committed a violent crime. By investing time and money in drug treatment  in an in-house, secure facility  rather than putting them in prison. Experience has shown that treating non-violent drug offenders is two-thirds less expensive than housing them in prison. And more importantly  as long as they have not violently victimized society  everyone deserves a second chance, because no life is disposable. I am not satisfied to have this as merely a pilot project; I am calling for a transformation of the way we deal with drug abuse and incarceration in every corner of New Jersey. So today I ask this Legislature and the Chief Justice to join me in this commitment that no life is disposable. I propose mandatory treatment for every non-violent offender with a drug abuse problem in New Jersey, not just a select few. It will send a clear message to those who have fallen victim to the disease of drug abuse  we want to help you, not throw you away. We will require you to get treatment. Your life has value. Every one of Gods creations can be redeemed. Everyone deserves a second chance. *** These are the big things Id like us to focus on in 2012. These are my priorities. We know in our hearts that we represent some of the toughest, the most direct and honest people in America. A group of people who are destined for great things if we just give them the opportunity. But we also know that for too many years these same people were depressed about what New Jersey had become. Our leaders disappointed us in many different ways. Promises were made that werent even attempted to be kept. Our economy suffocated under the wet blanket of overtaxation, overspending, overborrowing and overregulation. Our education systems failed those who needed it the most, and our leaders stood by and said, be patient, and well fix it. In popular culture, New Jersey had become a punch line, rather than a place of pride. Whats happened in the last two years? Over the last two years, New Jersey is now seen around the country once again, not exclusively as the butt of late night jokes, but as a focus of the evening news and the Sunday talk shows. Why? Because, once again, we are leading America  by taking on the big things in public policy. Weve known all along that our State is destined for great things. We just needed to give the people of our State the confidence that can come from watching leaders work together and from a state rising again all around them. To everyone in this room, to everyone watching in their home or listening in their car, I have one simple message: for the New Jersey Comeback to continue and grow, we must all come together. This obligation is not just mine and it is not just Kims. It is not just Steves or Sheilas, not just Toms or Jons. The New Jersey Comeback is not about what happens in Trenton alone. All of you are in this too. Our wins and losses are your wins and losses. Our successes and failures are your successes and failures. The New Jersey Comeback didnt start just here and it wont be sustained just here. The New Jersey Comeback is yours, too. And so I say to all of you, regardless of where you are, regardless of what region of our State you come from, regardless of what political party you call home, you have had a stake in what has happened over the last two years, and you have contributed to making it happen. Now is not the time to stop, now is the time to double down. Now is not the time to put the brakes on New Jerseys growth. Now it is the time to put the foot down harder on the accelerator. Now is not the time to turn back. Now is the time to make New Jersey greatness a reality again. That is what the next two years of my governorship will be dedicated to every day. We have climbed out of the hole that was left to us  together. Now it is time to raise the great flag of the State of New Jersey as high as we can  together. I cannot do it alone. Republicans cannot do it alone. Democrats cannot do it alone. Because, as Martin Luther King once said, We may have come on different ships, but were in the same boat now. We must do this together in every town, every city and every county across our state. If you are ready to join that fight with me in the next two years as you have in the last two years, we will be here two years from now looking at a state that once again is a leader for a rejuvenated America. If you are willing to join that fight, so am I  on your behalf. That is what you elected me to do. And that is the solemn commitment I make to you again today. Thank you, God bless you, God bless America and God bless the great State of New Jersey.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2013/jan/17/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-current-fiscal-year-income-tax/,Politics,Polifact
21068,"Dewhurst, Straus, Perry See Opportunity to Take Up Tax Relief in Session","In a joint appearance Wednesday, the states top leaders offered few specifics about legislative priorities, but Gov. Rick Perry, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and House Speaker Joe Straus seemed to agree that taxes would go down. Dewhurst was the only one who named specifics, saying lawmakers are looking at lowering business and property taxes. But Perry and Straus also suggested that tax relief was on the horizon. I think we have a record proving that tax relief should be a priority,"" Straus said. ""The details of that and the potential for that are yet to be determined."" The three leaders appeared together at a Capitol news conference on the second day of the 140-day session after having breakfast at the Texas Governors Mansion. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. Perry, the longest-serving governor in Texas history by far, said he wanted to hear from Texans about what taxes they want to cut before deciding on a plan. The leaders were far less committal on the level of spending for public education, which was cut by more than $5 billion last session. Asked if the Legislature would restore funding for public education, Perry suggested that the question itself was flawed. He said education spending has been more than adequate over the last decade. Weve had public education funding growing at three times the public education enrollment. So youve had a 70 percent increase of funding from 2002 to 2012. You've had a 23 percent increase in enrollment growth, he said. I think under any scenario over the last decade, the funding that we have seen in the state of Texas for public education has been pretty phenomenal. Im not sure theres any state in the nation thats had that type of [growth], certainly not any big state, Perry continued. Were getting the job done in public education. Straus, who has spoken of the need to build infrastructure for future generations, referred obliquely to unfinished business from last session but didnt commit to any specific level of education funding. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. Dewhurst said that with school finance litigation pending, the discussion was largely academic. Were going to be putting more resources into public education, and there is no reason for us to get into a dialogue back and forth what that number should be because weve got 400, 40 percent of our school districts, have sued us, Dewhurst said. So were going to have a court, one or more courts, tell us what is the right number for us to put in and well fund it.

21147,How to Improve Higher Education: Eight Ideas from the Experts,"Bill Haslam, Governor of Tennessee. One of the biggest challenges states face is producing a workforce qualified to meet the needs of employers in todays economy. In order to increase degree attainment and begin to close the skills gap that exists between workforce supply and industry demand, states should change the way they fund higher education. States have traditionally funded their public institutions of higher education based on enrollments. This means the more students attending an institution, the more money that institution receives from the state. While this may incentivize colleges to expand access, it does nothing to incentivize efficiency and productivity. Institutions are rewarded for admitting more students and keeping them enrolled as long as possible, not for ensuring that every student is making progress toward a degree and ultimately leaving with a credential that has value in the labor market. Instead of funding public colleges and universities based on enrollments, states should use a formula that pays institutions for success in key areas like progress toward and completion of degrees and credentials. Thats what were doing in Tennessee. In 2010, our state adopted a new modelone that funds institutions based on outcomes. While we continue to build on our efforts to raise educational attainment levels in Tennessee and make sure our workforce is prepared for a dynamic economy, other states are following suit and implementing performance-based funding models within their higher education systems. Although Tennessee remains the only state to have a 100 percent outcomes-based model, four other states now determine institutions base funding through an outcomes-centered approach. Several other states either have in place or are transitioning to some type of performance funding. Although some in higher education may oppose tying funding to outcomes, we are already seeing this model changing the way our postsecondary institutions do business, and we know our workforce will be the beneficiary.

21233,Burzichelli Defends Budget Hearing as Christie Continues to Tout Tax Cut,"The Assembly Budget Committee held a hearing today, a day after Standard & Poors lowered New Jerseys credit outlook from stable to negative based partly on lower than anticipated revenue projections. More than a week ago, David Rosen, chief budget officer at the Office of Legislative Services, stated in a memo that tax collections for fiscal 2012 fell $254 million short of Gov. Christies budget forecast. Christie whose tax cut proposal rests largely on projections of a 7.2 percent revenue gain had sharp words for Rosen, dismissing the OLS chiefs new numbers. Rosen appeared at todays hearing but noticeably absent was the state treasurer Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff, who declined an invitation to testify. Democratic assemblyman John Burzichelli (D-3), a member of the budget committee, spoke to NJ Today Managing Editor Mike Schneider from the state house. WATCH VIDEO: With regard to the treasurers absence, Burzichelli said he was somewhat surprised that he did not appear at todays hearing in light of the negative action on the states credit rating. The treasurer could have been helpful today to clarify a few points because the executive branch is speaking to the rating firms as New Jersey goes out to refinance and to float bonds, said Burzichelli. The governor in a radio interview this morning called todays hearing a political show. Burzichelli said he had no problem with the governors remarks, given the context in which they were made. The governors comments were made on a radio program serving a drive time audience and I respect the office of governor, I respect this governor and I respect [that] the governor has a right to say anything he chooses to say. Still, Burzichelli said the budget committee had a legitimate reason for holding the hearing because revenue numbers arent going the way the Christie administration anticipated. If adjustments have to be made in the budget as a result of the shortfall, he said experience tells him they should be made earlier rather than later because a lot of important things have to be funded through this budget that Gov. Christie signed. People who are planning to receive funding, whether it be the Department of Education, Department of Community Affairs, and how all that spreads out, theyre going to find themselves disappointed and that affects plans otherwise made. He also cited factors beyond the states control, saying were subject to a lot of things happening outside of the state, so it was important for the treasurer to be with us. The scheduling of a budget hearing at this time of year is out of the norm. The governor called the timing unprecedented. Burzichelli responded that the fact the governor is continuing to travel around state at town hall forums promoting a tax cut requires an ongoing examination of revenue coming into the state. So as the numbers tell us theyre not materializing as he anticipated they would, the ability to do a tax cut for the higher earners becomes less and less likely and thats why I think we have to have these kinds of hearings now. And we have to be in touch with the information on a more timely basis than a normal course of conduct would allow us to do.

21435,"Response to Mitt Romneys Claim That We Dont Need More Firemen, More Policemen, More Teachers","Response to Mitt Romneys Claim That We Dont Need More Firemen, More Policemen, More Teachers Comments Show Romney Has No Idea Whats Going On With Wisconsins Middle Class Families Democratic National Committee Communications Director Brad Woodhouse and President of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin Mahlon Mitchell held a press call earlier today responding to Mitt Romneys statement that we dont need more firemen, more policemen, more teachers. Listen to the Woodhouse/Mitchell call here. Wisconsinites know that firefighters, police officers, and teachers are the backbone of a successful community, and Romney suggesting they arent vital to our well-being is shocking. These are hard-working Americans who want to make their cities and towns a better place and ensure that every American has a shot at the American Dream and the opportunity to live in a safe, prosperous community. To say anything otherwise is further proof that Mitt Romney is detached from the reality of Wisconsinites. But this comes as no surprise coming from a candidate who has joked about being unemployed himself, said he likes firing people and claimed that corporations are people. Obviously, Romney doesnt get it. Mitt Romney saying we dont benefit from more firefighters, police officers and teachers is further proof of his philosophy of Romney Economics: tax cuts for the wealthy over investments in our community  the same formula that benefitted a few, but crashed our economy and punished the middle class. In Massachusetts, firefighters were among the many victims of Romney Economics. As Romney made clear on Friday, he doesnt care about these jobs  but as governor, he didnt seem to care about their safety either, vetoing millions of dollars for fire-safety equipment and targeting that equipment with a line-item veto. From that earlier call, these remarks prepared for delivery: DNC Communications Director Brad Woodhouse Thank you for joining the call today. As you know, last week Mitt Romney showed just how out of touch he is with middle-class Wisconsinites. In addition to joking that he is unemployed, that he thinks corporations are people too, and telling us that he likes firing people, in a moment of candor Mitt Romney said we dont need more firefighters, policemen, and teachers. These types of statements and this type of sentiment is absolutely shocking. Listening to that, hardworking Americans have to wonder just how much more disconnected from the concerns of middle-class Americans could Mitt Romney be? These are hard-working folks who want to make their cities and towns a better place. To say anything otherwise is further proof that Mitt Romney is detached from the reality of hardworking Wisconsinites and the concerns of their everyday lives. President Obama knows that firefighters, policemen, and teachers are the backbone of a successful community and that they have been hit hard by the recession. On top of creating 4.3 million private sector jobs over the past 27 months, President Obama has given Congress a clear plan that would create as many as one million new jobs and put firefighters, policemen, and teachers back to work. But Republicans in Congress are doing nothing to pass that plan and is leaving a million jobs on the table. President Obama is the only one with a plan to move this country forward and strengthen our economy. Among the first things he did in office, President Obama saved more than 300,000 educators jobs and helped states prevent massive layoffs. And hes making sure they have the resources they need to do their jobs. He supported projects to modernize our childrens schools and smart reforms that give schools and school districts the flexibility they need to best serve students. He also supported hiring programs, provided safety equipment and modernized firehouses and police stations that have helped thousands of police, firefighters and first responders keep their jobs and keep them safe. President Obama understands that when these folks work, it not only helps our children in the classroom and keep our streets safe, but it also gives them more money to spend in their communities at the local shop or corner store. President Obama is working hard to provide solutions. And what is Mitt Romneys solution to strengthen the economy? Fire more people. Even Scott Walker in Wisconsin said that Mitt Romney learned the wrong lessons from Wisconsin in promising he will make cuts to these jobs. Mitt Romney saying that we dont benefit from more firefighters, police officers, and teachers is further proof of his philosophy of Romney Economics: more budget-busting tax cuts for the wealthy and fewer rules for Wall Streetthe same formula that benefitted a few, but crashed our economy and punished the middle class. And this is the same troubling formula that Mitt Romney put in place as governor of Massachusetts where he asked the middle class to continue to sacrifice more. Romney made drastic cuts in funding to education and first responders, and Massachusetts fell to 47th out of 50 in job creation. Middle class Americans cant afford Romney Economics: tax cuts for the wealthy over investments in our community is not the formula for a successful community. Hes promising the same solutions now. Make no mistake, though, the American people and the people of Wisconsin are going to continue to see through Mitt Romneys devastating economic plan. It didnt work in Massachusetts, it wont work in Wisconsin, and it wont work for America. President of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin Mahlon Mitchell Thank you, Brad. Im Mahlon Mitchell, the President of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin, which proudly represents thousands of professional firefighters across Wisconsin and this country. First responders and teachers were among the many victims of Romney Economics in Massachusetts. Romney has made it absolutely crystal clear  he doesnt care about our jobs. And apparently, he doesnt care about Wisconsinites safety, either. In his first year as governor of Massachusetts, Romney slashed investments in local aid, costing about 14,500 Massachusetts teachers, cops, librarians and others their jobs. Romney also vetoed millions of dollars for fire-safety equipment. And it wasnt funding in all-encompassing bill that Romney vetoed. He specifically targeted this safety equipment by vetoing it with a line-item veto. Mitt Romney first cut funding for our coats, pants, helmets and boots  equipment that is essential to do the job and that protects firefighters when they run into a burning building. He went a step further when he cut funding for handheld lights that help firefighters see through the smoke, and the devices that help them communicate with other firefighters. This type of funding wouldve saved more lives by giving firefighters the tools they need to find the victims in a fire, and to track their fellow firefighters to make sure they make it out okay. Even personal-alert safety systems, air packs, tanks and compressors were on Romneys chopping block. Thats the equipment that literally keeps firefighters alive and breathing while theyre surrounded by flames. Firefighters simply cannot do their jobs without that lifesaving equipment. Mitt Romney made it clear that equipment our first responders needed to keep themselves and our communities safe was not a priority to him. And these cuts were so contrary to the values of the Massachusetts people, that both parties in the State House and Senate overrode these vetoes unanimously. But that didnt stop Romney Economics. Governor Romney even had the gall to put a stop to building a fire station that would have been a living memorial for six local firefighters who died in a warehouse fire. This would have been important to both the families and the community, but it wasnt important enough to Mitt Romney. Regardless of what Mitt Romney might think, more cops and firefighters keep our streets safe and our communities protected. Its a fact, and anyone who says otherwise is completely disconnected from reality. The truth is Romney simply didnt advocate for the folks who wouldve risked their lives to save him if his house was on fire  and his comments on Friday prove that nothings changed. I dont know a single person other than Mitt Romney who thinks we have too many teachers, too many police officers and too many firefighters in our communities. Our first responders look out for us in tough times, and its our turn to do the same for them. Mitt Romney just doesnt understand that.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/01/mahlon-mitchell/romney-cut-millions-firefighter-gear-wisconsin-dem/,Politics,Polifact
21447,Lindsay Draws Support From Education Leaders,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE June 21, 2012 Contact: Caitie Osborne  389-3004 Lindsay draws support from education leaders HILLSBORO, Ore  Shawn Lindsay picked up support from local school board members this week in his campaign for State Representative. The father of three supported several bipartisan school reform proposals in his first-term and has been vocal about the need to reform the way schools are funded. Endorsing Lindsay are Hillsboro School Board members Carolyn Ortman, Wayne Clift, and Monte Akers. Shawn understood the need for bipartisan reforms that improve the quality of education for our students, stated Carolyn Ortman. His support for such reforms will improve the quality of education for local students and raise the bar. Lindsay fought in 2011 to ensure schools were funded first. He also sponsored legislation requiring legislators to fund schools within the first 81 days of the legislative session or face losing their paycheck. Shawn Lindsay made funding schools first a top priority, stated Wayne Clift. He backed that up by pushing to ensure the legislature voted on a school budget early giving districts like ours more time to plan our own budgets. Lindsay has long stressed that the legislature cant continue to leave schools waiting in limbo until the end of their legislative sessions every budget cycle not knowing how much classrooms will have for the coming school year. Families across Oregon set priorities and pay for the most important things out of their bank accounts first, not last, noted Lindsay. Yet in Salem they have traditionally waited until the money is almost gone to pay for the most important things in our states budget. While I think classrooms still got shortchanged in the current budget were making progress and thats good, Lindsay said. But we have a long ways to go if we want to change the status quo and direct funds from bureaucracy to the classroom. Lindsay is a strong proponent of education reform, and has voted to eliminate dozens of unfunded state mandates on Oregon schools. He supported establishing the Oregon Education Investment Board to promote strategic, outcome-based budgets for public education, as well as to give school districts more flexibility in managing their own budgets. Lindsay says he will continue to fight for reforms that ensure schools are funded early in the budgeting process, We need to require the legislature to fund schools early in the session so school boards know what they have to work with and can make wise decisions. Lindsay, 39, is an attorney with the Lane Powell law firm where he specializes in business and intellectual property work. A fourth generation Oregonian, Lindsay and his wife live in Hillsboro with their three children.

21622,"Obama: Supreme Court overturning health care would be ""unprecedented""","Carolyn Kaster UPDATED 3:20p.m. ET (CBS News) -- President Obama expressed confidence Monday the Supreme Court will not overturn his signature health care law when it issues a ruling later this year on the constitutionality of the landmark legislation, arguing it would be ""unprecedented"" for the court to make such a dramatic power play over Congress. ""I am confident that this will be upheld because it should be upheld,"" Mr. Obama told reporters at the White House when asked about the case at press availability after meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Mexican President Felipe Calderon. Mr. Obama said a decision by the nation's top court to throw out the law would be unprecedented and precisely the kind of action that many conservatives for years have criticized as overreaching ""judicial activism."" ""Ultimately I am confident that the Supreme Court will not take what would be an unprecedented, extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress,"" Mr. Obama said in the Rose Garden appearance. The Supreme Court heard three days of oral arguments in the case last week and is expected to issue its decision later this year, possibly at the end of the court's session in June. The president characterized the debate over the law as a ""political"" one, and said most constitutional law scholars believe the law should not be thrown out. ""That is not just my opinion, that is the opinion of a whole lot of constitutional law professors and academics and judges and lawyers who have examined this law even if they are not particularly sympathetic to this particular piece of legislation or my presidency,"" said Mr. Obama, himself a former constitutional law professor at the University of Chicago. ""I would just remind conservative commentators that for years what we have heard is the biggest problem on the bench was judicial activism or a lack of judicial restraint. That an unelected group of people would somehow overturn a duly constituted and passed law. Well, this is a good example and I am pretty confident that this court will recognize that and not take that step,"" he said. On the most controversial aspect of the law, a requirement that everyone purchase health insurance or pay a penalty, Mr. Obama said there is more than just a legal argument to be made. ""I think it's important, I think the American people understand, and I think the justices should understand, that in the absence of an individual mandate, you cannot have a mechanism to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions can actually get healthcare,"" the president said. ""So, there is not only an economic element to this and a legal element to this, but there is a human element to this. And I hope that is not forgotten in this political debate,"" he added.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/04/barack-obama/obama-attaches-stark-terms-possible-supreme-court-/,Politics,Polifact

21700,U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island,"Honoring Military Families Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here this evening to express my unwavering support for the men and women who have answered the call of duty in our military services, our Guard and Reserve, and for their family members whose love and steady support for them have carried our servicemembers through challenging times and difficult missions. In honor of Veterans Day, coming up the day after tomorrow, and Military Family Month, which we observe all month long this November, we need to reflect on the enormous contributions military families have made on behalf of all of us. Since September 11, the spouses, children and parents of our service men and women have been faced with huge demands. They have endured repeated deployments, and spent many holidays and birthdays and anniversaries apart from each other. We should do everything we can in our communities to help military families cope with the difficulties and stresses of these multiple deployments. I commend First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden for their commitment to our troops' families and for their work on initiatives to address the unique challenges military families face in this environment. I especially appreciate the First Lady's recent visit to Rhode Island. It provided a warm and welcome boost to military family members in my State, which has the second highest per capita National Guard deployment rate of all the States, as well as a significant active-duty presence at Naval Station Newport. With so many men and women leaving home to serve on multiple deployments, the strain on the family can be particularly difficult. Last month I had the privilege of meeting two extraordinary Rhode Island students, Kathleen Callahan, who goes by Katie, and Kaitlyn Hawley, who presented a powerful and compelling message to school superintendents and educators from across Rhode Island who came together to learn about how they can better respond to the needs of military families. These two impressive young ladies shared their personal stories and described the challenges their families faced while their parents were deployed. The event was part of a collaborative initiative to help military-connected children thrive in school through deployments. I was proud to share in this joint effort with the Rhode Island National Guard, with Governor Chafee, with our Commissioner of Education, the Commanding Officer of Naval Station Newport, our Military Child Education Coalition, and my senior Senator, Jack Reed. Katie is the daughter of a National Guard member. She described how her father's deployment affected the roles in her family. Like most children of deployed servicemembers, Katie assumed additional responsibilities in caring for her younger sibling and helping her mother, whom she referred to as a superwoman. Together, they shouldered the burden of her father's absence and kept the family intact and sound. Katie described the feeling of--to use her words--silent suffering that can occur when military families feel isolated in civilian communities that may not completely understand what it is like when a loved one is deployed. Kaitlyn is the daughter of an active-duty member. She talked about her experience living in eight different States and attending seven different schools. Kaitlyn is a highly motivated student and she explained how she threw herself into her schoolwork during her father's deployment. However, she cautioned that for other students, the opposite can also occur. Some students may have a lot of difficulty focusing on their schoolwork when a parent is deployed half a world away. As Kaitlyn so well put it, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to coping with the stress of deployment. I am proud of Katie and Kaitlyn for their courage, their resilience, and their powerful articulation of a message that I hope everyone hears. We owe our military families an enduring debt of gratitude for everything they have done. We should do everything we can to ensure that no family feels isolated or left out or endures the silent suffering Katie described. I hope every American, as we approach Veterans Day, will actively support our military families, and do what we can to make our communities more welcoming and supportive in accommodating their needs. As Veterans Day approaches, let's celebrate our military families and recognize their extraordinary contributions. Let us thank not only our service men and women but also the spouses, children, and other family members who have shared in the sacrifice of military service. We should also remember the families of our civilian and intelligence servicemembers deployed in danger and away from their families around the world. In concluding, I wish to also express my strong support for the bipartisan legislation the Senate is considering to boost employment opportunities for veterans. Unemployment has been disproportionally high among veterans and we must act now. The last thing our returning service men and women need is to have to face an unemployment line. I urge my colleagues to swiftly pass this much needed legislation, which I am very proud to cosponsor. I yield the floor.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2012/mar/02/sheldon-whitehouse/us-sen-sheldon-whitehouse-says-rhode-island-has-se/,Politics,Polifact
21704,Santiam Correctional Institution: Plan to close prison to save money doesn't add up,"By Ken Allen AFSCME Council 75 represents the workers in the vast majority of the state corrections facilities in Oregon. Our members work hard to protect the public, while working with inmates incarcerated in 13 prisons throughout the state. While the majority of our members are corrections officers, we also represent counselors, dentists, food service workers, nurses, maintenance and clerical workers, among others. These jobs are tough, stressful and sometimes dangerous. The Oregon Legislature and governor are currently considering how to close a $340 million budget hole because tax revenues are less than expected when forecast last May. Part of a budget deal announced on the first day of this year's legislative session would close the Santiam Correctional Institution southeast of Salem. The estimated savings after closure in June would be $1.6 million. The governor and the Legislature should reconsider this plan. The closure plan and the numbers don't add up. The closure is a knee-jerk reaction to a real budget problem. The Santiam Correctional Institution holds 440 inmates. It is a minimum-security facility. Typically, minimum-security facilities are the cheapest to operate, followed by medium-security, with maximum-security facilities at the highest cost per inmate. The legislative plan is to release none of the 440 inmates, but ship them to other prisons throughout Oregon. Under the current plan, 50 percent of these minimum-security inmates would be then imprisoned in a higher-cost medium-security facility. All the 440 inmates would be pushed into an already overcrowded prison system. We have 395 inmates pushed into triple-bunked cells intended for two inmates and bunked in classrooms and areas supposed to be designated for inmate labor. We have units that were designated for 80 inmates with 120 inmates, with only one corrections officer supervising these inmates. We have units with blind spots, including no sightline to the bathroom, with only one corrections officer supervising 80 to 100 inmates. The plan to send 440 more inmates into an overcrowded system would create dangerous and hazardous work for our members and the inmates. Prison overcrowding leads to assaults on staff and other inmates and to lawsuits. The Department of Corrections believes it would have to reopen the facility 12 to 18 months later because of inmate population growth. The leadership of this union is opposed to the closure of the Santiam facility. Department leadership has asked legislators to let them find the $1.6 million of cuts in the budget of the whole department. Legislators should do their jobs to monitor budget needs, but none of them has ever even run a prison. Let the managers and workers at the Department of Corrections put together a plan to save $1.6 million. Don't close the Santiam Correctional Institution.

Under the direction of the University System of New Hampshire Board of Trustees and New Hampshire Public Television Board of Directors, NHPTV is taking the following actions to address the elimination of its state funding: Eliminating 20 full-time positions,  Reducing staff salaries by between 4% - 10% (with management taking the largest reduction), Reducing the stations 403(b) staff retirement plan contribution to 1%, Cancelling dozens of contracts and services, and Reducing the stations Educational Engagement services.In addition to the above measures, NH Outlook and Granite State Challenge, two locally focused programs produced by NHPTV, will be placed on hiatus until additional funding is secured. A small production staff will continue to produce NHPTVs award-winning program Windows to the Wild on a reduced schedule, as well as other grant-funded documentaries and specials. National PBS programs and other viewer favorites will remain part of NHPTVs broadcast schedule. NHPTV will continue to operate from its broadcast center in Durham, NH. For more than 50 years, NHPTV has been New Hampshires only locally owned and operated statewide television network. The station is a licensee of the University System of New Hampshire, which has been responsible for disseminating its state funding. The University System is facing a budget cut of more than 45% in its state appropriation, which is one of the highest proposed cuts nationwide on a system that already ranks 50th in terms of per capita state support. Given these financial constraints, the University System will not be in a position to financially assist NHPTV. NHPTV President and CEO Peter Frid expressed his deep regret and disappointment in having to lay off staff members because of the elimination of state funding. Our employees are talented, dedicated and believe in the mission of public broadcasting, Frid said. The NHPTV board and I thank each of them for their many years of outstanding service. Employees who lose their jobs will receive a severance package and outplacement support.NHPTV Board Chair Mark Collin noted, The Board wants to assure viewers, volunteers, supporters and staff that despite this devastating loss of funding, NHPTV and public broadcasting will be preserved in New Hampshire. Also, NHPTV will continue to seek operational efficiencies.

21787,"Senators McEachin, Barker Respond to Gov. McDonnells State of the Commonwealth Address","Great response by Senators McEachin and Barker to Gov. McDonnells budget. The bottom line, according to McEachin and Barker: we are concerned that aspects of the budget Governor McDonnell has put forth will damage Virginia and our economy by cutting hundreds of millions from public education and critical initiatives for children and families. Senators Barker and McEachin expressed Democrats desire to keep doing things the Virginia Way, putting problem-solving above partisan bickering. But both senators expressed grave concern with the deep cuts the Governor is proposing to public education, including cuts to Pre-Kindergarten programs and to cost-to-compete education funding, and with his desire to divert General Fund money, money which funds public education, to pay for transportation projects. (Richmond, VA) Newly-elected Senate Democratic Caucus Chair Donald McEachin (D-Henrico) and Senator George Barker (D-Fairfax) delivered the Democratic response to the State of the Commonwealth Address this evening, calling for both parties to come together to protect funding for our public schools. Senator McEachin: Good evening, Im Senator Donald McEachin, Chair of the Senate Democrats. Senator Barker: And Im Senator George Barker. Were happy to be with you to discuss our future as Virginians. We have challenges. We have opportunities. And, most important of all, we have responsibilities. Governor McDonnell presented some lofty goals tonight. We embrace challenges and will work with the Governor, Republicans in the legislature, and all Virginians to meet many of them. Two years ago we adopted a bold plan to restore Virginias pension system to fiscal health. We are pleased that the Governors proposed budget restores funding as promised, honoring our commitment to teachers and State employees. Over the past decade, under Governors Warner, Kaine, and McDonnell, Virginia has received many accolades: Best State for Business, Best Managed State, Best State for Children. We have achieved such recognition by working together, Democrats and Republicans, in the interest of all Virginians. Although our economy struggled recently, Virginia has done far better than most states, with unemployment well below the national rate. Over the past two years, we have partnered with the Governor and our Republican colleagues to help create more jobs in Virginia. We worked with Governor McDonnell to increase funding and improve targeting of money to bring businesses and investment to Virginia. We have put your interests and problem-solving before partisan bickering. Over the last several years we cut 6 billion dollars and balanced the budget without raising taxes. We also did it without decimating support for education, public safety, and services for children, the elderly, and those with disabilities. We look forward to working with the governor to pass a budget that is best for all Virginians. But we are concerned that aspects of the budget Governor McDonnell has put forth will damage Virginia and our economy by cutting hundreds of millions from public education and critical initiatives for children and families. Rather than making such cuts, we should be meeting our legal and moral responsibilities to our children and families. In the past Virginia has met many needs with limited state funds by partnering with local non-profit agencies. However, the Governors budget would eliminate funding for teen pregnancy prevention programs and centers protecting victims of child abuse, and slash support for free clinics and community health centers, among others. We and our children need these programs. Particularly short-sighted are cuts to pre-Kindergarten programs that put disadvantaged children on a path to success. These programs serve children who need to catch up to their peers before starting kindergarten. Studies have shown that children who come to kindergarten well-prepared are more likely to graduate high school, have higher earnings, and are less likely to be arrested. We all have an interest in continuing Virginias tradition of investing in our children. The governor is also short-changing our kids by proposing to eliminate so called cost-to-compete money for our local school districts. This fund allows our localities to keep the best and the brightest school personnel here in Virginia, instead of losing them to higher paying states. This amounts to a nearly 65 million dollar cut to Northern Virginia schools alone. And now Id like to re-introduce Senator Donald McEachin. Senator McEachin: Overall in this, his first budget, the governor is cutting Pre-K and K through 12 public education by hundreds of millions of dollars. His proposal to take more sales tax revenue to fund transportation is perhaps where we have our strongest disagreement. Governor McDonnells program would take 110 million dollars out of the General Fund, which is money that pays for our schools. And taking money from education is a terrible approach to transportation funding. The governor needs to work on a real long-term solution to funding transportation instead of treating public education as a piggy bank to be raided. Taking money out of our classrooms to pave roads doesnt help build Virginias future. It doesnt help our children and it doesnt solve our transportation problem. We also oppose another Republican pet project, giving big corporations tax breaks for donations to private schools. We need to educate all of our children, not just the select few who can afford private schools. We strongly believe taxpayer dollars should be used for public education, not for rich private academies. Weakening our public schools will not only hurt our childrens ability to compete in a cut-throat global economy, but also will make our state a less attractive place to do business. Last year, as in several years past, Virginia was named the Best State for Business. We earned that title for a variety of reasons, including education, a category in which received one of the highest ratings. Businesses will choose to come here if they know their employees families will be happy and their children will get a good education. We want to be a first choice for businesses so we can offer good-paying and numerous jobs. This past November the voters of the Commonwealth elected 20 Democrats and 20 Republicans to the Senate, so to pass a budget we need to work together. We will work with the governor and with senators and delegates of both parties toward putting Virginia on the right track to economic growth, but we will not agree to short-changing our children and our future. Short-term band-aids are not a real solution to problems. Public education, transportation, a well-run and efficient state government-these are important priorities and all of them will determine whether Virginia is a state that leads the country with a robust economy in the next decade, or whether we fall behind. We have obligations to future generations, and I hope we can all keep that in mind this session. So I say tonight to the governor and his party, we share many of the same goals; lets work together to make progress this session. That is what the people of this great commonwealth voted for and thats what they deserve. Thank you, and God bless the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2012/jan/26/donald-mceachin/mceachin-says-gov-mcdonnells-budget-cuts-public-ed/,Politics,Polifact

22066,The First Order of Business,"The First Order of Business Remarks by Mike McCabe at the 10th Annual Fighting Bob Fest Posted: September 19, 2011 Updated: September 20, 2011 These are weird times. Its not every year a state Supreme Court justices throat makes its way into another justices hands. And its not every year you see 100,000 people protesting on the Capitol Square. Or nine recall elections in one summer. WDC Executive Director Mike McCabes Remarks On The Earth Productions Video courtesy of A symbol of the weirdness thats burned into memory: The inflatable palm trees demonstrators were carrying during the height of the mass protests to poke fun at the Fox News coverage. How weird is it that a national news network showed its audience footage of protesters resorting to violence in Wisconsin and there were palm trees swaying in the background? How weird is it that when millions of Americans are looking for real news and some honest-to-goodness truth telling about whats going on in the country, they tune in to Comedy Central? Now I read in the newspaper that there are rural towns in Wisconsin that are tearing up their paved roads and putting down gravel instead. I grew up on a farm on a dirt road in Clark County , and we always saw paved roads as a sign of progress. Now were going backward. That wouldnt be so weird if state money for road construction had been cut by 15%. But theres a 15% increase in the state budget for road building. Those in charge at the Capitol just dont want the local town road crews to have any of it. They want it all to go to the private contractors who make all the campaign donations. These are weird times. I dont want you to take this the wrong way. And I sure dont want my wife to take this the wrong way. But I was lying in bed last night thinking about Tommy Thompson. How weird is that? Here youve got a guy who became Republican leader in the Assembly some time shortly after his birth, and went on to become a four-term Republican governor. Yet now the Club for Growth says Mr. Republican cant belong to the club anymore. Hes not conservative enough. Not extreme enough. Theyre running ads saying Thompsons not a real right-winger. So Mr. Republican has to respond by saying thats a malicious lie and insisting that he really is enough of a wacko to belong to the club. These are weird times. Amid the weirdness, its important to remember this. We gather here today on the 100th anniversary of the most amazing legislative session in Wisconsin history. Maybe the greatest in American history. In that 1911 session, the Wisconsin legislature created the nations first workers compensation system. Sweeping railroad regulations were enacted. Insurance industry reform and the establishment of a state life insurance plan. The first progressive income tax. Vocational and technical education systems were started. Historic blows for worker rights, as maximum work hours for women and children were set. What happened in 1911 was no accident. It happened because of what was done years earlier. In 1897, bribery, illegal voting and election fraud were outlawed. In 1905 donations and election spending by corporations were banned. These actions were the foundation upon which the 1911 session of the legislature was built. Think about it. Wisconsin became a state in 1848. Bribery was outlawed in 1897. Bribing a public official was perfectly legal for the first half century of statehood. Then it was criminalized. Now its legal again. The bribes are now called campaign contributions and independent expenditures and issue ads. There used to be poll taxes and later they were outlawed. Now theyve brought them back, masquerading as a requirement that voters have a photo ID in order to cast a ballot. Criminal rackets have long required the payment of protection money. How is what wealthy interests are doing in the political arena any different? Just look at whats happening to wind power projects in Wisconsin . Oil and gas interests invested vast sums in the election of Scott Walker. The Koch brothers alone spent more than $1 million to put him in office. Real estate and construction interests, also lobbying to block wind energy development, put $1.2 million behind Walker s campaign. Since becoming governor, Walker has deep-sixed close to a dozen wind energy development projects. Ask anyone in this room . . . hell, ask anyone in the state if they think its a good idea for America to become more independent of foreign oil. Ask anyone if they think developing alternative energy sources makes sense. Youll almost universally get a resounding yes for an answer. Yet Wisconsin is erecting all kinds of barriers to wind energy development. Why? Because those who want to keep us addicted to oil paid protection money. Road builders made Scott Walker the number one recipient of their campaign contributions. They wanted $800 million in federal rail funds to go to crumbling roads instead. Walker and his allies threw away the $800 million. Other states got our money. Why? Because interests who want to keep us in cars paid protection money. Yet were seeing a return to dirt roads in rural areas of our state as rural towns rip up their pavement and put down gravel instead. Why? Because the private road contractors paid protection money and got the state to send all the construction money to them, not the local townships road repair crews. Call it vending machine politics. Toll booth democracy. Some call it a fancy word  plutocracy  that hardly anyone knows. Some want to use the F word even though its fruitless because next to no one distinguishes between early-onset fascism and the late-stage form that involves gas chambers and that kind of thing. Call it what it is . . . a criminal enterprise. It is a crime that the richest 1% of Americans have more wealth than bottom 95% combined and that the 400 richest have a bigger net worth than half of all Americans collectively. And it is a crime that the top 1% has been able to buy tax and economic policies that have led to such injustice. It is a crime that $800 million for rail development was thrown away and rural communities are returning to dirt roads, all to keep the private road builders happy. It is a crime that public officials keep saying yes to the old economies of oil and gas and asphalt and concrete and no to new economies like green energy. It is a crime that Wisconsin has seen the biggest cuts in education in the nation. It is a crime that no public health insurance option was debated much less voted on in Congress. It is a crime that Wall Street has proven too big to jail. It is a crime that we have pay-per-view congressmen who make people pay to attend a town hall meeting. There is a criminal syndicate behind most all criminal enterprises. Modern day politics is no different. To control what people read, see and hear, those in power created their own media organizations to spread their propaganda. Big ones like Fox News. Small ones like Wisconsin Reporter. To control elections, they turned them into auctions, effectively taking the r out of free speech and making sure front groups of their making do most all of the talking. They brought back poll taxes. Once the elections are over and attention turns to lawmaking, they have their bill mills like the American Legislative Exchange Council, better known as ALEC, to draft model legislation that is pedaled to state lawmakers across the country. And to defend the laws they write against legal challenge, theyve stacked the courts. What used to be the third branch of government is now an extension of the other two. What used to be a check on the power of the executive and legislative branches is now a rubber stamp. Look no further for evidence than the assault on worker rights in Wisconsin . When a lower-court judge ruled that the law abolishing most collective bargaining rights was illegally passed because the Legislature failed to follow the open meetings law, a state Supreme Court justice ruled that the judge was wrong to rely on laws that apply to the Legislature except when the Legislature says they do not. They built this juggernaut with boatloads of money, of course. But they also had a carefully conceived plot and a gift for public relations. Have you ever noticed that whatever they plan to do they accuse their opponents of doing first? When they set out to create a vast propaganda network masquerading as legitimate news organizations, they first spent years screaming MEDIA BIAS! When they wanted to bring back poll taxes and otherwise rig elections, they first incessantly squealed VOTER FRAUD! Before launching a three-decade long class war, systematically dismantling progressive taxation and cementing in place economic policies that led to massive transfers of wealth from the poor and middle class to our societys most affluent, they met every plea for social and economic justice with the screeching condemnation CLASS WARFARE! When they plotted to legislate from the bench and reinterpret the First Amendment to remove the r from free speech, they first shouted JUDICIAL ACTIVISM! umpteen times and branded moderate and liberal judges alike judicial activists. All I can say is that if they ever start accusing their opponents of backing socialized castration, watch your flies men! This is going to sound funny, but to combat this madness the first order of business cant be tax or economic policy, it cant be holding Wall Street to account, it cant be health care, it cant be education, it cant be climate change or clean air & water. You cant tackle the jobs problem, the budget problem, the tax problemwithout tackling the first problem  money in politics. It is corrupt. It is institutionally corrupt. I am not the first person to say this. Would you believe that I am quoting a Republican presidential candidate? A current GOP candidate? Our state and our country have been run off the rails. If we are to get back on track, the first order of business needs to be recriminalizing bribery. Doing away with the new poll tax. Restoring our democracy. To set the stage for this years Fighting Bob Fest, Ed Garvey asked Bob Festers if it is time to start a third party. I know if Jim Hightower were here right now, he would crack wise and say that hed settle for two. Im holding out for one thats worth a damn. If there is to be any party building movement, it needs to focus on creating a first party, not a third. We need at least one party that isnt hopelessly beholden to the less than 1% of the population that makes all the campaign contributions but rather works for the other 99% of us. And you all have to come to terms with the fact that the Republicans couldnt have done what they did in Wisconsin this year unless Democrats did what they did a year ago or two or 10. The Republican Party would not have become what it has without Democrats becoming what they are. When wackos are in charge, the last thing on earth that is needed is a bunch of weenies as the alternative. As was the case in late 1800s and early 1900s  in Fighting Bobs time  the question is not which shall rule, Democrats or Republicans? Its which shall rule, wealth or people? If you are a high school student, I have one word of advice for you. If you are a little older, I have one word of advice to share with your children and grandchildren. The future of our state and our nation depend on it. Pharmaceuticals. We need some smart young person to invent a miracle pill  a sort of Viagra for the spine. And we need to persuade progressive politicians to take it. Then if you see politicians with stiff spines and erect posture lasting more than 4 hours, you need to call the Capitol switchboard at once and tell them to take more pills. Until those magic pills kick in, I leave you with this thought. Only a crisis  actual or perceived  produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That, I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes politically inevitable. These are not normal times. Things are so freaking messed up Im lying in bed thinking about Tommy Thompson and quoting Milton Friedman. But this much I am sure of . . . . If the right ideas are going to be lying around when the politically impossible becomes politically inevitable, you and I cannot be lying around now. This no time for moping. No time for despair. No time for throwing our hands into the air. This is a time to hope and a time to dream. This is a time to listen and learn. A time to think and teach. To plot and plan. To speak and tweet and network. To organize and boycott. And march. And vote. If we do these things, the history we are celebrating today will repeat itself.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/oct/02/mike-mccabe/campaign-money-critic-mike-mccabe-says-cash-strapp/,Politics,Polifact
22079,Rick Perry to Newsmax: I Regret 'Heartless' Comment on Immigration,"Presidential candidate Rick Perry on Wednesday apologized for saying that anyone who opposed giving tuition breaks to the children of illegal immigrants did not have a heart.In an exclusive interview with Newsmax.TV, the Texas governor said he had made a poor choice of words during the Sept. 22 presidential debate, but he stood by his view that the decision in his state to extend tuition breaks was the right one.I was probably a bit over-passionate by using that word and it was inappropriate, Perry admitted. In Texas in 2001 we had 181 members of the legislature  only four voted against this piece of legislation  because it wasnt about immigration it was about education.During the wide-ranging interview, Perry: Opposed the idea of a fence stretching the entire length of the Mexican border; Repeated his claim that social security is a Ponzi scheme, saying its so bad it would make Bernie Madoff blush; Attacked challenger Mitt Romney as a flip-flopper; Accused President Barack Obama of sending government agencies to go to war against business, and; Said most voters want their president to be a person of faith.Perry said a fence stretching the entire length of the Mexican border would be expensive, ineffective and would trample on property rights.However he wants what he calls strategic fences in urban areas combined with more border agents and eye-in-the-sky planes to beam down real-time information on suspect activity.In the metropolitan areas where the fencing actually can play a positive role, absolutely, he said. But you have to have boots on the ground.I cannot overstress how important it is to have that law enforcement presence that can immediately move to an area where you are seeing activity because you have got the aviation assets in the air, thats how you secure the border.But having an obstacle without observation is no obstacle at all. So just the idea of building a fence and saying, That will take care of it, lets just build a fence, has never worked in the history of mankind.Perry said that his decade-long tenure in the Governors Mansion in Austin has given him a unique perspective on the immigration issue. Nobody has dealt with this issue more than I have, he said.As Texas governor, a border governor, you have to deal with these issue, you cant just talk about them and say, Oh, lets build a wall from Brownsville to El Paso and that will take care of it. We have to live with reality.But he said the biggest immigration issue is the failure of the federal government to uphold its constitutional duty to secure the border.We wouldnt be having these conversations today, whether its about in-state tuition for illegal immigrants or whether its the Arizona law or whether its voter-ID which we passed in Texas, or sanctuary cities and the banning of those None of those would come up if the federal government had simply done its job through the years to secure our borders.Perry is leading the race for the Republican nomination for the presidency in the opinion polls despite perceived poor performances in a series of debates. He again took the opportunity to attack his nearest challenger, Mitt Romney for flip-flopping on the issue of healthcare. Perry said that President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law was patterned on the bill Romney signed into law when he was governor of Massachusetts.In his book, he said  I want to do what I did for Massachusetts for the rest of the country, said Perry. He took that line out of his paperback thats in publication today, so again, another one of those flip-flops from the governor of Massachusetts.When he finds that something he believes in strongly is not acceptable in the political arena in todays presidential race, he tries to change his tune.He said a repeal of Obamacare is the highest calling for whoever is the next president, although he hoped that the Supreme Court will have ruled it unconstitutional well before the next inauguration. He said the incoming administration should then transition into a program where the states play a substantially greater role, where Medicaid is block-granted back to the states and they have the ability to come up with various innovative ways with menus of ideas of how to deliver healthcare to the people of their states.Thats the way to not only get the budgetary side of this under control but actually to deliver healthcare to more people in more thoughtful and more innovative ways.On social security, Perry said that seniors and those nearing retirement have nothing to worry about. The program that has historically been in place will be in place for them, he said.He attacked members of both parties for trying to scare seniors by saying they would lose their social security payments. That is very immature from my perspective, he said.Americans want answers, they want straight-speaking, truth-telling individuals working for them and thats what Ive done.Kids know, 25-36 year-olds, they know that social security, if they keep paying into the program that weve got today, it would make Bernie Madoff blush. This is a Ponzi scheme for them.He said possible solutions include allowing people to take their accounts and put their money in the market, staggering the age upward for when people can collect and giving states more say.The states could play a more active role in dealing with social security for their state employees and/or their retirees  obviously not for the general population, he said. ""In my book I talked about three counties in Texas that had taken advantage of opting out of social security and today Brazoria, Matagorda and Galveston counties all see substantially higher payments to their retirees than had they stayed in the social security program.""Perry attacked the Obama administration for the explosion in regulations that he said were hurting the economy.I really believe in the free market and one of the problems that weve got in this country is government sticking their nose into way too many areas that frankly the private sector will work its way through and the marketplace will work its way through.There is agency after agency in Washington D.C that have basically been loosed to go to war against job creators in this country and that is one of the things, as president, that I will do. We will pull back all these regulations and rein in these agencies that are running looseherd over the private citizens and the job creators in this country.On energy, Perry accused Obama of trying to make America look like Europe with high gas prices caused by a failure to develop our own resources.This administration does have an energy policy, he said. It is to make our country more dependent upon foreign sources of oil. That is bad for America economically, its bad for America strategically.That is his plan for energy prices to skyrocket so that America looks more like Europe. I dont want America to look more like Europe.Perry, who has led much-attended prayer rallies in Texas, also talked quite openly about his faith during the interview. He was asked about comments made by the Rev. Franklin Graham, who told Newsmax in one exclusive interview that he believes Obama discriminates against Christians while showing undue favoritism toward Muslims.Graham was banned last year by the Obama administration from a Pentagon prayer gathering for the National Day of Prayer.Perry, who hosted a highly controversial prayer rally called The Response shortly before jumping into the presidential race, said that Americans overwhelmingly want a religious presence in the White House.The president of the United States should be a person of faith and not be afraid to stand up and talk about the values that they believe in their heart, he said.Those Judeo-Christian values that this country was based upon are still very important to the vast majority of the people of this country. They want to see those exhibited both in word and in deed.Perry also attacked the administrations foreign policy as muddled, saying the United States should always stand by its allies, especially Israel. Israels not perfect but they are a friend and we should send message after message that if you attack Israel, you attack America.Our allies dont know whether were going to be standing with them or not, he added, mentioning the decision not to sell the newest weaponry to Taiwan and India for fear of offending China and Pakistan.We need to clearly send a message, were going to be there for our allies in those regions of the world. India had to go to France to buy the fighters that they needed  bad message.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2011/sep/28/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-only-four-texas-lawmakers-opposed-/,Politics,Polifact
22121,About George Allen  GeorgeAllen.com,"Family. Faith. Freedom. Football. The Four Fs have shaped George Allens entire life. The son of an NFL coach, George Allen learned early on it was family that would always serve as the one constant in a life filled with ups and downs, hirings and firings, and moving. These days, he sees husband and father as his most rewarding titles. Hes been married to Susan for twenty-five years. Together they have raised their three children  Tyler, Forrest, and Brooke  sending them to public schools while living all over Virginia in the Charlottesville area, Richmond, Chesterfield, and currently in Mount Vernon. Like other parents, they are watching them learn in middle school, head off to college or even enter the world with a degree ready to tackle the exciting challenges ahead. George grew up in a football family with grace before supper and seeing the concept and importance of faith instilled in all the teams his father coached. From having the Redskins chaplain, Tom Skinner, provide the invocation when he was sworn in as the Commonwealth of Virginias 67th Governor to continuing to work with local pastors as they serve their communities, George has not lost sight of those guiding principles he learned growing up. George Allen is fond of telling how the two greatest influences in his life were his parents. His mother grew up in Tunisia where she experienced the oppressive and terrifying Axis occupation during WWII. It was from his mother that he learned the concept and blessings of Freedom. Its a concept that would shape his life and help instruct his political philosophy and beliefs. George started his professional career as a law clerk in Southwest Virginia for beloved conservative Judge Glen M. Williams. The lessons he learned from Judge Williams and the time he spent in Abingdon continue to impact his appreciation for the rule of law to this day. A self-described Common Sense Jeffersonian Conservative, George had the distinction of holding Thomas Jeffersons seat in the Virginia General Assembly. As Governor he put into practice many of the ideas and concepts that he worked on while serving in Mr. Jeffersons seat. Sworn in as Governor in 1994, George set about to bring sweeping reform that would make Virginia a national model in economic development, public safety, education accountability, welfare reform, and creative government. He challenged critics and sentiment that suggested it couldnt be done, reining in government spending and substantially reducing the size of the state workforce. And he accomplished his reform agenda with bi-partisan support. Elected to the U.S. Senate in 2000, George continued to advocate for Virginias families. He advocated for the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts that spurred opportunities for more job creation and created the Competitive Caucus to keep America the world capital of innovation. George was one of about a dozen Senators to vote against the Bridge to Nowhere. He strove to make Congress live like families do  within its means  by introducing and advocating for real budget reform including a balanced budget amendment, line item veto, and a paycheck penalty for Members of Congress when they fail to pass appropriations bills on time. Since leaving the U.S. Senate George has continued to advocate for the issues and ideas he has always fought for. He launched the American Energy Freedom Center, whose mission is to advocate positive ideas for American jobs, economic prosperity and promote increased freedom, opportunity, and competition in the development and use of our vast energy resources. George also serves as the Reagan Ranch Presidential Scholar for the Young Americas Foundation. Ronald Reagan  one of Georges other political influences  can be credited for getting George involved in politics when Governor Reagan asked him to lead Young Virginians for Reagan in 1976. Football has always been a central part of George Allens life. And he lived it watching his father coach growing up. He played it at the University of Virginia where he holds a degree with distinction in History, as well as a law degree. George firmly believes sports is a meritocracy that rewards earned success, teamwork, preparation, competitiveness, perseverance, innovative leadership and hard work  and shows how our government ought to live by some of these principles and characteristics. In his recently released book, What Washington Can Learn from the World of Sports, he presents solutions that can work to put people across America in a position to compete and succeed in achieving their dreams.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2011/sep/12/george-allen/allen-says-he-reined-state-spending-governor/,Politics,Polifact
22186,Cut Cap and Balance Act,"Despite our nations staggering $14.4 trillion debt, there are many Members of the U.S. House and Senate who want to raise our nations debt limit without making permanent reforms in our fiscal policies. We believe that this is a fiscally irresponsible position that would place America on the Road to Ruin. At the same time, we believe that the current debate over raising the debt limit provides a historic opportunity to focus public attention, and then public policy, on a path to a balanced budget and paying down our debt. We believe that the Cut, Cap, Balance plan for substantial spending cuts in FY 2012, a statutory spending cap, and Congressional passage of a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution is the minimum necessary precondition to raising the debt limit. The ultimate goal is to get us back to a point where increases in the debt limit are no longer necessary. If you agree, take the Cut, Cap, Balance Pledge! There are versions for elected officials, federal candidates and ordinary citizens. Thanks to Pop Minute TV and our other media partners for the coverage. THE PLEDGE I pledge to urge my Senators and Member of the House of Representatives to oppose any debt limit increase unless all three of the following conditions have been met: Cut - Substantial cuts in spending that will reduce the deficit next year and thereafter. Cap - Enforceable spending caps that will put federal spending on a path to a balanced budget. Balance - Congressional passage of a Balanced Budget Amendment to the U.S. Constitution -- but only if it includes both a spending limitation and a super-majority for raising taxes, in addition to balancing revenues and expenses.

22279,First-term Assembly Republicans drove history-making changes,"The bumper crop of new Assembly Republicans - 27 of the 59 Assembly Republicans are serving their first terms - played a decisive role in the history made in the Capitol over the past six months. On March 10, they provided 24 of the 53 Assembly votes for first-term Republican Gov. Scott Walker's bill that all but eliminated collective bargaining for most public employees and weakened their unions. Despite massive Capitol protests, threats and needing State Patrol escorts out of the Capitol, first-term Assembly Republicans did not waver in their support for Walker's changes. They also all voted for Walker's 2011-'13 budget, which cut aid to public schools, local governments, the University of Wisconsin System and technical colleges and took tax-credit money from poor single parents. Democrats say those votes will cost many of the new Republicans their jobs in November 2012 elections. There's a saying in the Capitol: First-term lawmakers are most vulnerable. If they aren't beaten when they seek a second term, the odds are they will be in office a long time. That's why past first-term lawmakers who have been protested, forced to take difficult votes that angered special-interest groups and who get ""you're a one-termer"" taunts, have often nervously searched for face-saving compromises and tiptoed away from their campaign promises. That wasn't true for these first-term Assembly Republicans. They adopted a different response: ""Bring it on."" ""I signed up for exactly this,"" Republican Rep. Michelle Litjens, of Oshkosh, said in a WisconsinEye interview last week. ""I wanted to fundamentally change government in the state of Wisconsin."" ""We all expected we were coming into something really, really rough,"" added GOP Rep. Roger Rivard, of Rice Lake, whose district had been represented by a Democrat for 26 years. ""I knew it was going to be rough, because - apparently - we went down this (spending) road for many, many years and they didn't have the courage to do it,"" Rivard added. Who are these 27 first-term Republicans? They are overwhelmingly male (only three of the 27 are female). Their average age is 44; two of them are in their 20s, and nine are in their 50s or older. Their pre-Assembly jobs vary widely, although many have a small-business background. They include four certified public accountants, a physician, a veterinarian, a dairy farmer and a founding member of an oldies-style music and entertainment group. Although Democratic lawmakers often work in government - and often in the Capitol - before being elected to the Legislature, that is true of only one first-term Assembly Republican. The leader of Assembly Republicans, Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald, said the toughness displayed by first-term Assembly Republicans was a big reason his caucus stayed united. ""You had freshmen standing up that are in swing districts that said, 'You know what? I didn't come down here to be re-elected again. I came down here to set the state right, and that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to take this vote; I know it's probably not the easiest politically for me,' "" Fitzgerald said, adding: ""That was the beauty - the political courage - of it, that these folks were like, 'I'll take this vote and, if I don't come back, I can look myself in the mirror and say, 'That's what I went down there to do and that's what I think the people sent me there to do.' "" But Assembly Democratic Leader Peter Barca said some of those Republicans took votes that will cost them their jobs. ""Freshman Republicans have been unexpectedly very quiet this session,"" Barca said in a statement. ""Their role appears to be largely following their legislative leadership as they all rubber-stamp Gov. Walker's agenda."" ""Given that many of them ran as being independent and vowing to shake things up at the Capitol to their tea party base, it is a surprise"" that they stayed united, Barca said. ""They voted in lock step"" with Republican Party leaders. Barca also said first-term Republicans ""voted to take funding away from their public schools in their districts to give it to private Milwaukee voucher schools"" and passed a budget that raided specific funds and raised taxes and fees, despite their campaign promises. Privately, Assembly Democrats say their top target next year is Republican Rep. Joe Knilans, who won the Assembly seat from look-for-the-union-label Janesville.

22625,"MPS could face $13.6 million shortfall, benefit rate still high","It's early in the budget season for Milwaukee Public Schools, but the administration said in a presentation Thursday that it could face a $13.6 million budget shortfall next year. Figures are preliminary because it's unclear what the state's budget will include for schools. But Chief Financial Officer Gerald Pace told a Milwaukee Board of School Directors' budget committee Thursday night that the end of the federal stimulus was partially responsible for the shortfall. The administration also reported its benefit rate for employees would drop from 74.2% to 69.9% in fiscal year 2012, a result of the new contracts with unions. School Board Director Larry Miller said he was surprised the health-care concessions the union agreed to didn't have a larger impact on the benefit rate. MPS Superintendent Gregory Thornton said he was also disappointed the rate hadn't dropped more significantly, but that the calculation was correct. Teachers' average salaries are increasing next year, from $56,500 to $59,500 in 2011-'12. When wages and benefits are combined, an average teacher will make $101,091 next year, said Budget Manager Deborah Wegner. Other components of the preliminary budget picture include: A plan to centralize budgets for guidance positions and long-term leave situations Changing how early childhood 3-year-old programs are funded Trimming 4-year-old kindergarten aide positions What to do about the loss of funding for a class-size reduction program in kindergarten through third grades. According to MPS, 27 schools may lose the program. That original number was 28, but one school shifted around its funding to solve the problem, according to the administration. School Board Director Terry Falk said the budget committee will meet again March 3 to discuss the impact of the governor's budget. The administration is scheduled to release its proposed budget on April 26. A series of public hearings will be held after that in May.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/04/maciver-institute/maciver-institute-says-average-annual-salary-and-b/,Politics,Polifact
22656,Caller posing as major GOP contributor dupes Walker,"Madison  Scott Walker took a prank phone call Tuesday, and Wisconsin learned a lot about its new governor. A recording of the call released Wednesday spelled out Walker's strategies for dealing with protesting union workers and trying to lure Democrats boycotting the state Senate back to Wisconsin. Speaking with whom he believed to be billionaire conservative activist David Koch, Walker said he considered - but rejected - planting troublemakers amid protesters who have rocked the Capitol for a week. He told the caller he feared a ""ruckus"" would ""scare the public into thinking maybe the governor has to settle to avoid this problem."" He also described a plan to get his bill taking away union rights passed without Democrats who have boycotted the Senate. He said he talked to a Democratic senator for 45 minutes who he thought could help even though ""he's not one of us."" Walker discussed ways Koch - a financer of the conservative group Americans for Prosperity - could help Republican legislators, presumably with TV and radio ads. Walker showed no indication on the tape he was aware the call was a prank. The 20-minute talk was actually with Ian Murphy, a blogger from Buffalo, N.Y., who edits the Buffalo Beast website. On the call, Walker likened his tough stance on the bill to former President Ronald Reagan successfully combating the air traffic controllers union three decades ago. ""That was the first crack in the Berlin Wall, in the fall of Communism, because from that point forward the Soviets and the Communists knew that Ronald Reagan wasn't a pushover,"" Walker said, according to the recording. In a Wednesday news conference, Walker said his remarks to the prank caller jibed with his public comments and downplayed the significance of the conversation. ""I take phone calls all the time,"" he said, noting he'd spoken with small-business people and average taxpayers. ""Now I'm not going to allow one crank phone call to be a distraction. The reality is we have a job to do. And the job is to debate this bill."" Walker's bill would balance this year's budget, repeal most union bargaining rights for public employees and give Walker's administration broad powers to reshape state health programs for the poor. It has sparked nonstop protests in the Capitol since last week from unions. They have said they are willing to give as much as Walker is asking in concessions on health care and pensions, but have demanded that he not take away most bargaining rights. Influential conservative Koch is co-owner of Koch Industries, an energy and consumer products company that owns Georgia-Pacific paper mills in Wisconsin. He is a philanthropist and a chief backer of Americans for Prosperity, which helped stage tea party rallies in Wisconsin in 2009 and 2010 and on Wednesday announced it was spending $342,200 on advertising to persuade Wisconsin residents to back Walker's plan. ""The caller was not David Koch and we have no further response to this fraudulent act at this time,"" said a statement from Mark Holden, a senior vice president with Koch Industries. Koch Industries' political action committee was one of the biggest financial supporters of Walker's gubernatorial campaign last fall, giving $43,000 to his political fund. Koch also gave $1 million to the Republican Governors Association last year, and Koch Industries contributed another $50,000. The RGA spent $65,000 on ads supporting Walker and an additional $3.4 million attacking Mayor Tom Barrett, Walker's Democratic opponent. On Tuesday, the RGA launched a website promoting Walker's stance against unions called StandWithScott.com. Walker has never spoken with Koch or his brother and business partner, Charles Koch, according to Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie. The sweeping budget-repair bill Walker is now pushing includes a clause that would allow this administration to sell 37 state-owned heating and power plants without taking bids - a provision sparking criticism that the plants could be sold to Koch Industries. A company official has said the firm has no interest in buying the plants, and Walker said the measure was not aimed at helping the company. ""Absolutely nothing to that - 100% wrong,"" Walker said in the news conference. He said he'd supported the idea of selling the plants back in the 1990s, when he was in the Assembly. He did not say why he wrote the bill to allow them to be sold without taking bids. ""We're going to have an open and accessible process,"" Walker said. The state Assembly began debating the budget-repair bill at noon Tuesday, and continued to do so late Wednesday. Action in the Senate has been stalled since Feb. 17, when all 14 Democrats went to Illinois. Twenty senators must be present to pass bills that spend money, and the Republicans have only 19 seats. Walker said during the call he would agree to speak with Democratic legislative leaders if all 14 senators return to Madison. He said he believes if Democrats return to the Capitol, the Senate would have a quorum and could approve the budget-repair bill - even if Democrats again left before the vote was called. ""Legally, we believe once they've gone into session, they don't physically have to be there"" at that point, Walker said. In response, Murphy said Walker should bring a baseball bat to the meeting with Senate Democrats. Walker laughed at the joke and noted he has a baseball bat in his office. ""I've got a (Louisville) Slugger with my name on it,"" he said. Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) said he found Walker's plan to ""trick"" Democrats disturbing and showed Democrats can't trust any overtures from Walker to talk. Walker said it wasn't a trick. Murphy suggested the idea of placing troublemakers amid the crowd of protesters. Walker responded: ""The only problem with that - because we thought about that. The problem with - my only gut reaction to that would be, right now the lawmakers I've talked to have just completely had it with them. The public is not really fond of this. ""My only fear is if there's a ruckus caused that would scare the public into thinking maybe the governor has to settle to avoid all these problems."" In the news conference, Walker said he considers many options presented by staff. ""As you've heard on the tape, we dismissed that and said that wasn't a good idea,"" Walker said. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau) said he never considered planting agitators in the crowd. He also said he'd never talked to Walker about the plan to bring Democrats back to Wisconsin and then have the Senate vote on the bill. Murphy asked how he could help Walker, and Walker said he wanted calls from the public to any wavering Republicans to continue. ""The more they get that reassurance, the easier it is for them to vote yes,"" Walker said. ""The other thing is more long term and that is that after this, the days and weeks and months ahead, particularly in these more swing areas, a lot of these guys - they don't necessarily need ads for them, but they are going to need a message out reinforcing why this is a good thing to do for the economy and a good thing to do for the state."" In the news conference, Walker said he was not talking about political campaigns when he discussed such a message. ""This isn't about a campaign,"" he said. ""It's about getting a message out about the truth."" The governor said in the call he spoke with Sen. Tim Cullen (D-Janesville) for 45 minutes on Saturday and he hopes the independent-minded lawmaker can influence his colleagues to return. Murphy said he would try calling Cullen, but Walker advised him not to because ""he's not one of us."" During the call, Walker sounded at ease as he talked of going on national TV and radio shows and conversing with other governors. At the end of the call, Murphy told Walker: ""Once you crush these bastards, I'll fly you out to (California) and really show you a good time."" Walker replied: ""All right. That would be outstanding."" Walker is the latest politician to be embarrassed when what he thought was a private conversation went public. Just before the 2008 presidential election, Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin took a call from a radio DJ posing as French President Nicolas Sarkozy. The Buffalo Beast's website was inaccessible much of Wednesday, apparently because so many people flooded the site. Murphy said he first spoke with Walker's chief of staff, Keith Gilkes. Murphy used the Internet service Skype to make the call and didn't have a return number to give Gilkes, so he made up a story about his maid dropping his phone in the washer. That gambit worked, and Murphy was connected with Walker when he called back at 2 p.m. Murphy wasn't surprised to learn Walker's office said he'd never talked to the real Koch. ""He did sound very thrilled to finally get the chance,"" Murphy said.

22662,Assemblys abrupt adjournment caps chaotic day in Capitol,"Madison - The Assembly teetered on the brink of chaos Friday evening but then adjourned peacefully after Republicans rescinded a vote on Gov. Scott Walker's budget-repair bill that the GOP lawmakers took without Democrats present. The high political drama came as the standoff on the politically charged bill dragged on, Democratic senators hid out in Illinois, a throng of tens of thousands demonstrated at the Capitol and national figures weighed in on the events. In fast-moving events Friday: Leaders of the state's biggest public worker unions said they would give in to the governor's demand for concessions on workers' benefits if Walker would give up his bid to repeal nearly all public union bargaining rights; Walker rejected that offer, saying government needed more flexibility in dealing with its employees; and the governor's address on the next two-year budget was delayed by a week. No clear exit from the chaos could be seen for either side. During the fourth straight day of demonstrations, the chanting, drumming and marching crowds of union supporters swelled to their largest numbers yet but remained peaceful, with no arrests or incidents reported. Meanwhile tea party groups from around the country planned a large counterdemonstration for Madison on Saturday. Wisconsin's fight over union rights plays out against a national backdrop as other states such as Ohio consider similar moves. In the Wisconsin Assembly on Friday, Republican leaders had called lawmakers to the floor at 5 p.m. to take up Walker's bill to fix a budget shortfall by cutting public worker benefits and bargaining rights. But they began business just before that hour, when Democrats were not yet on the floor. Democrats charged into the chamber and shouted to stop the action as Republican staff urged their leaders to ""keep going, keep going."" Republicans took the voice vote, putting the bill in a stage that prevented it from being amended in that house. Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca (D-Kenosha) called the move an ""illegal vote"" and demanded that Republicans rescind it. ""Unbelievable!"" Barca screamed. ""Unprecedented! Un-American! Not in keeping with the values of the state! You should be ashamed of yourselves."" Minutes later, Republicans agreed to effectively cancel the vote by allowing the bill to return to a stage in which Democrats can offer amendments. Democrats may have dozens of them, and the debate on the bill - whenever it happens - is expected to take hours. The Assembly adjourned until Tuesday. Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald (R-Horicon) said he started taking votes because he did not believe Democrats would show up. In the Senate, Democrats have blocked a vote since Thursday on the budget repair bill by leaving the state. ""I wanted to see if they were going to come to the floor,"" Fitzgerald said of Democrats. ""I had to force the issue, but obviously they did come."" In the Assembly galleries, union supporters erupted in cheers as that house adjourned without passing the bill. Fitzgerald said that the events were not a defeat and that he still has the votes to approve the bill. ""Democracy isn't pretty all the time,"" he said. In the Senate, his brother, Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau), also said he still has the votes he needs. ""If anything, what's going on in this building is galvanizing the (Republican) caucus,"" Fitzgerald said. Earlier Friday, Marty Beil, head of the Wisconsin State Employees Union, said his members would agree to pay more of their pension contributions and health insurance benefits as Walker is demanding. But Beil said his union would never agree to give up decades-old bargaining rights. Beil's union is part of AFSCME, the largest state and local employee union in Wisconsin, which represents 68,000 workers for the state, Milwaukee, Milwaukee County and other municipalities. An AFSCME spokesman said Beil was speaking for all the group's union locals in the state. ""We are prepared to implement the financial concessions proposed to help bring our state's budget into balance, but we will not be denied our God-given right to join a real union . . . we will not - I repeat we will not - be denied our rights to collectively bargain,"" Beil said in a statement. Mary Bell, the president of the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the state's largest teachers union, said her group also would make the financial concessions to keep its bargaining rights. ""This is not about money,"" Bell said in a phone conference. ""We understand the need to sacrifice."" No compromise seen Walker flatly rejected the offer. He said local governments and schools will need that flexibility with their employees to cope with cuts in their state aid that he wants to make to help balance the state budget. ""It doesn't work,"" Walker said of the offer in an interview. ""My goal all along has been to give all these folks - I asked for it in the past - the tools to control their own budgets . . . I know as a (former) local official, collective bargaining time and time again was the thing that stood in the way of local governments and school districts being able to manage their budgets."" During the interview, the thick walls of Walker's orderly office muted the thunderous shouts of demonstrators just a short distance away. Walker acknowledged getting little sleep through the demonstrations but looked unruffled and resolved. Walker pointed out that in December the state unions sought - unsuccessfully - to have Democrats then controlling the Legislature pass labor contracts that would have run through June. The no-pay-raise contracts would have included modest benefits concessions but would have also blocked for several months Walker's ability to reach the deeper cuts in benefits that he is seeking. ""Let's not kid ourselves. The reality is, it's about the money,"" Walker said. Also Friday, Walker delayed his address on the 2011-'13 budget bill until March 1. The governor had planned to deliver the speech Tuesday at a Madison manufacturer - a departure from past practice - but will now give the speech in the usual location, the state Assembly chambers. Democratic activist the Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. arrived in Madison on Friday to cheer the union crowds in speeches inside and outside the Capitol and denounce Republicans' actions. Sen. Fitzgerald responded that Jackson's appearance and recent comments by President Barack Obama on the budget standoff showed that Wisconsin has become a leader for states nationwide that are struggling with difficult budget deficits in the face of a prolonged economic downturn. At 9:30 on Friday morning, Republicans came to the floor and did a call for all senators to come to the floor. But for the second straight day, Democrats stayed in Illinois - a move that blocks a Senate vote on Walker's bill. Sen. Fitzgerald blasted Democrats for boycotting the Senate, saying he has barely had any contact with them. ""They won't call me back,"" he said. State troopers were sent to the Monona home of Senate Minority Leader Mark Miller to bring him to the Senate, but the Democrat wasn't there. ""My colleagues and I continue to work to stop state government from taking away rights from workers,"" Miller said in a statement. ""We continue to call on the governor and Republicans to allow us to get serious about addressing fiscal issues and creating jobs and drop the unrelated items that do nothing to help us balance our budget."" If troopers do find Democrats, they will not arrest them, Fitzgerald said. ""It's never going to happen, that's the point,"" Fitzgerald said. ""I don't know what the practical ability to force a senator to sit in their chair and vote (is)."" While the Assembly has adjourned until next week, the Senate can convene at a moment's notice if Democrats are found. Republicans did not say whether they would consider coming into session over the weekend. In an interview, Sen. Jim Holperin (D-Conover) said he and his Democratic Senate colleagues will be back. ""We won't obstruct the vote forever,"" Holperin said. ""We are within range of the Capitol if we need to be."" The Capitol Police said there were no incidents and no arrests Friday, but Republicans said they had security concerns amid what they considered a tense atmosphere. Sen. Randy Hopper (R-Fond du Lac), who has prisons employing many state workers in or near his district, said he had received threats such as ""I have a billy club and I will use it."" He said he had not received any death threats and would not be intimidated. After action ended in each house, law enforcement escorted Republican legislators out of the Capitol and through the crowds that demonstrated late into the night.

22773,Estate tax repeal among 18 bills Ohio House GOP introduces to advance agenda,"COLUMBUS, Ohio - The new Republican majority in the Ohio House of Representatives introduced a plan to repeal the Ohio estate tax on Tuesday, along with other bills to advance an agenda they say is focused on job creation. Of the 18 bills introduced Tuesday, some dealt directly with the economy while others sought to change laws regarding pit bulls and speeding tickets. Eliminating the estate tax, however, stood out for its broad support among Republicans, Gov. John Kasich and at least one House Democrat. ""Ben Franklin once quipped that only two things in life were certain: death and taxes,"" said Rep. Jay Hottinger, a Republican from Newark. ""I think even he didn't envision that the tax man would visit on the day of your death -- and that's something that needs to end here in the state of Ohio."" House Republicans said repealing the tax was only one piece of a broader plan to change the way state and local governments deliver services to Ohioans. ""In the days and weeks and short months ahead, how state government and how local government functions, what services are delivered, and how those services are delivered are going to be transformed unlike they have ever been in the history of the state of Ohio,"" Hottinger said. Referred to by some Republicans as the ""death tax,"" an estate tax of up to 7 percent is levied on the net value of an estate before its assets are transferred to anyone else. Ohio doesn't tax estates worth $338,333 or less, due to an available tax credit. Republicans said the tax puts Ohio at a disadvantage because 30 other states have no such tax. The plan introduced Tuesday calls for the tax to be repealed for deaths on or after Jan. 1 of this year. But eliminating the tax would be a blow to municipalities, which receive about 80 percent of estate tax revenue. That amounted to about $231 million in the last fiscal year. Rep. Mike Foley, a Democrat from Cleveland, criticized the GOP plan, saying the tax helps address the imbalance of wealth in this country by taxing the wealthy. He also lamented the loss of funds to local governments. ""Without it, local governments will be forced to cut services and further contemplate raising taxes on their own citizens to make up for the shortfall,"" Foley said. Other bills introduced Tuesday would:  Authorize Kasich, a Republican, to create JobsOhio, the private, nonprofit economic development corporation he will establish to replace the Ohio Department of Development.  Establish tax credits for employers who hire unemployed people and for businesses that expand into vacant buildings.  Prohibit late-term abortions. Rep. Lorraine Fende, a Democrat from Willowick, introduced the bill.  Take pit bulls off the state's ""vicious dog"" list.  Prohibit speeding tickets based on an officer's visual estimation of speed of a motor vehicle. House Speaker William G. Batchelder, a Medina Republican, said the legislation introduced Tuesday reflects the priorities of the entire GOP caucus, not merely those of the leaders. Batchelder said he intends to promote an inclusive atmosphere this General Assembly. Kasich also promoted cooperation Tuesday in a speech to lawmakers over lunch at the Statehouse. Kasich, who was sworn in Monday, focused on the upcoming state budget, which has a projected $8 billion shortfall. The loudest voices in the budget discussions will belong to Kasich and Republicans with majorities in the House and Senate. But the new governor urged Democrats to help find solutions and to join the fight against special interest groups. The special interest groups are ""going to come here and they're going to fight,"" Kasich said Tuesday. ""And if they win the fight . . . it's going to be more on people that have less."" Immediately after Kasich's speech promoting bipartisanship, the Senate fell back into the political bickering that marked the end of its session last year, when Republicans rejected nearly 80 of former Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland's appointees on Dec. 21. Senate Republicans voted Tuesday to reject an additional 14 appointments Strickland made in response to the Senate's rejections last month. The Senate rejected Strickland's appointments because Republicans felt Kasich should be able to fill those positions. ""What the Senate did today was tell Ohioans they need not apply for public service if they are appointed by a governor affiliated with the wrong political party,"" said Sen. Nina Turner, a Democrat from Cleveland.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2011/jan/21/jay-hottinger/rep-jay-hottingers-assessment-founding-father-unfo/,Politics,Polifact
22791,Florida Senate president: Cuts in education funding are likely,"Florida Senate president: Cuts in education funding are likely Haridopolos said policymakers would be passing a budget this spring without any new tax increases, which means they would have to make dramatic cuts to health care and education to make the math work. TALLAHASSEE  Florida Senate President Mike Haridopolos signaled Wednesday that the Legislature was unlikely to take up any big-ticket tax cuts this year given Florida's $3.62-billion projected budget shortfall, and that education could also face big cuts to patch the holes. ""I'm a big proponent of tax cuts. This is not a year I can push them through,"" the Brevard County lawmaker told reporters. And if Gov. Rick Scott wants to follow through on his campaign pledge of cutting taxes by $2 billion in his first year in office, Haridopolos said the governor would have to offset them with spending cuts. Scott has proposed to cut school property taxes by $1.4 billion and make up the millage reduction with more state dollars. He also promised to start phasing out Florida's corporate income tax, which could cost another $700 million this year. ""I think Rick Scott has a lot of ideas.  Any tax cut proposal would have to be met with equal spending cuts to make it viable,"" Haridopolos said. Although the governor has said the corporate tax cuts, in particular, could make it easier to lure new jobs to Florida, Haridopolos said he didn't think the state could afford it now. ""I don't see that happening at this point. It's something I'd like to do  but $3.5 billion short, and the problems with no tax increases, I don't see the math yet,"" Haridopolos said. Scott, in a brief session with reporters at the state's emergency operations center, indicated he's not ready to abandon his proposed tax cuts. ""The way to get the state back to work is to cut property taxes and phase out the corporate income tax, and we're going to get that done,"" Scott said. The Senate president said education could be particularly hard-hit in next year's budget, saying it may be impossible to make up for about $1.2 billion in expiring federal stimulus dollars that are financing core classroom programs. ""Whether you like to admit it or not, half our general revenue goes to education,"" Haridopolos told reporters. ""It's a very difficult spot to be in, and the reason we wanted to make the adjustments to the class-size amendment"" defeated by voters last fall. Sen. David Simmons, chairman of the Senate's school budget committee, acknowledged that it would be difficult to maintain education spending at current-year levels. The Maitland Republican had previously expressed more optimism that school funding would be spared significant cuts.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2011/jan/14/mike-haridopolos/florida-senate-president-warns-education-funding-c/,Politics,Polifact
22961,Transcript of Florida Gubernatorial Debate with CNNs John King,"KING: That was a minute and five seconds. Mr. Scott, take the same. SCOTT: All right. I dealt with the same sort of issue back in 1992 when Hurricane Andrew hit. I had a lot of hospitals down in Miami, and I was down there right after the hurricane hit. We had to completely evacuate one hospital, which was basically demolished. And I showed up, we had over 500 employees without homes. We had 154 patients in the hospital. I got nurses from the west coast of Florida over there within eight or nine hours, and I reopened two hospitals, and I stayed down there until it was solved. We did a fundraiser for all of our employees to make sure that they had the money to get back into their homes. Thats what you do. What they should  what Governor Crist and my opponent should have been doing down there, they should have stayed down there until the problem was solved. They should have been talking to all those local businesses. Ive been down there. And also explain that, you know, the beaches were basically open. I mean, we should  we should have been down there when they had all that possibility to be on national TV to say, look, the oil spill is not here. Part of the reason we hurt our tourism is the fact that, you know, we played the game, that oh, poor me. Theres problems down here. When the truth is, our beaches were pretty much spotless. (CROSSTALK) SMITH:  much of an environmentally plan. Essentially, watered-down growth management and you want to be receptive to drilling. What would you tell people, Florida has a long story of being environmentalist? SCOTT: Absolutely. You know, we all live  you know, we all live here because we love this environment. You know, we love the weather, we love the beaches, we love the Everglades, we love our lakes and rivers. And so, what we got to do is make sure we do everything we can, possibly can, to make sure we continue that. We restore the Everglades. We make sure we have the best water standards and things like that. At the same time, we got to make sure that, right now, our biggest issue is jobs. We need jobs. And so, what you have to balance is you have to balance the need that we got to keep a pristine environment, but we cant be raising taxes and we got  to build jobs, so I have a seven-step plan to get the state going back to work. KING: Im going to give you 30 seconds to respond his  what he just said about the environment, then we need to take a quick break. SINK: OK. Thank you. Well my opponent has said that he would do away with the Department of Community Affairs. Its the one state agency that holds local governments accountable for the dealings they have with developers. Thats why we have Amendment Four on the ballot because people were so frustrated about these out of control developments. I oppose Amendment Four because I think it would be a job killer. But we cannot do away with our Department of Community Affairs which is the only organization that handles growth management in Florida. He would just hand Florida over to development, to just go wild and thats not what Floridians want. (CROSSTALK) KING: I will give you a chance to respond. (CROSSTALK) KING: I will give you a chance to respond when we come back. (CROSSTALK) KING: Were going to take another quick break. The candidates for Florida governor are debating right here. Stay with us. (APPLAUSE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KING: Were back with the candidates for Florida governor, Republican Rick Scott, Democrat Alex Sink. We talked a bit earlier about the Arizona immigration law, and many states saying after this election they may try and copy it in their states. Another law Mr. Scott that a lot of conservatives want to copy is a new Nebraska abortion law. It essentially tries to redefine the abortion debate by saying the standard should not be viability, when the fetus can live outside the womb, but when the fetus can feel pain. The Nebraska abortion law sets that at 20 weeks. Would you support such a law and sign such a law into law here in the state of Florida? SCOTT: Lets go back to the last question on DCA. I have not said that I would eliminate DCA. What I would do is go back to the original purpose of DCA. My opponent is an Obama liberal. She thinks people in Tallahassee can tell local communities exactly what they ought to do. Lets look at whats happened across our state. You can go all across the state and developments have been killed by all the regulation, all the paperwork. In fact you have to go to three or four agencies. Ill give you an example. Down close where I live, Ave Maria University was recently built. Just in permits, just  not any building  just for the land, 78 permits, took years to do. DCA has killed jobs all across this state. We need to go back to the original purpose. SCOTT: With regard to abortion, I am pro-life. Im pro-life with the exceptions of rape, incest, and the life of the mother. KING: And would you sign a law that said the standard should be after 20 weeks, when the Nebraska law supporters say they have researched that fetus can feel the pain, would you sign that? Essentially under current law in most states it is 23 weeks or so most research shows when a fetus can live outside the womb. So it takes about three weeks to a month sliding back the line. Would you sign a law that said at 20 weeks, after 20 weeks no abortions? SCOTT: Yes. KING: Would you sign that law? SINK: No, I wouldnt because I support the laws that we have on the books right now in Florida. KING: And support them, thats it, a blanket support for abortion rights or when new medical and technology advances come into play, would you look at that? SINK: I follow the law, and I will uphold the law that we have in Florida currently, which does have restrictions, like parental notification. Thats what I support. But I have to go back and say something here about this debate tonight, because I know that our time is running short. And I dont think that the people of Florida have really heard yet what they need to hear from me and from my opponent. I have received the endorsement of 16 Florida newspapers. Every single newspaper that has endorsed has endorsed my candidacy, because they know that I have the character and the integrity and they also know that I have the business plan, that Im a fiscal conservative to carry our state forward in a matter that all Floridians can be proud of. My opponent, on the other hand, has refused to appear before a single editorial board, which is the first time in the history of this state SMITH: We have done a lot of talk about character and integrity. But we have  were going to have  our state is in serious financial trouble. Next year were going to have  we have had a Republican legislature for years. Next year it could have two very, very conservative leaders. There is not going to be sort of a moderating force, whether it was Charlie Crist or the Florida Senate. Have you seen anywhere that the Florida legislature has gone too far, too conservative in recent years, Ms. Sink? SINK: Oh Id be happy to respond to that. Just this year, they passed a slush fund bill to permit political slush funds and reintroduce slush funds into state government like Florida had many years ago. Governor Crist vetoed that bill, rightfully so. Maybe the best example is the Senate Bill Six that was passed. It was called a teacher pay bill, but actually if you look at the details and what the parents and the superintendents and the school board members actually knew that it was, it was a takeover by Tallahassee politicians and bureaucrats of local school making decisions. Those decisions ought to be made locally. That was rightfully vetoed. This Senate and House should have passed ethics reforms bills. We have had so much corruption all over the state and also look at the abuses in Tallahassee, credit cards, people losing  people leaving office.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/oct/26/alex-sink/sink-claims-scott-said-he-wants-do-away-state-dca/,Politics,Polifact
23068,Where's the Revolution?,"Features Where's the Revolution? Photo by iStockPhoto.com Note: Register for this months CLE, This Land Is Whose Land?, from 1-2 p.m. ET on Wednesday, April 15. Susette Kelo still misses the home she was forced to leave in 2007. It was a small, pink clapboard house (above) located in a working-class neighborhood of New London, Conn., at the edge of the Thames River just before it spills into Long Island Sound. The house wasnt luxurious, but Kelo was happy after moving there in 1997. It was a real neighborhood back then, she says. We watched out for each other. New London city officials, however, had other plans for the Fort Trumbull neighborhood where Kelo lived. After the federal government closed the Naval Undersea Warfare Center in 1996, taking some 1,500 jobs with it, the city was on a downward slide with rising unemployment and falling population. Those concerns gave rise to a plan to redevelop the Fort Trumbull area just south of the city center by replacing the single-family homes and small businesses there with high-end riverfront condominiums, restaurants, offices and a resort hotel. In January 2000, the New London City Council authorized the private, nonprofit New London Development Corp. to purchase 90 acres in the Fort Trumbull peninsula. The council also empowered the corporation to acquire land by eminent domain if any property owners refused to sell. Most owners did sell their properties to the corporation, but Kelo and a handful of others held outone of them had been born in her house in 1918 and lived there ever since. They battled in state and federal courts for five years, challenging the towns right to condemn their properties. The property owners took their fight all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. In the end, a sharply divided court ruled against them. By a 5-4 vote in Kelo v. City of New London, the justices ruled in 2005 that the citys actions did not violate the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment. The majority opinion emphasized that the court has consistently interpreted the public use requirement in the takings clause to broadly encompass public purposes such as redevelopment plans, even if they call for transferring ownership from one private party to another. Those who govern the city were not confronted with the need to remove blight in the Fort Trumbull area, but their determination that the area was sufficiently distressed to justify a program of economic rejuvenation is entitled to our deference, wrote Justice John Paul Stevens in his majority opinion. Because that plan unquestionably serves a public purpose, the takings challenged here satisfy the public-use requirement of the Fifth Amendment, Stevens concluded. The ruling set off a firestorm of indignation across the country. The notion that government may take one persons property and give it to someone else in the name of economic redevelopment struck many as drastically out of line with American principles of private ownership. Organizations and politicians across the ideological spectrum excoriated the Supreme Courts decision. In one national survey, 81 percent of the respondents disagreed with the decision. Kelo opened up the nations eyes to abuses that were going on all over the country: taking private property for purely economic purposes and transferring it to other private entities so they could essentially make a profit off somebody elses land, says Darius W. Dynkowski, a partner at Ackerman Ackerman & Dynkowski, a firm in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., that represents private property owners in eminent domain cases. He also chairs the Condemnation Committee in the ABA Section of Real Property, Trust and Estate Law. A legal upheaval followed the political upheaval. Or did it? ACTION APLENTY Without question, both legislatures and courts have been busy addressing the issue. In the nearly four years since the Supreme Courts ruling in Kelo, 43 states have enacted statutes or constitutional amendments restricting the use of eminent domain. Meanwhile, at least five state supreme courts have issued rulings that significantly impede government power to take private property. At the federal level, both Congress and the executive branch acted to limit Kelo-type takings. But there are dramatically conflicting views about whether these actions are going to change much about how governments at the local, state and federal levels use their eminent domain powers to advance redevelopment plans. Some experts say the reaction to Kelo has largely stopped the eminent domain bulldozer in its tracks. Its an enormous change, says Dana Berliner, a senior attorney in the Washington, D.C., office of the Institute for Justice, a libertarian public-interest law firm that represented Kelo and her neighbors in their Supreme Court case. Ive heard academics say that the changes arent that big, but from our position on the ground thats not true. Before any of this began, we were getting complaints about eminent domain abuse from around the entire country. Now the complaints are coming from pockets of states that dont have good legislation or supreme court rulings. Its been a major reduction. Berliner credits this shift to post-Kelo laws and rulings. Most states, either through legislation or judicial decision, have largely moved away from using eminent domain for private economic development, she says. But other experts arent sure just how much the sound and fury following Kelo really signifies. Most states have enacted some kind of legislation, but most of it doesnt do very much, says Steven J. Eagle, a professor at George Mason University School of Law in Arlington, Va., who chairs the Condemnation Law Committee in the ABA Section of State and Local Government Law. With very few exceptions, most of the statutes arent in states where this [economic taking] was done anyway. Susan K. Spurgeon, vice-chair of the ABA real estate sections Condemnation Committee, says, Kelo did not significantly change the law. The decision relied on years of federal precedents going back to Berman v. Parker, a takings case that the Supreme Court decided in 1954, says Spurgeon, a shareholder at Pennington, Moore, Wilkinson, Bell & Dunbar in Tampa, Fla. In Berman, the justices ruled 9-0 that Washington, D.C., officials acted within their powers when they condemned a department store in a blighted area that was slated for redevelopmenteven though the stores owner maintained that it was a viable, going concern. In his opinion, Justice William O. Douglas articulated an expansive view of eminent domain powers. The concept of the public welfare is broad and exclusive, Douglas wrote. The values it represents are spiritual as well as physical, aesthetic as well as monetary. And, he concluded, the goal of the redevelopment planto create a better balanced, more attractive communitymet the test for a valid public use. Moreover, wrote Douglas, we cannot say that public ownership is the sole method of promoting the public purposes of community redevelopment projects. The majority opinion in Kelo was consistent with the Supreme Courts expansive interpretations of public purpose in Berman and more recent cases. Without exception, our cases have defined that concept broadly, reflecting our long-standing policy of deference to legislative judgments in this field, wrote Justice Stevens for the court. A SETTLING FOUNDATION Nevertheless, some experts maintain that Kelo actually signaled a subtle shift in the Supreme Courts thinking about eminent domain powers. The first sign they point to is the slim 5-4 vote in Kelo compared to the 9-0 landslide in Berman. And they have interpreted even Stevens majority opinion as somewhat tepid in its affirmation of New Londons use of eminent domain powers. Justice Stevens, writing for the courts liberal wing, spoke only of stare decisis and federalism, Eagle says. Even then, he tempered the opinion with the observation that states could adopt stricter standards. Specifically, Stevens wrote that nothing in our opinion precludes any state from placing further restrictions on its exercise of the takings power. Further, he noted, as the submissions of the parties and their amici make clear, the necessity and wisdom of using eminent domain to promote economic development are certainly matters of legitimate public debate. Meanwhile, Justice Sandra Day OConnors dissenting opinionjoined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomasargued that the majority had taken the power of government to condemn private property for public use too far. Under the banner of economic development, all private property is now vulnerable to being taken and transferred to another private owner, so long as it might be upgradedi.e., given to an owner who will use it in a way that the legislature deems more beneficial to the publicin the process, OConnor wrote. The effect of that reasoning is to wash out any distinction between private and public use of propertyand thereby effectively to delete the words for public use from the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment. It became quickly evident that the public, elected officials and even some other courts did not want Kelo to be the final word on how government should wield its eminent domain powers. Legislators came under tremendous political pressure to rein in those powers. The legislature in Arkansas did not change its law on eminent domain after Kelo. Neither did lawmakers in Hawaii, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York or Oklahoma. But the remaining 43 states did. KERFUFFLE OVER FED FUNDS So did the federal government. in november 2005, Congress enacted the Bond Amendment as part of a larger bill. The amendment forbids recipients of federal transportation or housing grants to use that money to support the use of eminent domain powers to advance economic development that primarily benefits private entities. But the measure is largely cosmetic, says Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University, because it does not apply to mass transit or highway projects, or projects aimed at eliminating blight. As a result, hardly any projects receiving transportation or housing grants are actually subject to the prohibitions. And even in those cases, proving that a development project primarily benefits private entities is difficult. On June 23, 2006, President George W. Bush marked the first anniversary of the Kelo decision by signing, with much fanfare, an executive order that barred the federal government from engaging in Kelo-type takings. The order had some public relations effect for the administration, but there was little actual substantive impact, if only because federal agencies rarely invoke eminent domain powers in conjunction with economic development projects. Those actions ordinarily take place at the state and local government levels. And like the legislation passed by Congress, the exemptions contained in the order leave the federal government free to engage in any condemnations it might want to pursue, Somin says. Most of the restrictions on eminent domain powers that state legislatures passed during the post-Kelo furor also lack teeth, concludes Somin in an article scheduled for the June issue of the Minnesota Law Review. The primary reason why so many of these laws are ineffectiveSomin puts 23 of them in that categoryis that they still allow state and local governments to use eminent domain to condemn private property to facilitate development in blighted areas. In many states, the definition of blight is so open-ended that almost any parcel can be considered blighted, says Eagle, Somins colleague at George Mason. In his analysis, Somin determined that 20 states have adopted laws imposing some form of effective restrictions on Kelo-type takings. These laws generally narrow the definition of blight, thus preventing officials from easily evading the ban on takings for economic development. But even some of these measures fail to go as far as might have been expected given the political backlash against Kelo, suggests Somin. Legislation adopted in Minnesota and Pennsylvania, for instance, exempts local governments in the largest metropolitan areaswhere most eminent domain actions occurfrom applying strict new restrictions for the next several years. And some of the tough restrictions on economic development takings were adopted in states like Alabama, Georgia and South Dakota, where that kind of government action is rare. The most sweeping post-Kelo limits on eminent domain powers were adopted in New Mexico and Florida, a state with an extensive history of government takings to further economic development. Those laws get their bite, according to Somin, from the fact that they abolish both Kelo-type takings and condemnations to reduce blight. In doing so, Florida and New Mexico joined Utah, which already had those limits in place, as the only states so restrictive. Others come close. Nevada and both Dakotas have prohibited condemnations that would transfer ownership of property from one private party to another. Kansas borrowed from both approaches, adopting a near-ban on private-to-private takings while significantly narrowing its definition of blight. Dana Berliner Photo by Ron Aira THE BLIGHT STUFF Supreme courts in at least five states have joined the backlash against Kelo. In 2006, the high courts in Ohio (City of Norwood v. Horney) and Oklahoma (Muskogee County v. Lowery) explicitly rejected Kelos reasoning and held that economic development is not a public use under their state constitutions. New Jerseys Supreme Court was a bit more circumspect in Gallenthin Realty Development Inc. v. Borough of Paulsboro, a 2007 decision. Even before Kelo, New Jersey law did not authorize condemnation for economic development, but did allow it to remediate blight. In Gallenthin Realty, the high court narrowed the definition of blight, holding that it must involve an actual threat to public health or safety. The Missouri Supreme Court reached a similar result when it decided Centene Plaza Redevelopment Corp. v. Mint Properties in 2007. After Kelo, the Missouri legislature banned economic development takings while continuing to allow them to remediate blight. Under the law, portions of a city are blighted if they are economic and social liabilities. The court held that this standard was not met if an area was only an economic liability. Then the court defined social liability narrowly, as a current threat to the public health, safety and welfare. (The decision did not address another Missouri statute that allows local governments to condemn properties in areas designated as blighted on the basis of economic or social liability.) A 2007 ruling by Marylands highest court did not restrict a state law that permits condemnations for economic development or blight remediation, but it did limit the use of quick-take condemnationswhere property is turned over immediately with compensation determined later. In Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Valsamaki, the Maryland Court of Appeals ruled that a government entity must prove why it needs to take immediate possession of a property before it can impose a quick-take condemnation. Even with the flurry of actions by legislatures and courts, eminent domain powers may be restricted more by public opinion than by law. In that sense, Kelo seemed to wake a sleeping giant. While the Supreme Court was following long-standing precedent rather than carving out new government powers when it decided the case, Kelo caught the publics attentionand triggered its angerin a way that previous decisions on eminent domain did not. Even though the decision upheld government condemnation powers, the close vote of the justices seemed to reflect rising public fears that the cherished right of private property ownership was subject to growing incursions by government with little to show in return. Berman licensed massive urban renewal and blight condemnations that ended up displacing hundreds of thousands of people, says Somin. At the time, most jurists and others thought that this was acceptable. Since then, serious doubts have arisen about whether we forcibly displaced huge numbers of people for little or no gain. The publics hostility to Kelo led many government officials to reconsider how they use their powers. Municipalities are doing this less than they used to because opposition to eminent domain has become much more frequent and well-organized, says Berliner of the Institute for Justice. A lot of the proposals get hit with overwhelming public opposition, so cities find a way to do without eminent domain, which is what they should have been doing all along. COOLING-OFF PERIOD Public outrage doesnt last forever, however, and as it fades, government bodies may once again start to flex their condemnation muscles. Some local officials were intimidated by the public backlash to Kelo, but that wont last, says Timothy Sandefur, an attorney at the national litigation center of the Pacific Legal Foundation in Sacramento, Calif., which represents property owners in eminent domain cases. Efforts to accomplish that are continuing. Its not a legislative issue for every single state, like it was after Kelo, Berliner says, but most state legislatures are continuing to look at this. There also is likely to be more litigation on the issue, especially as state courts are asked to interpret laws adopted in response to Kelo. Moreover, suggests Somin, maybe the Supreme Court will eventually revisit Kelo, since it was a closely contested, 5-4 case. It is possible, however, that the movement against eminent domain has peaked. In Utaha state that had adopted strict limits on condemnations of private property before Kelothe legislature had second thoughts and in 2007 passed a law that once again allows municipalities to condemn properties under plans to restore blighted neighborhoods. In November, California voters approved Proposition 99, which prohibits government entities in the state from taking a single-family residence and then transferring it to another private owner. But voters rejected a sweeping ban on all economic development takings that was put forward by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayer Association. The main proponent of Proposition 99 was the League of California Cities. We felt that if we didnt address this issue, someone else would put forward a proposition that would go far beyond limiting Kelo-like takings, says Patrick Whitnell, the leagues general counsel. Susette Kelo now lives in a house in Groton, Conn., directly across the river from where her beloved pink cottage used to be. That house is long gone, moved by her supporters to a spot near downtown New London. As for the citys ambitious development, it hasnt materialized. The private developer couldnt put together financing, so the project is in limbo and the land is vacant. For Kelo, its not a pretty sight. Im never going to forget about it, she says. It stares me in the face every day.

23530,Rick Perry: The TT Interview,"I arrived at Rick Perry's Capitol suite, accompanied by another Texas Tribune reporter and one of our photographers, around lunchtime on Thursday, April 15. We were there to capture, on tape and on film, an exclusive interview with the governor conducted as the first-ever collaboration between the Tribune and Newsweek magazine. A Newsweek photographer was also on hand, having earlier shot Perry for the cover of this week's issue, which features several pieces about Texas. Inside his office, the governor greeted us cheerfully and plopped down on a leather sofa, eager to talk about a full range of topics: the Tea Party, health care reform, Mexico, the state budget and, of course, his plans for 2012. The Q&A that follows is condensed and edited, though it includes several exchanges that do not appear in the version Newsweek published today. The full, unedited audio of the interview can be found in the right-hand column of this page, along with snippets broken out by subject. --------------- The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. Exactly one year ago today you were on the steps of Austin City Hall, talking about the possibility of secession. I was asked, What do you think about the people who shout out the word secede? And I said that we live in an incredibly wonderful country, and I see absolutely no reason for that to ever happen. But I do understand peoples concern and anger about what this administration is doing from an economic standpoint  in particular, the long-term debt thats being created for not only them but for future generations. A year later, youre more resolute about the divide between the states and the federal government. Absolutely. I think more people in the last year have picked up a copy of the Constitution and read what the Tenth Amendment says in its simplicity: that the federal government was created to be an agent for the states, not the other way around. I think that is a very, very good thing. The future of America is inextricably intertwined with the states pushing back on Washington, D.C. Our Founding Fathers had a vision of this collection of states working together but competing against each other  putting different concepts into play, seeing which ones work, which ones dont, allowing governors and legislatures to look around and say, You know what? Thats a good idea over there. The federal government wants to be the epicenter of all thought and policy and one-size-fits-all. Its very clear that we have very, very different ideas about the structure of this country and how it should work. The Tea Parties are a reflection of that. I think they are highly economic-driven. At the end of the day, it is about the economy  thats really what drives people. Government is basically saying, I dont care how hard you work. We are going to take more of [your money], because we know best how to redistribute it around the country. It really irritates a lot of Americans. You talked very early about invoking the 10th Amendment to rebut health care reform, and now you and the attorney general have joined with other states to sue the federal government. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. I think Texans do not want a government 1,500 miles removed from the state micromanaging health care. As you know, our state has the highest percentage of its citizens without insurance: senior citizens, children, working families. If you dont like reform coming out of Washington, what do you do to solve that problem? For over two years, weve had a waiver request in front of the Health and Human Services Committee  before this administration got in place, I might add  that would allow us some flexibility to use federal dollars differently than whats mandated by the federal government to create insurance opportunities for those who are uninsured today. Thats one example. I think there are a number of ways that, if the states were left to their own devices, you would see substantially more Texans who had access to health care. What we would like to see are ways to create a more efficient distribution and preventative healthcare. Lets switch gears to Mexico. Foreign policy is not often a concern of the governor of Texas  Actually, foreign policy is a concern of the governor of Texas, or it should be, every day. The reason is a 1,200-mile border with a foreign country. And the number one exporting state in America has to have substantial interest and knowledge of foreign markets. You believe that we need to do more on border security. Let me speak to the 800-pound gorilla sitting in the room, and that is the failure of Washington to do one of its primary duties: secure our border. Thats the reason I went to the Legislature in '07  prior to this administration. This was during the Bush administration, with [Michael] Chertoff as the secretary [of homeland security]. We were making pleas. We were requesting support. I talked about bringing predator drones to the border as early as '05. Those training missions were going to be flown somewhere. Why not up and down the border of the United States with Mexico? So what are we not doing in Texas that we should be doing? The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. The fact is, we shouldnt have to be doing anything. The federal governments responsibility has always been to operate the security mechanism along the border. When they proved to us that they did not have the interest or the desire, thats when we acted. Thats when we put Operation Linebacker and multiple surge operations in place. Those have been successful up to a point, but we dont have the resources or the manpower to secure the border the way it needs to be. A 1,000-troop National Guard request has been in front of this president for over a year, and no response. We are forced by Washingtons inaction to take action ourselves. You govern a state at the epicenter of the demographic change coming to this country. Theres a debate going on right now about whether, after [the protracted fight over] health care reform, Congress should take up immigration. Would you like to see some kind of reform come together? Immigration reform cant happen until you secure the border. This isnt a chicken-or-egg issue. You can have all the discussions and the debates you want, but they are all going to be failures unless and until you secure the border. We are about to enter a legislative session with a biennial budget shortfall of anywhere from $10 billion to $20 billion, depending upon on who you talk to. Last session, the federal stimulus was used to help balance our books  and to help pay down our debt from two sessions ago. By the way, if you hate the feds so much, why did you take $17 billion in stimulus money? Texas is a major donor state. We Texans send billions of dollars to Washington, D.C., in the form of federal gas taxes and income taxes. These are Texas-earned, Texas-generated dollars  monumental amounts of money, substantially more than flows back into this state. So the idea that were going to be purer than pure and not take any money back because its been identified as stimulus dollars? These are our dollars. This is our money. This session there will be no stimulus money available, so you and the lieutenant governor and the speaker have asked state agencies to cut 5 percent of their budgets. Your Democratic opponent, Bill White, refers to this as Soviet-style budgeting  he thinks having a mandate for every state agency to cut the same thing is not the best way to go. My suggestion is that he doesnt know much about the way we operate here in Austin. Its called prioritization, and weve done it before. In 2003, we had a $10 billion budget shortfall. We came into office and we addressed it, I will suggest to you, the same way we will address it 2011: We will make reductions, but we will prioritize where those cuts occur. There are a thousand people a day moving to the state of Texas. If this was a vestige of the Soviet Union, as Mr. White made reference to, Im not thinking thats what people would be beating down our doors to come to. They are coming to Texas because they know this is the only place, or one of the only places left in this country, where freedom and liberty still reign, where you can keep more of what you worked for. The idea that somehow or another Texas has gone to hell in a handbasket  if thats his campaign slogan, it will not be successful. What about the Rainy Day Fund? Theres between $8 billion and $9 billion in there. I really think its a little premature for me to be saying today, I want to use part of the Rainy Day Fund. Go back to 2003. We were able to cut a higher percentage of the budget in 2003 than wed need to in 2011. So Im going to say, Oh, gosh, we cant make that many reductions in spending. Were going to have to go into the Rainy Day Fund? Or, worse yet, Were going to have to raise taxes? I dont think you have to do that. Earlier this year I asked Mayor White if he would commit not to raising taxes? Will you commit? I dont see any reason you have to [raise taxes]. And whats happened to the city of Houston versus my record in 2003  I like my track record better. Mayor White says he reduced taxes six times as mayor. We will have a most interesting discussion of the city of Houstons financial affairs over the next six months. I want to ask you about redistricting. A range of Republicans, from [former U.S. Secretary of State] James Baker to [Land Commissioner] Jerry Patterson to [San Antonio state Sen.] Jeff Wentworth, have told me recently that the process of redrawing the maps should be depoliticized  should be taken out of the hands of politicians. Given the controversy over redistricting the last time and the desire of many people at the Capitol to avoid it this time, what should we do on that issue? Anyone who says Lets take politics out of redistricting is either naive or has another agenda that I have a hard time identifying. Youll have to ask those three whether they are nave or they have another agenda. I dont know what theyre thinking. I think the process will work. It has worked for a number of years. It has never been pleasant. And it can work without going into a special session. People need to stick around and do their jobs. Youve been in public office for more than 25 years, and you are the longest-serving governor in the history of the state. Yet youve managed to run for the last few months as an outsider. I disagree that I paint myself as somehow outside. Now, I did run a [primary] campaign as us  Texas  versus Washington. We were running against an individual who was in Washington, D.C., for 17 years. Washington is the center of bad public policy in most peoples opinion and has been for some time  not just in this current administration, though this administration is carrying it to new levels. Do you want Texas to be run the way it has been run, with a Texas-centric philosophy, or do you want this person from Washington, D.C., to come down here and use Washington-style policies and philosophies? I think the people sent a pretty strong message. A couple different times in this conversation, youve alluded to having to battle problems that predated the Obama administration. I cant help but notice that you have a bust of Ronald Reagan, who you consider to be a great president, over your shoulder. I dont see a bust anywhere of George W. Bush. Um, I dont know whether George has gotten any busts done yet. Do you consider Mr. Bush to have been a great president? At the end of the day, when the history books are written, I think George W. Bush will go down as a very, very good president. Approaching great? I dont know yet  I mean, a year and a half after hes been out of office may be a little too early to write Georges history. But here is why he was an incredibly good president: because the man kept America safe. As the president of the United States, he made one of the most difficult decisions that a sitting president ever makes: to go to war. There are two things that people judge presidents on: their safety and the economy. When you were campaigning for Rudy Giuliani in Iowa during the '08 presidential campaign, you said, George W. Bush was never a fiscal conservative. Never was. Right. Do you still believe that? I dont think he was fiscally conservative in the sense that it was his main focus day in and day out. Cutting spending and looking for ways to make government more efficient was not something that George particularly focused on. Not as governor and not as president. When you said earlier in the week at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference that America has been flying in the fog for too long, you were likewise talking about a time before Obama administration. Oh, yeah, since the '30s. If Americans want to really go back and historically engage when we really got off track, it started in 1930, with Franklin Roosevelt and the start of the Great Depression and the maneuvering of Roosevelt and Congress as they started to pull power into Washington, D.C., and create government programs and government agencies. Youre opposed to the New Deal? Yes. I think the programs created by the New Deal and the monetary jury-rigging that went on in our society exacerbated the Great Depression and pushed us farther down. The New Deal did not get America out of the Great Depression; World War II did. Generally speaking, the expansion of government at the federal level has not, by and large, been good for the American people. Everybody wants to know about your plans for 2012. In your speech at the SRLC last week, you sounded like a presidential candidate. Are you considering running and would you consider it? No and no. You are not considering running for president. You will not run for president. Thats correct. Under any circumstances? Thats correct. There is no way. No, sir. Vice president? Would you be willing to consider that? No. I dont care about going to Washington, D.C. Your party could not come to you and say, Governor, all the other alternatives are wanting. Youre our guy. There will be an alternative that is not wanting. I have a great interest in who this individual is going to be, but I want to be a governor who is leading a state. The reason I go to things like the Southern Republican Leadership Conference, the reason I am engaged in the Republican Governors Association, the reason I agree to do interviews with national publications is so that people will pay attention to what is going on in Texas. Our policies, and the results of those policies, are worth having a national dialogue about. I want people elected to Congress, to the United States Senate and to the presidency in 2012 with the express message that we are going to go to Washington and try to make Washington as inconsequential in your life as we can make it. I want the states to become the laboratories of innovation and experimentation. And I want to get this country back.

23587,This Week' Transcript: Secretaries Gates and Clinton,"TAPPER: Good morning, everyone. We start this morning with the announcement that Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens is retiring. The longest sitting justice on the court, Stevens is firmly in the liberal block, and now the president has his second Supreme Court appointment. And coming in this polarized atmosphere and an election year, the nation's capital will likely have a long, hot summer. Joining me this morning, two senators who will play key roles in the confirmation battle, Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican Jon Kyl, both members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senators, thanks so much for joining me. SCHUMER: Morning. KYL: Thank you, Jake. TAPPER: Senator Kyl, we just heard you say that you are concerned about President Obama nominating what you call an overly ideological person. We know four people on the short list include Solicitor General Elena Kagan, Judge Merrick Garland, Judge Diane Wood, and Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano. Are any of them overly ideological? KYL: It will depend upon the analysis of what they have written, what they have said, judicial decisions they've made, and what they say in hearings is when my colleagues and I, I think, would reach that conclusion. They are all nominally qualified, and again, the question I think to present is, do judges like this or candidates like this approach judging on the basis of each case presenting its unique facts and law and being decided strictly on that basis, rather than with a judge coming to the bench with an ideological position. For example, I've heard colleagues say, we want somebody who will be tough on executive powers. I've heard somebody else say, we need somebody to be tough on large corporations. No, you need somebody that will decide the case. Whether the big corporation or the executive should win a particular case depends upon the facts of the case and the law, not on the judge's ideology before that person even gets to the bench. TAPPER: Well, let me just follow up with you for a second, Senator Kyl, because Senator Jeff Sessions, the ranking Republican on Judiciary, and other colleagues of yours, have talked about the importance of this nomination because the Supreme Court will likely hear from the states who are trying to block the federal government from requirement individual citizens to get health insurance. What will you be asking the nominee when it comes to that issue? KYL: Well, first of all, you don't ask the nominee how he or she would rule on a case that's likely to come to the court. But you try to discern their attitudes. I was just in a small town in Arizona. As I drove into town, I saw a sign for the reelection of a judge, reelect Judge so-and-so. He's fair. That's all you ask for, in addition to the qualifications, which I'm sure the candidate will have. What I object to and I think my colleagues would object to is somebody that comes in with preconceived notions about how particular cases should be decided. For example, on the case of the required -- requirement that you buy insurance under the health care bill. Just decide that case based upon the reading of the law, what the precedents are and what the specific wording of the statute is. Nothing more. TAPPER: Senator Schumer, you said in 2007 that the Senate should reverse the presumption of confirmation, and that a nominee's ideology does matter. Should Republicans adopt the Schumer principle when considering President Obama's nominee? SCHUMER: Well, I think actually, in fact, Senator Kyl and I in terms of standard are saying the same thing. What you want is somebody who will follow the law, not make the law. Not impose their ideology, if they're far right, far left, on the law itself. If they're in the mainstream, you don't have to agree with all of their views to vote for them. I voted for hundreds of judges that George Bush nominated, and I didn't agree with their views, their judicial ideology. But as long as I thought they would follow the law, not make law, I was willing to vote for them. And the one final thing I'd say is this. If you look at who President Obama has nominated, somebody like Judge Sotomayor, who got nine Republicans to vote for her, no one questioned that she was out of the mainstream. The other nominees in many of the courts of appeals and district courts, he chooses people in the mainstream. So I don't think there's going to be a filibuster or a blocking. And furthermore, practically, this is not a switched vote -- a swing vote in the sense that your -- having somebody, Justice Stevens, and President Obama is likely to choose somebody in Justice Stevens' image. TAPPER: Senator Schumer, do you think that if you were giving President Obama advice, would you recommend that he go with a more moderate person ideologically, or does it matter? SCHUMER: Well, the first and most important criterion is legal excellence, and of course I think we'll find that. To me, there is a second criteria that matters a lot, and it's a little bit different. In my view at least, Justice Roberts has tried to move the court very far to the right, much further than we ever envisioned. I think Justice Stevens felt that in some of the opinions, dissents that he rendered. And he's been able to get Justice Kennedy to go along with some of those. So my view would be, I'd like the new nominee to be one of five, not one of four when the votes come up, and somebody who would be quite persuasive in terms of influencing other justices, I guess particularly Justice Kennedy, to his or her point of view. And that would matter to me more than -- more than any particular ideology. TAPPER: Senator Kyl, almost the reverse question for you when it comes to the filibuster. Throughout the Bush years, you repeatedly spoke against Democrats using the filibuster. In 2008, you said this, quote, ""It's been understood by both parties that you do not play politics when it comes to confirming judges, because while you may be able to stop the other party president's nominations one time, they might be able to stop yours next time. Besides which, it's not good government, it's not doing the people's business. The president was elected fair and square. He has the right to submit judicial nominees, and it's the Senate's obligation under the Constitution to act on those nominees. So are you willing to take the filibuster off the table? KYL: I am going to abide by what became known as the rule of the gang of 14. After President Bush was elected in 2000, Democrats successfully filibustered or threatened to filibuster 12 judges on the circuit court of appeals that were nominated by President Bush, including Miguel Estrada, an extraordinarily fine individual. And that was beginning to get out of hand, and eventually 14 senators got together and said, look, we will not filibuster any judge except in extraordinary circumstances. And that's pretty much the way that it's been ever since then. And that's why I think both Chuck and I would agree that it is unlikely that there would be a filibuster, except if there is an extraordinary circumstance. I'm never going to take it off the table because of what the Democrats have achieved here, which is the possibility of a filibuster. President Obama himself attempted to filibuster Justice Alito, who now sits on the Supreme Court. So if the president isn't going to take it off the table, I'm not going to take it off the table. But I think it can easily be avoided by appointing, frankly, the kind of person that Senator Schumer just mentioned, someone who is mainstream enough that with intellect and the application of good law can persuade colleagues to support his position or her position. SCHUMER: And the only good news, I'd say, Jake, is I think that it's just about a certainty that the president will nominate someone in the mainstream, so the likelihood of a filibuster is tiny. TAPPER: We only have a couple of minutes left, so I am going to exercise my prerogative against filibusters with you two, if you would, just bear with me and be very quick. I want to ask about a couple of international issues. Senator Schumer, the Israeli newspaper ""Yedioth Ahronot"" quoted an anonymous confidante to President -- I'm sorry, to Prime Minister Netanyahu, calling President Obama quote, ""the greatest disaster for Israel, a strategic disaster."" I'm sure you have some constituents who share those views, and perhaps those concerns. Do you think that the White House has behaved towards Israel and the prime minister of Israel as you would want them to? SCHUMER: Well, let me say this. I think everybody here in the United States, virtually everybody, and the vast majority of Israelis want peace. They're willing to accept a two-state solution. The best way to bring about that peace is let the two sides negotiate, and bring them together. I think one of the problems we have faced in the Middle East is that too many of the Palestinians, they elected Hamas, sworn to Israel's destruction, don't really believe in peace. And I do believe that you have to let the two parties come together. If the United States imposes preconditions, particularly on the Palestinian and Arab side, they'll say, we won't come and negotiate. TAPPER: Very quickly, Senator Kyl. You helped lead the cause of immigration reform in 2007. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said that he is going to bring up immigration reform. You said the other day in Yuma, Arizona, that Republicans will use the opportunity to filibuster. Are you going to help with the filibuster of immigration reform? KYL: I don't think I said that, Jake, but what I did say is that the conditions for immigration reform no longer exist. The consensus that existed before does not exist. And among other reasons, because the administration -- this current administration has not done what's necessary to secure the border and enforce the law. We just saw the tragic death of a rancher down on the border, presumably from drug smugglers or illegal immigrants, that simply illustrates once again the fact that we have not controlled the border. And until that's done, I think it's going to be very difficult for Congress to support legislation that would be as comprehensive as that I supported three years ago. TAPPER: OK, Senator Kyl and Schumer, thank you so much for joining us. We really appreciate it. Enjoy the rest of your weekend. Even before news from the Supreme Court, this has been a momentous week for the president. He signed a new nuclear arms treaty with the Russians and released a new nuclear policy. Two of the main architects of the president's nuclear policy are Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. I spoke with them Friday at the Pentagon. TAPPER: Secretary Clinton, I'd like to start with you. This has been a big week for talking about deterrents. Especially deterrents against Iran. And yet we learned that Iran is announcing the third generation of centrifuges. Six times faster than the previous generation. Is Iran not saying to the United States, ""We are not deterred""? CLINTON: Well, Jake, it has been a very positive week for American foreign policy, and particularly with respect to our nuclear posture. When it comes to Iran, we take everything they say with more than a grain of salt, because we know that they have a -- a tendency to say things that may or may not be carried out. May or may not be accurate. But in fact their belligerence is helping to make our case every single day. Countries that might have had doubts about Iranian intentions, who might have even questioned whether Iran was seeking nuclear weapons, are having those doubts dispelled as much by the evidence we present as by what comes out of the leadership of Iran. TAPPER: Secretary Gates, just a year and a half ago you had a different boss but you had the same job. And you were expressing support for the idea that nuclear weapons can be an effective deterrent against chemical and biological weapons. GATES (from October 28, 2008): ""In the first Gulf War, we made it very clear that if Saddam used chemical or biological weapons, then the United States would keep all options on the table. We later learned that this veiled threat had the intended deterrent effect as Iraq considered its options."" TAPPER: It's a refrain that a lot of Republicans have talked about that the United States is taking things off the table that would deter other countries. Did you change your mind? GATES: Well I think what's happened is the situation has changed. We have more robust deterrents today, because we've added to the nuclear deterrent missile defense. And -- and with the phased adaptive approach that the president has approved, we will have significantly greater capability to deter the Iranians, because we will have a significantly greater missile defense. We're also developing this conventional prompt global strike, which really hadn't gone anywhere in the -- in the Bush administration, but has been embraced by the new administration. That allows us to use long range missiles with conventional warheads. So we have -- we have more tools if you will in the deterrents kit bag than -- than we used to. TAPPER: Secretary Clinton, the United States according to the nuclear posture review -- the United States will not be developing new nuclear weapons. China will. Russia will. You said, when you were running for president in 2007 CLINTON (from August 2, 2007): ""Presidents should be very careful at all times in discussing the use or non-use of nuclear weapons. Presidents since the cold war have used nuclear deterrents to keep the peace. I don't believe that any president should make any blanket statements with respect to the use or non-use of nuclear weapons."" TAPPER: Did you change your mind? CLINTON: No, Jake. Because I think if you actually read the nuclear posture review, you would make three conclusions. First -- we intend to maintain a robust nuclear deterrent. Let no one be mistaken. The United States will defend ourselves, and defend our partners and allies. We intend to sustain that nuclear deterrent by modernizing the existing stockpile. In fact, we have $5 billion in this year's budget going into that very purpose. We believe, and this is a collective judgment from this government that is certainly shared by the secretary of defense, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the secretary of energy, and the others along with the State Department who worked on this nuclear posture review, that we can have the kind of deterrent that we need by modernizing our stockpile, but not necessarily having to replace and build new nuclear weapons. But if there is a conclusion down the road that there does have to be consideration for some kind of replacement, that decision will go to the president. We don't think that we'll get there. We think that we have more than an adequate nuclear deterrent. And with this emphasis on our nuclear stockpile, and the stewardship program that we are engaged in, that we'll be, you know, stronger than anybody in the world as we always have been with more nuclear weapons than are needed many times over. And so we do not see this as in any way a diminishment of what we are able to do. GATES: Let me -- let me just chime in, in this respect. The reliable replacement warhead program that existed in the past was really a means to an end. It was a means to modernizing the nuclear stockpile as Secretary Clinton says. Making it more reliable, safer, and -- and more secure. It -- that -- the policy of the Bush administration was also not to -- to -- not to add new nuclear capabilities. This was about how do you make the stockpile safer and more reliable. The approach that we now have is -- is intended to do exactly that. It offers us a path forward, as Secretary Clinton says, in terms of reuse, refurbishment, and -- and if necessary, replacement of components. Not an entire warhead necessarily. So the chiefs, and I and -- and the directors of the nuclear labs are all very comfortable that -- that this puts us in a position to modernize the stockpile and -- and the $5 billion dollars that Hillary has referred to is actually just what's in our budget to -- for this program. There is another big chunk of money in the Department of Energy budget for this infrastructure and modernization program as well. So we think this is a pretty robust approach to -- to sustaining and modernizing the stockpile. TAPPER: Let's turn to the nuclear security summit that's about to start. Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel has said he's -- he's not going to come amidst concerns that some of the Arab and Muslim countries -- Egypt and Turkey in particular -- were going to raise the worst kept secret in the world that Israel has nuclear weapons and the fact that Israel is not a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty. Don't they have a point? CLINTON: Well part of the goal of the nuclear security summit is to focus on the threat from nuclear terrorism. And we don't believe the threat from nuclear terrorism comes from states. Our biggest concern is that terrorists will get nuclear material. We fear North Korea and Iran, because their behavior as -- the first case, North Korea being -- already having nuclear weapons, and Iran seeking them -- is that they are unpredictable. They have an attitude toward countries like Israel, like their other neighbors in the Gulf that makes them a danger. So we are focusing on the two states, but we are also very concerned about nuclear material falling into terrorists' hands. And that's a concern that we all share. So part of the challenge is to bring the world together as President Obama is doing in the nuclear security summit. To have everyone sign off on an agreed upon work plan that will enable us to begin to try to tie up these loose nukes, and these loose nuclear materials. To make sure they don't fall into the wrong hands. And Israel will be represented by the deputy prime minister. And will be at the table as we begin to try to figure out how to deal with this particular problem. TAPPER: Is that a good thing, because it would have made the summit into a -- a side show? CLINTON: Well that's a decision for every government to make as to who comes and who doesn't come. So the point is that countries will be represented. And the overall goal of this nuclear security summit is to make progress. I have to say, Jake, you know this is something that Secretary Gates and I have said repeatedly. You know, the threat of nuclear war -- nuclear attack as we grew up with in the Cold War has diminished. The threat of nuclear terrorism has increased. And we want to get the world's attention focused where we think it needs to be with these continuing efforts by Al Qaeda and others to get just enough nuclear material to cause terrible havoc, destruction, and loss of life somewhere in the world. TAPPER: President Obama officials say he's contemplating presenting a peace plan to help jump start the process between the Israelis and the Palestinians. What advice do you give President Obama when it comes to whether or not he should offer a peace plan? CLINTON: Well I never share advice that I give directly to any president. TAPPER: Well then, hypothetically? CLINTON: Well -- and I don't answer hypotheticals. But I will say this. That this administration from the very first day has made it clear we are committed to pursuing a path of peace in the Middle East. And to get the two parties to get to a point where they can engage in negotiations again to deal with these very difficult final status issues. Our goal remains the resumption -- the relaunch of negotiations. Both indirect -- eventually leading to direct, and that's our focus. TAPPER: Secretary Gates, turning to Afghanistan, when you hear President Karzai refer to the 87,000 troops under your command when you -- as occupiers, and suggest that he could envision joining the Taliban, how does that affect you? Does it make your blood boil? GATES: Well I think, you know, this is a -- a man who's first of all a political leader. He has domestic audiences as well as foreign audiences. What I can tell you is that General McChrystal continues to meet with him regularly. They have a very positive relationship. He gets very good cooperation out of President Karzai. I think that the -- the Afghans are very concerned about their sovereignty. And they are very concerned that -- that it be clear who -- who is the president of Afghanistan. And -- and that he be treated with respect, because he is the representative of the people of Afghanistan and their sovereignty. And I think that -- I think that that kind of cooperative relationship, certainly that he has with -- I can only speak for General McChrystal's side of it. But I think General McChrystal feels that this is a man he can work easily with. And -- and he has taken him to Kandahar. He has indicated he's willing to go to Kandahar repeatedly for the Shuras as the Kandahar campaign gets underway. So I think that the -- that the day to day working relationship, certainly on the military side, and -- and between General McChrystal and President Karzai is -- is working well. And I think -- I think we frankly have to be sensitive in our own comments about President Karzai in terms of being mindful that he is the embodiment of sovereignty for Afghanistan also in the way we treat him. TAPPER: Secretary Gates, WikiLeaks recently released a video that showed U.S. troops killing some civilians in Iraq. I understand the fog of war, and I understand that -- that this was a very difficult situation. Does the release of that video, and the fact that that happened damage the image of the U.S. in the world? GATES: I don't think so. They're -- they're in a combat situation. The video doesn't show the broader picture of the -- of the firing that was going on at American troops. It's obviously a hard thing to see. It's painful to see, especially when you learn after the fact what was going on. But you -- you talked about the fog of war. These people were operating in split second situations. And, you know, we -- we've investigated it very thoroughly. And it's -- it's unfortunate. It's clearly not helpful. But by the same token, I think -- think it should not have any lasting consequences. TAPPER: Secretary Clinton. I -- I do want to ask you a couple of domestic questions. First of all, there was a Supreme Court opening. What advice would you give President Obama? CLINTON: Well I think President Obama is fully aware of this great responsibility and opportunity that Justice Stevens' retirement presents him. And as a former law professor, I know he is devoted to the Constitution. And understands the critical role that the court plays in so many areas of our -- our lives as Americans. And I'm confident that he's going nominate a highly qualified person. And I hope that there will be a smooth confirmation, because whoever the president nominates will be qualified to sit on the court. And I think it would be really reassuring for the country to see Republicans and Democrats working together to confirm a nominee as soon as possible. TAPPER: And lastly, healthcare reform. When you look at President Obama's success that he was able to get this done. Do you think, ""Oh, that's how you do it?"" Or do you think that the only way he was able to do it was because you and your husband stormed the castle first. And even if it didn't work, you laid the ground work for President Obama to help to be able to succeed? CLINTON: Jake, I don't think either of those things. I think thank goodness. Finally the United States is going to have a system that will begin to meet the needs of all of our people, reform our insurance industry which is long overdue. Begin to control costs, which is absolutely critical. And, you know, it's been a long time coming. It goes back many decades. And I think it's an extraordinary historical achievement. And I'm delighted to, you know, have -- have seen it come to pass. TAPPER: Secretary Clinton, Secretary Gates, thanks so much for joining us. GATES: Pleasure.

24171,So Much For Wise Latinas,"Ann Coulter Letter With the Supreme Courts decision in Ricci v. DeStefano this week, we can now report that Sonia Sotomayor is even crazier than Ruth Bader Ginsburg. To recap the famous Ricci case, in 2003, the city of New Haven threw out the results of a firefighters test  which had been expressly designed to be race-neutral  because only whites and Hispanics scored high enough to receive immediate promotions, whereas blacks who took the test did well enough only to be eligible for promotions down the line. Inasmuch as the high-scoring white and Hispanic firemen were denied promotions solely because of their race, they sued the city for race discrimination. Obamas Justice-designate Sotomayor threw out their lawsuit in a sneaky, unsigned opinion  the judicial equivalent of ""talk to the hand."" She upheld the citys race discrimination against white and Hispanic firemen on the grounds that the test had a ""disparate impact"" on blacks, meaning that it failed to promote some magical percentage of blacks. This strict quota regime was dressed up by the city  and by Sotomayors opinion  as a reasonable reaction to the threat of lawsuits by blacks who were not promoted. Thats a complicated way of saying: Racial quotas are peachy. According to Sotomayor, any test that gets the numbers wrong  whatever ""wrong"" means in any given context of professions, populations, applicants, workers, etc.  is grounds for a lawsuit, which in turn, is grounds for an employer to engage in race discrimination against disfavored racial groups, such as white men. Consequently, the only legal avenue available to employers under Sotomayors ruling is always to impose strict racial quotas in making hiring and promotion decisions. Say, if the threat of a lawsuit permits the government to ignore the Constitution, can pro-lifers get New Haven to shut down all abortion clinics by threatening to sue them? Theres no question but that abortion clinics have a ""disparate impact"" on black babies. This week, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 for the white and Hispanic firefighters, overturning Sotomayors endorsement of racial quotas. But all nine justices rejected Sotomayors holding that different test results alone give the government a green light to engage in race discrimination. Even Justice Ginsburgs opinion for the dissent clearly stated that ""an employer could not cast aside a selection method based on a statistical disparity alone."" Indeed, the dissenters argued that the case should be returned to the lower courts to look for some hidden racial bias in the test. For Sotomayor, the results alone proved racial bias. The one advantage Sotomayors talk-to-the-hand opinion has over Justice Ginsburgs prolix dissent is that brevity prevented Sotomayor from having to explain why quotas arent quotas. That was left to Ginsburg. Liberals desperately want race quotas  as long as quotas never come to their offices. But they cant say that, so instead they talk in circles for 10 hours straight, until everyone else is exhausted, and then, when no one is paying attention, they announce: So were all agreed  we will have racial quotas. Based on her lifetime of experience working as a firefighter, Ginsburg said: ""Relying heavily on written tests to select fire officers is a questionable practice, to say the least."" Liberals prefer a more objective test, such as race. Isnt excelling on written tests how Ruth Bader Ginsburg got where she is? Its curious how people whose entire careers are based on doing well on tests find them so irrelevant to other peoples jobs. In the middle of a fire, it can either be a great idea or the worst possible idea to open a door. An excellent method for finding out if your next fire chief knows the correct answer is a written test. Unleashing the canard of all race-obsessed liberals, Ginsburg observed that courts have found that a fire officers job ""involves complex behaviors, good interpersonal skills, the ability to make decisions under tremendous pressure, and a host of other abilities  none of which is easily measured by a written, multiple choice test."" So does a lawyers job. And yet attorneys with absolutely no ""interpersonal skills"" get cushy jobs and extravagant salaries on the basis of their commendable performance on all manner of written tests, from multiple choice LSATs and bar exams to written law school exams. I note that Ginsburg has not shown any particular interest in rectifying the ""disparate impact"" of legal exams: She never hired a single black law clerk out of the dozens she employed in more than a decade as an appeals court judge. (Her hiring practices on the Supreme Court are a state secret, but I can state with supreme certainty that her clerks do not reflect the racial mix of Washington, D.C.) But liberals think other peoples jobs are a joke, so the testing must also be a joke. That is  other than their preferred test: ""Is the applicant black, female or otherwise handicapped?"" There is no test that can prove all things about an employee and so there is no test that cant be derided by the race-mongers. Which is exactly the point. Get rid of all tests  except for lawyers who graduated at the top of their law school classes at Columbia, like Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Then liberals are free to impose racial quotas on other peoples jobs without limit. As crazy as this is, even Ginsburg and the other dissenters made a big point of pretending there was some flaw in this particular test. None adopted Sotomayors position that unequal test results alone prove discrimination. This suggests that a wise Jewish lady, due to the richness of her life experiences, might come to a better judgment than a Latina judge would.

2,Texas nonprofit has received $1.5 billion in federal money to run shelters for immigrant children,"A Southwest Key spokeswoman, Cindy Casares, has said the nonprofit is pleased with its overall record and takes action when a staff member isnt up to the job. In the last three years, Southwest Key UM shelter programs have been evaluated for compliance on 73,292 standards and we are proud to say that less than 1 percent of those resulted in a deficiency, she said in a written statement. However, we take each of the deficiencies seriously by self-reporting to invite external investigations as well as performing our own internal investigations. When called for, staff have been terminated or retrained as we continue to strive for excellence in the services we provide to the children entrusted to our care. One former Southwest Key employee has drawn national attention in the last week for his allegation that he had been ordered to separate three siblings who were hugging at a shelter for undocumented children in Arizona. Antar Davidson said the incident made him realize his time working with Southwest Key needed to end. I was told that they should not be able to hug, Davidson told CNN about the incident involving a girl and her two brothers. And [I] basically realized that being in Southwest Key ... despite the good I was doing, would mean that I had basically come up to doing things I felt were morally wrong.

20,How Trump Came to Enforce a Practice of Separating Migrant Families,"But Mr. Miller has expressed none of the presidents misgivings. No nation can have the policy that whole classes of people are immune from immigration law or enforcement, he said during an interview in his West Wing office this past week. It was a simple decision by the administration to have a zero tolerance policy for illegal entry, period. The message is that no one is exempt from immigration law. The administrations critics are not buying that explanation. This is not a zero tolerance policy, this is a zero humanity policy, and we cant let it go on, said Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon. Ripping children out of their parents arms to inflict harm on the child to influence the parents, he added, is unacceptable. Beyond those moral objections, Jeh C. Johnson, who as secretary of homeland security was the point man for the Obama administrations own struggles with illegal immigration, argued that deterrence, in and of itself, is neither practical nor a long-term solution to the problem. Ive seen this movie before, and I feel like what we are doing now, with the zero tolerance policy and separating parents and children for the purpose of deterrence, is banging our heads against the wall, he said. Whether its family detention, messaging about dangers of the journey, or messaging about separating families and zero tolerance, its always going to have at best a short-term reaction. And that view was based on hard experience. When Central American migrants, including many unaccompanied children, began surging across the border in early 2014, Mr. Obama, the antithesis of his impulsive successor, had his own characteristic reaction: He formed a multiagency team at the White House to figure out what should be done.",TRUE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/stephen-miller-descendant-asylum-seekers-fled-anti-semitic-violence/,Politics,Snopes

For weeks, the topic has dominated headlines and sparked what seems like coordinated outrage among liberals. Apparently oblivious to the fact that the Obama administration detained minors at the border for years, the left has pointed fingers instead at President Donald Trump for enforcing regulations that were enacted before he was even president.

This is akin to being outraged because police dont throw the children of suspects in jail with their parents during arrests, but instead take them into protective environments. The left-leaning media The left-leaning media stayed strangely silent when the detention of migrant children went on for years before Trump took office and now it looks like they also kept quiet when Barack Obamas administration literally placed immigrant children in the hands of human traffickers just a few years ago.

The Obama administration was appallingly lax at conducting even basic checks about the adults who showed up to claim migrant children. As detention centers became incapable of housing the massive influx of migrants, the [Obama-run] Department of Health and Human Services started placing children into the care of sponsors who would oversee the minors until their bids for refugee status could be reviewed, explained New York magazine, again confirming that the detention of child migrants took place long before Trump.

There are no easy or magic answers on how to enforce U.S. border laws while being humane and compassionate to innocent kids dragged into the chaos by adults. Its a difficult situation from any angle.

72,"Pressure Builds on HBO, Bill Maher After Host Uses Racial Slur on Real Time  Variety","Bill Maher apologized and HBO scolded him publicly. But will that be enough to quiet the storm over Mahers use of a racial slur during Fridays edition of Real Time with Bill Maher? Public outrage swelled following Fridays 10 p.m. live airing of Real Time with Bill Maher. HBO issued a statement Saturday calling the hosts use of the phrase Im a house n during an interview with Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse completely inexcusable and tasteless. HBO said the remark would be edited out of subsequent airings of the episode. Maher made the comment in jest after Sasse invited Maher to spend a day working in the fields of Nebraskas farms. Maher acknowledged that the N-word was offensive and said he regretted using it. Friday nights are always my worst night of sleep because Im up reflecting on the things I should or shouldnt have said on my live show. Last night was a particularly long night as I regret the word I used in the banter of a live moment, he said in a statement issued Saturday. By multiple accounts, HBO has no plans to take any action against Maher, who has been a mainstay at the network since 2003. A source noted that Maher has rarely offered any kind of mea culpa for provocative comments. Most recently, he stood firm in the face of harsh criticism for his decision to have the controversial blogger Milo Yiannopoulos, known for his racially charged online postings, as a guest on his show. The formal apology for using the N-word indicates that he recognizes that a line was crossed, something that was important to HBO. Related Bill Maher Apologizes for Using N-Word on HBOs Real Time HBO Calls Bill Mahers Use of N-Word Completely Inexcusable and Tasteless But the fury voiced on social media after Fridays airing stirred up examples of past statements from Maher about Muslims and the LGBTQ community that were widely deemed offensive. ThinkProgress, the editorial arm of the liberal Center for American Progress Action Fund, posted an article declaring Bill Maher has been a public racist for a long time with links to past clips from Real Time. The anger is an echo of the groundswell that led to the ouster in April of Bill OReilly, after the New York Times published an expose on sexual harassment allegations leveled at the Fox News host. It also has a parallel in Mahers past. Mahers ABC late-night show Politically Incorrect was axed after five years in June 2002 following Mahers observation that the U.S.s post-9/11 bombing campaigns against terrorist targets were cowardly acts. The comment sparked advertiser defections from the show  a pressure point that cant be used in the commercial-free environment of HBO. But at a moment of great political and cultural strife in the country, inflammatory statements and actions have been the undoing of numerous public figures. Just this past week, Kathy Griffin was forced to apologize amid a tidal wave of criticism from both the right and the left when she posed for a photo with a prop depicting President Trumps bloodied, severed head. Despite her apology, that stunt quickly cost Griffin her gig co-hosting CNNs New Years Eve coverage with Anderson Cooper. For Maher, another damaging video clip making the rounds on Saturday is an interview with comedian Wayne Brady from HuffPost Live in 2012, after Brady and Maher tangled over the latters assertion that Brady was a non-threatening black man. Brady said the comment indicates that Maher has a stereotypical view of black men as menacing. When I talk to you again, Ill give you that black dude and I will beat your ass in public, Brady said of Maher in 2012. Maher and Real Time have long been highly regarded in industry circles for the hosts willingness to confront thorny issues. The show earned consecutive Emmy noms for best talk-variety show from 2005 through 2014, and was nommed again in 2016. Reaction from viewers and industry insiders via social media to Mahers comment was, not surprisingly, fast and furious, and overwhelmingly negative. But Maher does have prominent supporters, such as author and Georgetown University professor Michael Eric Dyson. Dyson condemned Mahers use of the N-word but defended his record of offering a platform to an array of African-American perspectives on politics and culture. Given the Bill Maher I know, he will use this opportunity to strengthen his role as an ally to black people, Dyson wrote. Spike Lee, meanwhile, had mixed feelings about the comedian. Oh, him using the n-word? I think its problematic. Ill leave it at that, he told Variety at a Brooklyn event on Saturday. I like Bill Maher, but I dont know if he should have used the n-word.

On Tuesday, Mr Trump continued his war of words against Mr Trudeau, saying the Canadian leader's stance against the US would cost his Canada ""a lot of money"". Mr Trump had earlier posted a string of tweets attacking Mr Trudeau's personality just hours after leaving the divisive G7 summit in Quebec. ""[He] acted so meek and mild,"" he said. ""Very dishonest and weak."" Mr Trump's latest comments have elicited many apologies from Americans who disagree with his hard-line approach. Actor Robert De Niro, who was in Canada for a restaurant opening, apologised to a crowd for ""the idiotic behaviour of my president"". ""I apologise to Justin Trudeau and the other people at the G7,"" he said as the crowd cheered in Toronto. Even the city's mayor John Tory thanked the actor for his remarks. On social media #ThanksCanada was trending, as Americans online expressed their gratitude for their northern neighbour and distanced themselves from their president. Mr Trump's comments continue to provide fodder for columnists from some of Canada's top newspapers. ""The strongest bilateral relationship in the world is in a ditch and there's no clear way to get out,"" wrote Globe and Mail columnist Margaret Wente. ""Reasoning and logic won't help. You might as well try to reason with a two-tonne two-year old with a tantrum."" A columnist for La Presse, another French-language daily, said Canada's relationship with the US has never been so threatened in the country's modern history. ""Unlike those who preceded him in recent decades, Donald Trump is no friend to Canada,"" writes Alexandre Sirois. ""He does not wish us well."" In Maclean's magazine, columnist Scott Gilmore called on Canadians to hit Mr Trump ""where it hurts"" by boycotting his businesses. Mr Trump's insults even managed to unite Canada's political parties, spurring Mr Trudeau's political enemies leapt to his defence. On Monday, members of Parliament in Canada's House of Commons unanimously passed a motion in support of retaliatory measures against the US metals tariffs and to ""reject disparaging and ad hominem statements by US officials which do a disservice to bilateral relations and work against efforts to resolve this trade dispute"". The leader of Canada's opposition Conservative Party accused the US of ""divisive rhetoric and personal attacks"". Doug Ford, who was recently elected premier of Ontario, tweeted his support for Mr Trudeau. Jason Kenney, the leader of the United Conservative Party, and leader of the opposition in the province of Alberta, tweeted out an old clip of former president Ronald Reagan saying that America's peaceful allies ""are not our enemies"". Federal Green Party leader Elizabeth May said that all Canadian leaders should rally behind Mr Trudeau. The spat began shortly after the G7 summit concluded, when Mr Trudeau gave a press conference vowing retaliatory action next month over US tariffs on steel and aluminium. Mr Trump then unleashed a series of tweets personally attacking the Canadian PM. Those first tweets spurred most Canadian newspapers to run angry editorials denouncing Mr Trump. ""He sulked his way through the first part of the meeting, gave his delegation the OK to sign the summit's pallid final communiqu, then threw a hissy fit and tore it up,"" the Toronto Star said.

""Mr Trump set an antagonistic tone for the summit by announcing, just prior to it, steep tariffs on Canadian and European steel and aluminium,"" it said. French language daily Le Journal de Montreal said Mr Trudeau ""became the scapegoat of Donald Trump and his advisers"".

Canada does not conduct its diplomacy through ad hominem attacks. We dont think that that is a useful or productive way to do business, Ms. Freeland said. But she said that Ottawa wont be bullied and will hit back with $16-billion of retaliatory tariffs if the U.S. does not rescind its penalties on steel and aluminum imposed last week.

Mr. Trump also targeted the G7s trade efforts, tweeting Monday Fair trade is now to be called fool trade if it is not reciprocal, also saying Sorry, we cannot let our friends, or enemies, take advantage of us on trade anymore. We must put the American worker first! Mr. Trumps top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, told CNN on Sunday that the President was furious after he left the G7 summit early and learned that Mr. Trudeau had told a wrap-up news conference that Canada would not be pushed around. In an extraordinary assault on one of Americas closest allies, Mr. Kudlow accused the Prime Minister of betraying the U.S. President and making him look weak on the eve of the historic summit with North Korea. He really kind of stabbed us in the back, Mr. Kudlow said and emphasized that the President is not going to let a Canadian prime minister push him around.  He is not going to permit any show of weakness on a trip to negotiate with North Korea.  Kim must not see American weakness. Mr. Trudeau, along with other G7 leaders, had endorsed the Presidents gamble to denuclearize North Korea. Story continues below advertisement White House trade adviser Peter Navarro was even harsher, telling Fox News that there was a special place in hell for any foreign leader that engages in bad-faith diplomacy with Donald J. Trump and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out the door and that is what Justin Trudeau did. In his Saturday tweet, Mr. Trump threatened to impose the same stiff tariffs on automobile exports from Canada and Europe  which would cripple the Canadian auto industry. Mr. Trumps advisers warned that the North American free-trade deal was also in jeopardy. Based on Justins false statements at his news conference, and the fact that Canada is charging massive Tariffs to our U.S. farmers, workers and companies, I have instructed our U.S. Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the U.S. Market!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 9, 2018 That was one of the worst political miscalculations in Canadian history, Mr. Navarro said, while Mr. Kudlow added: How many times has the President said if you hit me, I will hit you back.  A senior Canadian official said that Mr. Trumps outburst came out of left field, since Mr. Trudeau had already announced reciprocal tariffs last week. Canada is uncertain whether the dispute could lead to a trade war and is particularly concerned if the U.S. imposes tariffs on Canadian autos, which the official said would be disastrous for both countries. Ms. Freeland brushed off the White House tirades and discounted the threat that NAFTA is dead. Mr. Trump said on Saturday that a deal was close on a sunset clause that would reopen NAFTA after five years, but Mr. Trudeau later refuted the President, saying Canada could never agree to that provision. A trade deal with a sunset clause is not a trade deal and therefore we will not accept a sunset clause of five, ten or whatever duration that is proposed by the President, Mr. Trudeau said. The U.S.-Canada rift erupted after Mr. Trump left the G7 summit to head to his much-anticipated meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. At a news conference, Mr. Trudeau condemned the Presidents steel and aluminum actions as destructive and even illegal. Mr. Trump was on Air Force One en route to that meeting in Singapore on Saturday when he fired off two blistering tweets. He ordered U.S. officials to pull out of a joint G7 communiqu that spoke about fair and balanced trade and told them to examine the imposition of tariffs on foreign automobiles coming into the U.S. market. PM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our @G7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that, US Tariffs were kind of insulting and he will not be pushed around.  Mr. Trump tweeted. The senior Canadian official said other G7 leaders have rallied behind Mr. Trudeau. Key U.S. politicians and Canadian political opponents are also backing the Prime Minister. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Mr. Trumps withdrawal from the G7 communiqu via Twitter is of course sobering and a little depressing  and warned that Europe will forge ahead with reciprocal tariffs like Canada. The office of French President Emmanuel Macron said: International co-operation cannot be dictated by fits of anger and throwaway remarks. U.S. Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein called Mr. Trumps outburst a big mistake, while Republican Senator John McCain said the Presidents behaviour toward his G7 allies was wrong. Appearing on Fox News on Sunday, former prime minister Stephen Harper urged Mr. Trump to stop picking trade fights with Canada and join forces to push China to open its markets. Us fighting over our trade relationship when the Chinese have a four-to-one imbalance with both of us is, in my judgment, just the wrong priority, he said. NDP MP Charlie Angus called Mr. Trump a small-minded man not fit for public office. Canada will not be pushed around by his circus-thug bluster. Incoming Ontario Conservative premier Doug Ford said he stood shoulder to shoulder with Mr. Trudeau as did Albertas United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney. Mr. Trump, who arrived late and left the G7 summit, in La Malbaie, Que., early, was unmoved by concerted efforts to persuade him to reverse his tariffs. He warned that Canadian and European reciprocal tariffs aimed at U.S. goods and services would be met with new levies. We are like the piggy bank that everyone is robbing and that ends, Mr. Trump told reporters on Saturday. Before departing for Singapore, Mr.Trump again called for Russia to be reinstated in the G7. Mr. Harper, who led the charge to oust Russia from the G7 in 2014 after its annexation of Crimea, said President Vladimir Putin should not be allowed back into an alliance of liberal democracies.

85,Trumps zero tolerance at the border is causing child shelters to fill up fast,"Families who illegally crossed the Mexico-U.S. border turn themselves in to U.S. Border Patrol agents near McAllen, Tex., on May 9. (Loren Elliott/Reuters) The number of migrant children held in U.S. government custody without their parents has surged 21 percent in the past month, according to the latest figures, an increase driven by the Trump administrations zero tolerance crackdown on families who cross the border illegally. Although the government has not disclosed how many children have been separated from their parents as a result of the new measures, the Department of Health and Human Services said Tuesday that it had 10,773 migrant children in its custody, up from 8,886 on April 29. Under the zero tolerance approach rolled out last month by Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, anyone who crosses into the United States illegally will face criminal prosecution. In most cases, that means parents who arrive with children stay in federal jails while their children are sent to HHS shelters. Those shelters are at 95 percent capacity, an HHS official said Tuesday, and the agency is preparing to add potentially thousands of new bed spaces in the coming weeks. HHS also is exploring the possibility of housing children on military bases but views the measure as a last option, according to the HHS official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the agencys preparations. HHS has about 1,300 reserve beds to accommodate more children, the official said, including several hundred at a government-owned building in Homestead, Fla., adjacent to an Air Force base previously used as a Labor Department training center. In a statement, Kenneth J. Wolfe, a spokesman for HHSs Administration for Children and Families, said that the agency has an existing network of approximately 100 shelters in 14 states and that additional temporary housing is only sought as a last resort when current locations are reaching capacity. The latest figures do not distinguish between minors who arrive without a parent and those who are separated from their mothers and fathers after they cross the border. But an official for U.S. Customs and Border Protection testified at a Senate committee hearing last week that 638 adults were referred for prosecution between May 6 and May 19 under the new zero-tolerance effort and that they brought 658 children with them. As the scope of the family- separation measures becomes clearer, President Trumps immigration advisers pushed back Tuesday at false or misleading stories about their policies that circulated widely on social media over the weekend. Many seized on reports that HHS lost 1,475 children last year, describing them as missing. But those reports were based on misleading characterizations of a follow-up phone survey conducted by HHS when it attempted to reach the adult sponsors of migrant children 30 days after releasing them to the sponsors. HHS does not have a formal responsibility to track children once they are released to sponsors. Agency officials say that is the immigration court systems job. And because many adult sponsors, including parents, are living in the country illegally, they may fear contact with federal officials. In the last fiscal year, in 14 percent of those calls, the family didnt answer the phone, a top HHS official, Steven Wagner, told reporters Tuesday. But theres no reason to believe that anything has happened to the kids. If you call a friend and they dont answer the phone, you dont assume that theyve been kidnapped. Trump officials also gave new details Tuesday about an agreement between HHS and the Department of Homeland Security that immigrant advocates warn could further increase the number of children in federal custody and how long they stay there. The agreement will give Homeland Security more access to the personal information of parents, relatives or other adult sponsors seeking custody of the children. In the past, that information was largely walled off for the purposes of immigration enforcement while the sponsors were vetted by HHS, out of a concern that Homeland Securitys involvement could have a chilling effect on parents living in the country illegally and discourage them from claiming the kids. But under Trump, senior officials at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have recommended such measures to deter parents from attempting to send for their children while knowing they can get custody with little fear of deportation. Wendy Young, president of the advocacy group Kids in Need of Defense, said Homeland Security is injecting a law enforcement approach into this system, one that will strain HHS bed space. Homeland Security officials declined to say Tuesday whether the information will be used to target parents for arrest and deportation, characterizing the new measures as an effort to protect children. If somebody is unwilling to claim their child from custody because theyre concerned about their own immigration status, I think that de facto calls into question whether theyre an adequate sponsor and whether we should be releasing a child to that person, Wagner said. Plus, we have the problem of people fraudulently claiming to be parents when, in fact, theyre not, he added, saying the agreement would give the agency better tools to check sponsors backgrounds and verify their identities. In recent months, the average time children spent at HHS shelters increased from 51 to 56 days, according to the agencys latest statistics. Last year, HHS took custody of more than 40,000 migrant children, and the agencys Office of Refugee Resettlement said it released 93 percent to adult sponsors. In half of those cases, the adult sponsor was one of the childs parents, and another 40 percent were close adult relatives. Jonathan Rath Hoffman, chief spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, described the Trump administrations determination to prosecute parents as a continuation of Obama-era measures. This policy has not changed from the prior administration, he said. In 2016, more than 20 percent of those who crossed the border illegally faced criminal charges, according to Homeland Security data. During President Barack Obamas second term, the government prosecuted roughly 70,000 cases per year. Those figures do not indicate how many arrived with children. Trump critics say that claim is specious and obfuscates the current administrations break with standard practice. Whats happened is the exception to the rule is now becoming the rule, said Young, who said prosecutions under Obama were far more selective. Here theyre doing zero-tolerance policy to punish families and send a message to their home countries: Dont do this. Its so disingenuous to couch this as a continuation of Obamas policies, Young said. This is the most aggressive response to Central American migration weve seen to date. Trump has lashed out at Nielsen and other aides because the number of people illegally crossing the Mexican border has spiked, robbing his ability to campaign on promises of improved border security. White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly first floated the idea of separating families last year, calling it a tool to discourage migrants from attempting the journey. More recently, he caused an uproar when he appeared to dismiss experts warnings that separating children from their parents inflicts emotional and psychological damage to the kids, saying theyll be taken care of  put into foster care or whatever. In a tweet Saturday, Trump portrayed the family-separation measures as a tactic to arm-twist his opponents. Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there [sic] parents once they cross the Border into the U.S., he wrote. Trump called the practice horrible, so if he thinks its so horrible he ought to end it and not make children pawns as a negotiating tool, said Lee Gelernt, an immigration attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, which has filed a class-action lawsuit to force the government to stop separating families at the border. Little kids are begging and screaming not to be taken from parents, and theyre hauled off, Gelernt said. Parents are telling their older kids, Be brave, be brave.

102,Georgia Congressman berated for tweeting D-Day photo with Nazi soldiers,"Georgia Congressman Drew Ferguson was lambasted on social media Wednesday after his campaign tweeted a D-Day photo that depicted Nazi soldiers rather than American troops. The West Point Republicans campaign tweeted the black-and-white picture shortly before 7 a.m., which included the soldiers in front of a tank that featured the Iron Cross, a German military symbol. The heroism of our own troops  was matched by that of the armed forces of the nations that fought by our side  they absorbed the blows  and they shared to the full in the ultimate destruction of the enemy, the first-term congressman tweeted, quoting President Harry Truman. The posting was deleted shortly after a top staffer from the progressive super PAC American Bridge, which bills itself as holding Republicans accountable, replied that the troops were Nazi solders. Ferguson spokesman Dan McLagan said the image was selected by an intern at a digital media company that works with the congressmans campaign. As a patriot and the father of a daughter serving in the Navy, Drew is pretty furious about it, McLagan said in an e-mail. We deleted the post immediately but the sentiment of heartfelt gratitude and reverence for the men who charged into withering fire on those beaches 74 years ago can never be erased from our hearts. Members of Congress frequently employ staff members to handle their social media accounts  especially younger aides who might not immediately recognize the outward curve of the German helmets. But the gaffe still stings given that events such as D-Day and Pearl Harbor remain important cultural and historical markers, especially among older voters. Theres also a tinge of irony. Fergusons 3rd Congressional District is home to Newnan, the quiet community which was the site of a neo-Nazi rally in April. Turnout for the event, organized by a Detroit-based fascist organization, was small, our colleagues reported at the time. Ferguson condemned the rally. Every citizen has the constitutional right to express their First Amendment freedoms to free speech and protest, but the racist views of neo-Nazis are completely abhorrent, he said ahead of the event.

113,Congressional Candidate In Virginia Admits Hes A Pedophile,"Nathan Larson, a 37-year-old accountant from Charlottesville, Virginia, is running for Congress as an independent candidate in his native state. He is also a pedophile, as he admitted to HuffPost on Thursday, who has bragged in website posts about raping his late ex-wife. In a phone call, Larson confirmed that he created the now-defunct websites suiped.org and incelocalypse.today  chat rooms that served as gathering places for pedophiles and violence-minded misogynists like himself. HuffPost contacted Larson after confirming that his campaign website shared an IP address with these forums, among others. His sites were terminated by their domain host on Tuesday. On the phone, he was open about his pedophilia and seemingly unfazed about his long odds of attaining government office. A lot of people are tired of political correctness and being constrained by it, he said. People prefer when theres an outsider who doesnt have anything to lose and is willing to say whats on a lot of peoples minds. When asked whether hes a pedophile or just writes about pedophilia, he said, Its a mix of both. When people go over the top theres a grain of truth to what they say. Asked whether there was a grain of truth in his essay about father-daughter incest and another about raping his ex-wife repeatedly, he said yes, offering that plenty of women have rape fantasies. NathanLarsonorg Nathan Larson is running for Congress as an independent in Virginia. In an interview with HuffPost, he was open about his pedophilia. According to Larsons campaign manifesto, his platform as a quasi-neoreactionary libertarian candidate includes protecting gun ownership rights, establishing free trade and protecting benevolent white supremacy, as well as legalizing incestuous marriage and child pornography. In the manifesto, Larson called Nazi leader Adolf Hitler a white supremacist hero. He urged Congress to repeal the Violence Against Women Act, adding, We need to switch to a system that classifies women as property, initially of their fathers and later of their husbands. He also showed sympathy for men who identify as involuntary celibates, or incels, suggesting it is unfair that they are forced to pay taxes for schools, welfare, and other support for other mens children. Using the pseudonyms Leucosticte and Lysander, Larson frequently participated in conversations on his own message boards, he confirmed to HuffPost. suiped org Larson posted as ""Lysander"" on his now-defunct website, suiped.org. As Lysander on suiped.org, a forum for suicidal pedophiles, Larson wrote numerous posts endorsing child rape and other forms of sexual abuse. Why doesnt every pedo just focus on making money so they can get a pedo-wife and then either impregnate her with some fucktoys or adopt some fucktoys? he wrote on the platform in October. That would accommodate both those who are and arent into incest. And of course, the adoption process lets you pick a boy or a girl. Larson has a 3-year-old daughter who lives with relatives. He told HuffPost that he relinquished his parental rights during a custody battle. His ex-wife got a court-ordered restraining order against him in 2015 before she died by suicide. He has since remarried, he says, and is now living in Catlett, Virginia. Larson used the moniker Leucosticte on incelocalypse.today  a forum for incels who are pedophiles that was removed this week after the website Babe contacted the domain host. There, he identified as a hebephilic rapist, noting that hes not a typical incel because hed had sex by raping his ex-wife. According to the site, which HuffPost viewed before it was taken down, incelocalypse refers to the day we make the jailbaits our rape-slaves. (The term jailbait is slang for a person who is under the legal age of consent for sex.) incelocalypse today Larson posted as ""Leucosticte"" on incelocalypse.today. HuffPost did not view any posts explicitly stating that he has engaged in sexual activity with minors, although he repeatedly expressed a desire to have sex with infants and children, including his own daughter. In the phone call, Larson said that the word pedophile is vague and just a label, adding that its normal for men to be attracted to underage women. He said he did not commit any crimes. In a 3,300-word essay on incelocalypse.today, titled Heres How to Psyche Yourself Up to Feel Entitled to Rape, Larson tells other members: Dont forget: feminism is the problem, and rape is the solution. On the platform, he also advocated for father-daughter marriage, killing women and raping virgins. Larson is less worried about his run for Congress than about his sites coming down. He told HuffPost that the termination of his websites is an affront to his freedom of speech and that hes going to try to get them hosted elsewhere. Not that itll matter  there are still plenty of forums where incels and other such communities can congregate. The removal of Larsons sites caused an uproar on incels.me, a separate, much larger forum for incels. Larsons political ambitions span more than a decade. He first ran for Congress in Virginias 1st District in 2008 on what he described as an anarcho-capitalist platform. That same year, he sent a letter to the Secret Service threatening to kill the president, which landed him in federal prison for 14 months and barred him from seeking public office in Virginia (convicted felons are free to run for federal office). But in 2016, then-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) restored voting and other civil rights to thousands of felons, allowing Larson to run for state office. In 2017 he ran in Virginias House of Delegates District 31 and secured less than 2 percent of the vote. Now he is gunning for a seat in Virginias 10th Congressional District.

130,Clear backpacks at schools skirts deeper problem  need for gun control | Letters,"I was reading the Sun Sentinel on Monday and came across Dan Sweeney's article titled ""Are clear backpacks at Stoneman Douglas an effective deterrent? Are they a privacy issue?"" I absolutely think it would be a privacy issue. The students, in general, did not do anything wrong and I feel this tactic would only criminalize them and make the school more of a prison than a safe learning environment. The issue, as I see it, is the lack of attention to a child who is crying for help. Without passing any blame, I strongly believe that it is a group effort to monitor and pay attention to such children. I also think the staff should evaluate the environment the individual is raised in, their history, etc., to see why they may be exhibiting certain questionable behavior and to address potential issues.

0,Israel upholds use of surveillance technology on protesters,"JERUSALEM (AP) ��� Israel���s attorney general has upheld the Shin Bet security agency���s use of mobile-phone tracking technology to monitor and threaten Palestinian protesters at Jerusalem���s most sensitive holy site last year.

The decision, which came on Tuesday, drew harsh criticism from the civil rights group that challenged the use of the technology. The group warned that it would have a ���chilling effect��� on the country���s Arab minority.

The attorney general���s move was in response to a complaint over a series of text messages sent out last May to hundreds of Palestinians at the height of one of the city���s most turbulent periods in years. At the time, Palestinian protesters were clashing with Israeli police at the Al Aqsa Mosque in violence that helped spark an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip.

Using its tracking technology, the Shin Bet sent a text message to people who were determined to be in the area of the clashes and told them ���we will hold you accountable��� for acts of violence.

The recipients included both Palestinian residents of east Jerusalem, as well as Palestinian citizens of Israel. While some recipients had participated in the clashes, many others, such as people who lived, worked or prayed in the area, received the message erroneously and said they were surprised or scared by the message.

The Association for Civil Rights in Israel, a civil-society group, filed a complaint to the office of Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, urging him to halt the use of the technology. It cited the use of the tool on a large group of people and the threatening language of the text.

In its response, the attorney general���s office acknowledged there had been problems with the message, both with its language and because the mass distribution included unintended targets. But it said the use of the technology was a legitimate security tool and that the security service has revised its procedures to avoid similar mistakes in the future.

���After discussions with us on this subject, lessons were learned in the security agency and guidelines formulated in various aspects with the goal of preventing a recurrence of problems like this,��� said the opinion. It said the office planned no further intervention in the matter.

Tuesday was the final day of Mandelblit���s six-year term. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel, or ACRI, expressed disappointment with the ruling.

���They say they have the authority to continue sending these kind of texts to people,��� said Gil Gan-Mor, who heads the group���s unit on human rights in the digital age. ���We think differently.���

He said authorities have tools to investigate and prosecute people suspected in violence, but sending threatening messages was not the way to maintain security.

���Obviously this will have a chilling effect, to say the least, on practicing legitimate activities, like going to a protest or going to pray somewhere,��� he said. The group was studying the decision and would decide in the coming days whether to file an appeal to the Israeli Supreme Court, he added.

ACRI has previously filed legal challenges to the government���s use of the same Shin Bet tracking technology as a contact-tracing tool to prevent the spread of the coronavirus early in the pandemic.

Israel���s Supreme Court eventually restricted the use of the tool to specific cases, and studies have found that it was largely ineffective in identifying people with COVID-19.",TRUE,https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-technology-health-middle-east-jerusalem-add10954e1bd38eb68c3d7a7c276d48d,Politics,AP

0,Minneapolis Announces Plan To Replace Police Officers With Thousands Of Heavily Armed Social Workers,"MINNEAPOLIS���In an effort to regain the community���s trust and better allocate city resources, Mayor Jacob Frey announced Thursday that Minneapolis would dismantle its current police force and replace it with a new bureau of heavily armed social workers, effective immediately.

The mayor outlined a plan that dramatically restructured the municipality���s approach to public safety, replacing its nearly 850 police officers with a similar number of social workers, who would be dispatched to city streets and have at their disposal firearms, bulletproof vests, tear gas, armored vehicles with gun turrets, and other tools to enhance their service to the community.

���Minneapolis has demanded a new model of security, and so today we are reallocating the police department���s entire $193 million budget to clinical social workers, case managers, and crisis counselors,��� said Frey, confirming members of the newly created bureau would be issued service weapons and assigned to one of several precincts, the heads of which would report to a chief of social work. ���Why continue asking police to manage this city���s homelessness crisis, for example, when we can send in social workers���those actually trained in assisting housing-insecure people���to bulldoze our homeless camps and move the inhabitants out at gunpoint?���

���We have heard your call,��� Frey added, ���and rest-assured: The next time you contact the authorities, a licensed professional equipped with empathy, emotional intelligence, active listening skills, and a whole lot of firepower will be headed your way.���

Training for the new bureau reportedly includes instruction not only with Glock 20s and Colt M4 Carbines but also in takedown maneuvers, chokeholds, and baton techniques, all with the goal of enabling social workers to subdue any adversary encountered while conducting routine domestic checks, meeting with trauma survivors, or visiting a child welfare agency.

Recruits to the bureau acknowledged their work should be easier now that they have the capacity to immediately neutralize every potential threat in their path.

���As a substance abuse counselor, it���s nice to know that if one of my clients starts using again, I can just Taser them and confiscate their stash,��� said 47-year-old Cindy Hughes, who holds a master of social work degree from the College of St. Scholastica in Duluth and, in addition to a stun gun and sidearm, carries a Remington 700 sniper rifle in the trunk of her squad car. ���It���s so much easier than getting them to go to a meeting.���

���Usually, if I���m worried they���re trying to score, we discuss sober-living facilities and ways to avoid common relapse triggers,��� Hughes continued. ���Now I can make extra sure they stay off the streets by simply handcuffing them to their bunk at the halfway house.���

According to Mayor Frey, out-of-work former police officers would be eligible to join the social work bureau so long as they earned the appropriate credentials, which would allow them to bring their confrontational impulses and intimidation tactics into both outpatient behavioral health centers and foster care settings.

City officials said they also planned to disband the Minneapolis Police Canine Unit and replace it with a team of local therapy dogs, which would be trained extensively in clamping their jaws onto people���s legs and ripping apart their flesh.

Sheila Bickford, a family therapist in the city for the past 30 years, told reporters her words would carry more weight now that she could enter counseling sessions outfitted with body armor, a ballistic helmet, a riot shield, and a shotgun loaded with less-lethal rounds.

���You definitely get people���s attention when you touch down in front of their home in the Child and Family Services chopper,��� said Bickford, referring to her division���s UH-60 Black Hawk military surplus helicopter. ���They can either listen when I tell them codependency takes a toll on the well-being and quality of your relationships, or they can get knocked down and kicked in the head until they are completely unresponsive. It���s the easy way or the hard way.���

0,Historians Find Evidence Of Nation���s Founding Lobbyists��� Campaign To Influence Constitution,"WASHINGTON���Drawing on a trove of letters, diaries, and itemized receipts recently donated by private collectors, historians from Georgetown University published new evidence on Wednesday of the Founding Lobbyists��� intense behind-the-scenes campaign to influence the U.S. Constitution.

The documents reveal a concerted effort by America���s earliest corporate power brokers to curry favor with the Constitution���s framers during the 1787 Constitutional Convention all the way through the ratification of the Bill of Rights in 1791, with delegates having been pampered with gifts such as expensive pocket watches, casks of fine Caribbean molasses, and extravagant quail-hunting trips to the Province of Massachusetts Bay.

���It���s now becoming clear just how much the final language of the Constitution was shaped by, say, complimentary jugs of quality mead or all-expenses-paid gambling jaunts aboard company-owned schooners.���

���What we���ve learned is that these men���acting on behalf of cotton, barrel, and livestock interests, among many others���played a pivotal role in crafting the Constitution as we know it,��� said professor J. Wilson Adler, noting that, for example, the Third Amendment barring the nonconsensual quartering of soldiers was only added after James Madison was treated to a feast of succulent brisket and stewed pumpkin care of the powerful boardinghouse industry. ���For all the Founding Fathers��� brilliance and vision, it���s now becoming clear just how much the final language of the Constitution was shaped by, say, complimentary jugs of quality mead or all-expenses-paid gambling jaunts aboard company-owned schooners.���

���These lobbyists knew full well that if you wanted first-rate treatment for your patrons in Providence or Charleston, you made sure that gilded ivory walking canes found their way to the delegates gathered in Philadelphia,��� he added.

Evidence also suggests that the original lobbyists were skilled in dampening opposition to their clients��� agendas. Recovered ledgers revealed that an early attempt at universal healthcare���via a welfare clause in Article IV���was voted down after an advocate for the Apothecaries Guild procured front-row duel tickets for the entire Pennsylvania delegation.According to witness accounts of the time, the Constitution���s authors were regularly spotted in the colonies��� most exclusive taverns, where a different member of the wax or beaver pelt lobbies would cover their exorbitant three-figure tabs and lavish them with exquisite silk garments and spices from beyond the Orient. Preserved woodcuts depict a number of Founding Fathers relaxing on the palm-lined beaches of Hispaniola as they and their families enjoyed luxury accommodations courtesy of the sugarcane industry.

In addition, personal letters from Thomas Paine and John Adams credit the introduction of the Second Amendment to representatives of the Musket Manufacturers Association, which funded a series of vicious attack broadsheets targeting anyone who spoke out against it, accusing critics of being tyrannical monarchists who harbored a secret plot to seize the colonies��� flintlocks.

���Of course, the grandiose spending and backroom deals at the Constitutional Convention did lead to some scandals, like Benjamin Franklin being arrested in a courtesan house with a saddlebag of pure snuff that had been provided by tobacco growers,��� said Adler, adding that there was also widespread public outcry following revelations that the Slave Traders of America had donated ���1,500 prize hogs and 250 stout men of West African stock��� to certain delegates in exchange for an abolition amendment being dropped. ���Despite these unseemly episodes, Founding Fathers like William Livingston and Gouverneur Morris actually went on to become Founding Lobbyists themselves, using their insider knowledge to command thousands of gold guineas from the blacksmith and whale oil industries.���

0,Biden orders release of Trump White House logs to Congress,"WASHINGTON (AP) ��� President Joe Biden is ordering the release of Trump White House visitor logs to the House committee investigating the riot of Jan. 6, 2021, once more rejecting former President Donald Trump���s claims of executive privilege.

The committee has sought a trove of data from the National Archives, including presidential records that Trump had fought to keep private. The records being released to Congress are visitor logs showing appointment information for individuals who were allowed to enter the White House on the day of the insurrection.

In a letter sent Monday to the National Archives, White House counsel Dana Remus said Biden had considered Trump���s claim that because he was president at the time of the attack on the U.S. Capitol, the records should remain private, but decided that it was ���not in the best interest of the United States��� to do so.

She also noted that as a matter of policy, the Biden administration ���voluntarily discloses such visitor logs on a monthly basis,��� as did the Obama administration, and that the majority of the entries over which Trump asserted the claim would be publicly released under the current policy.

A Trump spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the decision.

The Presidential Records Act mandates that records made by a sitting president and his staff be preserved in the National Archives, and an outgoing president is responsible for turning over documents to the agency when leaving office. Trump tried but failed to withhold White House documents from the House committee in a dispute that was decided by the Supreme Court.

Biden has already made clear that he is not invoking executive privilege concerning the congressional investigation unless he absolutely must. Biden has waived that privilege for much other information requested by the committee, which is going through the material and obtaining documents and testimony from witnesses, including some uncooperative ones.

The committee is focused on Trump���s actions from Jan. 6, when he waited hours to tell his supporters to stop the violence and leave the Capitol. Investigators are also interested in the organization and financing of a Washington rally the morning of the riot, when Trump told supporters to ���fight like hell.��� Among the unanswered questions is how close organizers of the rally coordinated with White House officials.

Investigators also are seeking communications between the National Archives and Trump���s aides about 15 boxes of records that the agency recovered from Trump at his Florida resort and are trying to learn what they contained.

Meanwhile, White House call logs obtained so far by the House committee do not list calls made by Trump as he watched the violence unfold on television on Jan. 6, nor do they list calls made directly to the president.

That lack of information about Trump���s personal calls is a particular challenge as the investigators work to discern what the then-president was doing in the White House as supporters violently beat police, broke into the Capitol and interrupted the congressional certification of Democrat Joe Biden���s election victory.

There are several possible explanations for omissions in the records, which do not reflect conversations that Trump had on Jan. 6 with multiple Republican lawmakers, for example. Trump was known to use a personal cell phone or he could have had a phone passed to him by an aide. The committee is also continuing to receive records from the National Archives and other sources, which could produce additional information.",TRUE,https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-united-states-congress-dana-remus-833698eba6e222cdc3dfa128c44b0c99,Politics,AP
0,Jan. 6 panel subpoenas 6 more in fake GOP electors scheme,"WASHINGTON (AP) ��� The House committee investigating the U.S. Capitol insurrection subpoenaed six more people Tuesday, including former Trump campaign members and state lawmakers, as it further expands its review into efforts to falsely declare Donald Trump the winner of the 2020 election in several swing states.

The panel is seeking testimony and records from individuals who it says had knowledge of or participated in efforts to send false ���alternate electors��� from seven of the states President Joe Biden rightfully won.

���The Select Committee is seeking information about efforts to send false slates of electors to Washington and change the outcome of the 2020 election,��� Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, the committee���s Democratic chairman, said in a statement. ���We���re seeking records and testimony from former campaign officials and other individuals in various states who we believe have relevant information about the planning and implementation of those plans.���

The individuals subpoenaed include Michael Roman and Gary Michael Brown, who served as directors for Trump���s 2020 reelection campaign. The committee believes the two men reportedly promoted allegations of election fraud as well as encouraged state legislators to appoint false slates of electors.

The other four individuals are Pennsylvania State Sen. Douglas Mastriano, Laura Cox, the former chair of the Michigan Republican Party, Arizona State Rep. Mark Finchem and Arizona Republican Party chair Kelli Ward.

Messages requesting comment from Ward, Mastriano, Roman and Finchem were not immediately returned.

Two weeks ago, Ward and her husband filed a lawsuit against the House committee seeking to block a subpoena of their phone records. They were presidential electors who would have voted for Trump in the Electoral College had he won Arizona. Both signed a document falsely claiming they were Arizona���s true electors, despite Democrat Biden���s victory in the state. No decisions have been issued in the case.

Mastriano, a former Army officer currently seeking Pennsylvania���s Republican gubernatorial nomination, was among Trump���s most dedicated supporters during the 2020 campaign, helping organize and host a four-hour hearing post-election that was attended by Rudy Giuliani and that Trump addressed remotely.

Finchem was on Capitol grounds on Jan. 6, although he did not enter the building. He has been a vocal critic of the election results in Arizona, contending despite evidence to the contrary that Trump won in Arizona.

He is currently pushing a resolution in the state Legislature that seeks to overturn the state���s certification of the 2020 presidential election, listing a slew of debunked election fraud conspiracy theories. He is also seeking the Republican nomination to run for secretary of state, Arizona���s chief election officer.

The latest subpoenas come more than a month after the committee issued subpoenas to 14 people over the submission of false Electoral College certificates declaring Trump the winner of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

0,Senate confirms Biden���s FDA pick despite political divisions,"WASHINGTON (AP) ��� The Senate narrowly confirmed President Joe Biden���s pick to lead the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday pushing past a thicket of political controversies that threatened to derail what was initially expected to be an easy confirmation.

The 50-46 vote means Dr. Robert Califf, a cardiologist and prominent medical researcher, will again lead the powerful regulatory agency, which he briefly headed during the end of President Barack Obama���s administration.

The FDA hasn���t had a permanent leader in more than a year despite playing a central role in the COVID-19 response effort, reviewing the vaccines, drugs and tests used to fight the pandemic.

The razor-thin vote underscores the increasing political polarization around the health care issues FDA oversees and contrasts with Califf���s overwhelming support just six years ago. The Senate previously confirmed him to the job by a vote of 89-4.

Califf now inherits a raft of decisions pending at the agency, which regulates products that make up an estimated one fifth of all U.S. consumer spending, including prescription and over-the-counter drugs, medical devices, tobacco products and most foods.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration is ���thrilled��� that the Senate confirmed Califf on a bipartisan basis.

���He brings to this critical post a lifetime of knowledge and the institutional experience that will ensure he hits the ground running,��� she said.

Califf���s to-do list includes specific commitments he���s made to Senate lawmakers to clinch the job. In particular, he has vowed to quickly launch a comprehensive review of opioid painkillers like OxyContin, which helped trigger the worst drug epidemic in U.S. history after their FDA approval in the 1990s.

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., urged senators to oppose Califf, saying he bears ���a great deal of responsibility��� for many of the drug overdose deaths that have occurred in the years since his first stint as FDA commissioner. During his 11-month tenure, Califf added new warning labels to opioids and commissioned outside recommendations on how to tighten regulation of the drugs. But he was replaced by President Donald Trump before implementing any major changes.

���Nothing that Dr. Califf has said or done has led me to believe he will operate the FDA any differently than he did during his previous tenure,��� said Manchin, whose home state has been ravaged by the opioid epidemic for nearly 30 years. Four other lawmakers from hard-hit blue states also voted against Califf.

The White House long assumed enough Republicans would support Califf to easily overcome any Democratic defections, given his strong support from pharmaceutical companies and patient groups.

But anti-abortion advocates recently launched a campaign to sink his Senate vote, outraged by a recent FDA decision that eased access to abortion pills. Groups including the Susan B. Anthony List and Students for Life of America threatened to pull support from any Republican senators supporting Califf.

In the end, six Republicans joined with all but five Democrats in voting to confirm Califf. Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., advocated for Califf on the Senate floor, saying that he had not seen someone with such a short previous stint at the FDA who ���accomplished anything, much less the many negatives that have been raised.���

���He has the robust agency and private sector experience needed to help build on the success of the FDA in helping Americans get back to normal life with the approval of tests, vaccines and therapeutics that are bringing the pandemic to an end,��� Burr added. ���He���s the leader we need today, but also for the future.���

Dr. Janet Woodcock, the FDA���s longtime drug center director, had been serving as acting commissioner since last January. She announced Tuesday via Twitter that she would continue working at the agency as a principal deputy commissioner.

More than a year after authorizing the first COVID-19 vaccines, the FDA still faces several key decisions, including whether to expand their use to children younger than 5. Last week the FDA unexpectedly delayed its timeline for reviewing Pfizer���s vaccine for that age group.

FDA commissioners aren���t typically involved in day-to-day scientific reviews, but they serve as the go-between for the agency���s scientists and the White House. That relationship has strained over the past year as Biden���s COVID-19 task force has repeatedly gotten out ahead of the FDA���s methodical, scientific reviews.

Califf will also need to replace the head of the FDA���s tobacco center, which is weighing whether to ban e-cigarettes from Juul, Reynolds American and other vaping companies due to their use by teens. FDA tobacco���s longtime director, Mitch Zeller, is set to retire this spring.

The FDA is also crafting new regulations to ban menthol cigarettes, a long-sought goal for many Democratic lawmakers and public health advocates.

Califf has publicly championed the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives by embracing FDA���s authority to ban certain tobacco products and ingredients. Though the FDA has had those powers for more than a decade, its efforts to regulate both traditional cigarettes and e-cigarettes have been stymied by industry lawsuits.

Califf first came to the FDA after more than 35 years at Duke University, where he founded a contract research organization that conducts studies for many of the world���s largest drugmakers.

Since leaving government he has worked as a health policy adviser for Google and served as a board director or adviser to more than a half-dozen drug and biotech companies. In keeping with federal procedure, Califf agreed to resign from all of those positions and sell off investments in FDA-regulated companies, according to his ethics disclosures form.",TRUE,https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-business-health-barack-obama-robert-califf-7602db3a1196dda90d6745d0b1002c9c,Politics,AP
0,US approves new headlights that won���t blind oncoming drivers,"DETROIT (AP) ��� Anyone who has ever been temporarily blinded by high-beam headlights from an oncoming car will be happy to hear this.

U.S. highway safety regulators are about to allow new high-tech headlights that can automatically tailor beams so they focus on dark areas of the road and don���t create glare for oncoming drivers.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says it issued a final rule allowing what���s called ���adaptive driving beam headlights��� on new vehicles. It will go into effect when published in the Federal Register in the next few days.

The headlights, commonly used in Europe, have LED lamps that can focus beams on darkness such as the driver���s lane and areas along the roadside. They also lower the intensity of the light beams if there���s oncoming traffic. Camera sensors and computers help determine where the light should go.

���This final rule will improve safety for pedestrians and bicyclists by making them more visible at night, and will help prevent crashes by better illuminating animals and objects in and along the road,��� the agency said in a news release on Tuesday.

The new rule, which was supported by the auto industry, comes as the safety agency grapples with a dramatic rise in traffic deaths nationwide.

The number of U.S. traffic deaths surged in the first nine months of 2021 to 31,720, the government reported Tuesday, keeping up a record pace of increased dangerous driving during the coronavirus pandemic.

The estimated figure of people dying in motor vehicle crashes from January to September 2021 was 12% higher than the same period in 2020. That represents the highest percentage increase over a nine-month period since the Transportation Department began recording fatal crash data in 1975.

The tally of 31,720 deaths was the highest nine-month figure since 2006.

Sam Abuelsamid, principal mobility analyst for Guidehouse Research, said the new lights will show up in higher-cost luxury vehicles at first, but will spread to more mainstram vehicles as the price of the technology falls.

Currently Audi charges $3,000 for the top version of the lights in the U.S. on its e-tron Sportback electric vehicle. The adaptive beam lights are offered on most Audi models in the U.S., but until now, could not be used. An Audi spokesman says the company is evaluating whether the lights meet NHTSA standards and whether they can be activated in the future.

The technology uses an array of light emitting diodes that can change where light beams are sent, rather than the current technology of high beams hitting everywhere. ���You have the ability to basically create a light pattern on the fly that is optimized for real-time conditions,��� Abuelsamid said. ���You can cast the light where it���s most useful.���

The new lights also will help partially automated driver assist systems keep cars in their lanes and avoid objects in front of the vehicles at night, Abuelsamid said.

The new lighting regulation also comes more than 1 1/2 years ahead of a requirement in the bipartisan infrastructure law passed by Congress last year, NHTSA said.

In the past the agency has moved slowly on safety measures mandated by Congress. An Associated Press review last year of NHTSA���s rule-making activities under the last three presidents found at least 13 auto safety rules that are years overdue based on deadlines set in laws passed by Congress.

The agency has been without a Senate-confirmed administrator since early 2017. President Joe Biden has nominated former California air quality regulator Steven Cliff for the post.

���It is with a bit of sadness and a whole lot of relief that I announce that Michelle and I have decided to separate, as I have admitted to her, as I���m doing now to the rest of the world, that I am a homosexual,��� said Barack Obama. ���This may come as a shock to many, and anger others, but this is my personal business, and I would hope that everyone could respect my privacy at this time���

Representatives for Michelle Obama said that she and the former president would split amicably, and that Michelle herself was ���not particularly shocked��� by the revelation.

0,BREAKING: War With Iran Imminent; President Trump Reinstates Military Draft,"WASHINGTON, D.C. ���

Earlier this week, President Trump illegally ordered the assassination of a top military general in Iran, Qasem Soleimani, prompting Iran to promise a swift revenge. In the imminent face of war with a powerful military in Iran, President Trump reinstated the United States draft, last used during the Vietnam Conflict.

���There are a lot of incredible, selfless American men and women who have been serving in the armed forces, some for many years, some still in basic training,��� stated President Trump early this morning from the Oval Office. ���These people, they need help. They need a lot of really, really big help, and we need to make sure they receive it. Reinstating the United States draft process is the easiest, and most logical answer.���

The draft process, which chooses young, American men at random to enlist in the armed forces, is something most people thought they would never see used again, but military officials agree with Trump that it���s the most efficient way to quickly build our military forces in the face of danger.

���When you anger another country by committing a blatant and completely illegal war crime, such as the case with our President���s attack in Iran, things heat up quickly, and action must be taken,��� said Secretary of Defense Mark Esper. ���We are ready to have our young men suit up and join our military forces, and the reinstatement of the draft will help immensely.���

���It���s about time these lazy millennials do something with their life other than eat Tide pods and watch YouTube videos,��� said MAGA-hat wearing, Trump voter Carl Richards, 42, from Atlanta. ���They could use the direction, the discipline, and should want to fight to protect our country from foreign invasion. It���s what I would have done when I was their age. Not doing it now, of course. Got myself some really tender soles, and I can���t walk for too long before my feet really start to hurt. If it wasn���t for that, I���d be out there signing up to shoot me some towelheads or whoever it is this time.���",FALSE,https://empirenews.net/breaking-war-with-iran-imminent-president-trump-reinstates-military-draft/,Politics,Empirenews

Cosby, who is a lifelong friend of President Trump, could have spent his final days in prison had Trump not stepped in.

���Bill is absolutely and without a doubt, innocent on all charges,��� said President Trump. ���I understand very well how our court system works. I probably understand better than anyone, but that doesn���t matter. What matters is that I have met with Bill, we have spoken at length about the accusations against him, and I don���t believe a word of them.���

Over 60 women came forward to say that Bill Cosby had assaulted them, with many being drugged and raped while unconscious.

���We all know women like to gab, and this is a perfect example of why I plan to lower the crimes associated with assault or rape,��� said Trump. ���It���s obvious in this case that Bill had consensual sex with a woman who later regretted it, and then accused him of rape. Afterwards, of course, dozens of other women knew they could also try and make a dime off the publicity, and accused him as well. It���s sickening ��� truly sick ��� how some people think.���

0,"Tech exec used access to White House computers to look for dirt on Trump, says special counsel","A tech executive ���exploited��� his access to computer data at the White House to find ���derogatory information��� about President Donald Trump, a special counsel appointed during the Trump administration said in a court filing Friday.

John Durham, appointed by then-Attorney General William Barr in 2020 to probe the origins of the FBI���s investigation of Russian election interference, said ���Tech Executive-1,��� not named in the filing but first identified by The New York Times as Rodney Joffe, used his access to domain name system, or DNS, data to compile information about which computers and servers the White House servers were communicating with.

Trump and his allies said the disclosure was proof that Trump was under surveillance while he was in office. ���They were spying on the sitting president of the United States,��� Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told Fox News on Sunday. ���And it goes right to the Clinton campaign.��� In a statement Monday, Trump said the alleged spying was ���the biggest story of our time, bigger than Watergate.���

Image: Kevin McCarthy Holds Press Conference After Dispute Over Jan 6th Committee Members

The filing does not specify whether any of the data collection occurred while Trump was in office. It also does not allege that the content of any communications from the Executive Office of the President (EOP) or any parties were compromised or read and there���s no indication data collection went beyond identifying where the internet traffic came from and where it went.

Cybersecurity expert Rob Graham told NBC News that what Joffe appeared to have been doing was a search for domain names and addresses to which a computer had tried to connect.

When you type in the name of a website like Google.com, Graham said, DNS will translate it to a specific IP address and a specific group of servers. Monitoring such traffic reveals only that one computer or server is trying to reach another, he said, not the contents of a person���s screen or messages.

FEB. 14, 202203:51
The disclosure about Joffe, who has not been charged, came in a filing in the court case of Michael Sussmann, a lawyer whom Durham���s office indicted in September in connection with allegations of lying about his relationship with the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. 

In the filing Friday, prosecutors said ���Tech Executive-1��� gave Sussmann data about communications between computer servers at the EOP, two Trump-owned buildings in New York and an unrelated medical firm with Russian-made cellphones near the White House.

According to prosecutors, Sussmann gave the data to an unnamed federal agency at a meeting on Feb. 9, 2017, 20 days into the Trump administration, and said the data ���demonstrated that Trump and/or his associates were using supposedly rare, Russian-made wireless phones in the vicinity of the White House and other locations.���

���The Special Counsel���s Office has identified no support for these allegations,��� the filing said.

According to prosecutors, Sussmann did not disclose to the agency, identified by the Times as the CIA, that he was working for a client when he provided the report, when he was actually representing ���Tech Executive-1,��� aka Joffe.

Legal experts said Sussmann could face additional legal exposure if he failed to disclose his relationship to Joffe.

On Monday, attorneys for Sussmann filed a response to the special counsel���s Friday filing, in which they alleged the special counsel had attempted to create the impression that Sussmann had provided the CIA with data collected from the White House during Trump���s presidency ��� despite knowing that data given to the agency dated from the Obama administration.

���Although the Special Counsel implies that in Mr. Sussmann���s February 9, 2017 meeting, he provided Agency-2 with EOP data from after Mr. Trump took office,��� said the attorney, ���the Special Counsel is well aware that the data provided to Agency-2 pertained only to the period of time before Mr. Trump took office, when Barack Obama was President.���

The attorneys also said that Sussmann never billed the Clinton campaign for the February meeting with the CIA, nor could he have because the campaign had effectively ceased to exist.

Sussmann���s attorneys told the court, ���This is not the first time in this case that the Special Counsel has sought to include allegations about uncharged conduct in public filings and done so using inflammatory and prejudicial rhetoric.���

In a statement, a spokesperson for Joffe said, ���Contrary to the allegations in [the special counsel���s] recent filing, Mr. Joffe is an apolitical internet security expert with decades of service to the U.S. Government who has never worked for a political party, and who legally provided access to DNS data obtained from a private client that separately was providing DNS services to the Executive Office of the President (EOP).���

Joffe���s spokesperson said that under the terms of his contract, ���the data could be accessed to identify and analyze any security breaches or threats.���

���As a result of the hacks of EOP and [Democratic National Committee] servers in 2015 and 2016, respectively, there were serious and legitimate national security concerns about Russian attempts to infiltrate the 2016 election,��� the spokesperson said. ���Upon identifying DNS queries from Russian-made Yota phones in proximity to the Trump campaign and the EOP, respected cyber-security researchers were deeply concerned about the anomalies they found in the data and prepared a report of their findings, which was subsequently shared with the CIA.���

A spokesperson for special counsel Durham���s office said the office declines to comment beyond the court filings and any response will be in future filings with the court. 

Durham���s office originally indicted Sussmann in September. As NBC News has previously reported, Sussmann���s indictment says that he was advising the Clinton campaign in 2016 about cybersecurity matters and that a partner at his firm served as general counsel for the campaign. According to prosecutors, during a Sept. 19, 2016, meeting between Sussmann and the FBI���s general counsel at the time, James Baker, Sussmann told Baker about suspicions relating to alleged secret communications between the Trump campaign and Russia. Prosecutors said Sussmann ���stated falsely��� that he was not working for any client in reporting the suspicions.

The suspicions, which involved internet traffic with Russia���s Alfa-Bank, were later determined to be unfounded.

At the time of the indictment, Sussmann���s attorneys issued a statement that said: ���Michael Sussmann was indicted today because of politics, not facts. ��� This case represents the opposite of everything the Department of Justice is supposed to stand for.

���At its core, the Special Counsel is bringing a false statement charge based on an oral statement allegedly made five years ago to a single witness that is unrecorded and unobserved by anyone else. The Department of Justice would ordinarily never bring such a baseless case.���

Durham���s investigation continues and has resulted in one other indictment besides Sussmann���s. Last year, he charged a Russian analyst who was a source for the Steele dossier with lying to the FBI. 

Durham was also acting U.S. attorney for Connecticut during the Clinton administration and acting U.S. attorney and then U.S. attorney during the Trump administration, leaving office last year.

Friday���s court filing was made as part of an inquiry about whether the law firm Latham & Watkins had a conflict of interest in serving as counsel to Sussmann because it also represented other parties with interests in the case.

0,"Taiwan watching Ukraine crisis with 'concern and anxiety,' says top diplomat in U.S.","WASHINGTON ��� Taiwan is watching events in Ukraine with ""much concern and anxiety"" but plans to make any possible Chinese military attack on Taiwan ""too painful"" to consider, Taipei���s representative in Washington, Bi-khim Hsiao, told NBC News in an interview.

Hsiao made the comments as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned during a trip to Asia over the weekend that other countries were monitoring the Ukraine crisis closely and that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could have repercussions for the Pacific region.

Hsiao, who arrived in Washington in 2020 to lead Taiwan���s diplomatic mission in the U.S., said her government hoped the crisis over Ukraine could be settled through diplomacy.

""Like everyone else in the world, we are watching the situation with much concern and anxiety,"" she said. ""We certainly hope that the situation can be resolved peacefully through diplomatic means. But at the same time, Taiwan has distinct historical and geopolitical circumstances, and we need to be focused on our priority and that is bolstering Taiwan's self defense.""

For more, watch Hallie Jackson Now on NBC News Now at 5 p.m. ET today.

Taiwan���s president, Tsai Ing-wen, said last month her nation ""empathized"" with the plight of Ukrainians due to the military threat Taiwan faces from its powerful, larger neighbor. She ordered the creation of a task force to study how tensions between Russia and Ukraine could affect Taiwan���s own long-running conflict with Beijing.

Former U.S. officials say China will gauge the U.S. response to Russia as a possible guide to how Washington might counter a crisis over Taiwan.


Russia receives strong support from China in Ukraine standoff
FEB. 4, 202201:17
Asked about a recent joint declaration from Moscow and Beijing in which Chinese President Xi Jinping expressed support for Russia���s stance on Ukraine, Hsiao said the two countries were cooperating in ways that posed a challenge to democracies.

""I think it's pretty clear to all of us around the world that those undermining stability are China and Russia,"" she said.

Russia���s troop buildup around Ukraine began last year, but Taiwanese and U.S. officials say China has been engaged in threatening behavior towards Taipei for years, including deploying missiles near the island and repeatedly flying into the island���s air defense zone.

Hsiao, who was raised in Taiwan and educated at Oberlin College in Ohio and Columbia University in New York, said Taiwan has made clear it wants the dispute with Beijing resolved peacefully and has focused on strengthening its defenses to send a signal to Beijing that it would pay a price for any aggression.

""The Chinese must not miscalculate our resolve to defend Taiwan's democracy and the peace and stability of the region,"" Hsiao said, adding, ""Our goal, everything that we are doing, is to bolster our self defenses in a way that would make any consideration or operationalization of the threat too painful to consider.""

Beijing considers Taiwan an integral part of China that must be brought back under Chinese rule, by force if necessary. The U.S. recognized Beijing as the sole government of China in 1979 but refused to support the Chinese regime���s claims of sovereignty over Taiwan. Washington has also committed to providing for the defense of Taipei, without ever precisely spelling out what that entails.


China has accused the U.S. of fueling tensions in the Pacific with naval patrols, trying to block Beijing���s rise as a world power and provoking conflict by selling fighter jets and other weaponry to Taiwan.

""Taiwan is an inalienable part of China���s territory. These facts are grounded in history and law, and represent a universally agreed norm governing international relations,"" said Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for China���s embassy in Washington. ""China���s reunification is an unstoppable historical trend that will not be changed by anyone, any force or any country.""

Flights and other activity by the People���s Liberation Army near Taiwan were designed to protect the principle of ""one-China"" and to promote peace in the Taiwan Strait, Pengyu said in an email to NBC News.

""Over the past year,"" he said, ""the PLA has conducted regular patrols and combat drills in the waters and airspace around the Taiwan island. The objectives of these actions are very clear: to take decisive countermeasures against the egregious actions of forces within and outside the island to collude and challenge the one-China principle; to resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity; and to concretely safeguard the common welfare of compatriots on both sides of the Strait and maintain peace and stability in the Strait.""

Hsiao said China has tried to wear down Taipei through pressure tactics, bullying and disinformation that stops short of outright military action, in what her government calls ""gray zone warfare.""

Last year, the then-head of the U.S. military���s Indo-Pacific Command, Adm. Phil Davidson, warned lawmakers that China���s goal was to take control of Taiwan and that it could stage an invasion within ""the next six years.""

Hsiao said Taiwan and the U.S. were engaged in ""intense cooperation and engagement to bolster Taiwan's self defenses"" with the aim of persuading Beijing not to launch a military attack.

""We are not in a position to engage in an arms race with China. What we are doing is to fortify our defenses in a smart and strategic way so that we have the capacity to deter a military threat,"" she said.

Governments that have refused to sever ties with Taiwan or that have criticized Beijing have faced economic retaliation from China, including Lithuania and Australia, she said. Democratic countries need to rally, she said, and show China that Beijing���s ""coercion"" will not succeed.

""Bullies bully because they think they can get away with it,"" she said. ""And I think it's all the more important now that democracies work together to look into the toolbox we have in terms of countering economic coercion.""

China���s crushing of democracy in Hong Kong had ""destroyed any credibility"" that Beijing would be willing to grant more democratic rights or autonomy to some regions, under the ""One Country, Two Systems"" formula, she said.

Hsiao said Taiwan faced a difficult choice when it came to sending its athletes to the Olympic Games hosted by China.

Taiwan had to balance its concerns with China���s human rights record with Taipei���s efforts to be recognized on the world stage after being excluded or sidelined by Beijing, she said. ""It was a very complicated situation for us,"" she said.

The government of Taiwan decided to send athletes while joining a diplomatic boycott along with the United States, Australia and other governments.

Hsiao has pushed back against China���s assertive public messaging with a bit of humor. While China���s blunt-speaking envoys are known for their ""wolf warrior diplomacy,"" Hsiao refers to herself as the ""cat warrior.""

Taiwan has a lot in common with felines, she said.

""I believe cats are certainly much more lovable than wolves. Cats are nimble, flexible, cats can survive in small spaces, which exemplifies Taiwan's current international situation,"" she said.

""But also, cats have the characteristic that we cannot be coerced. And cats have nine lives and we're surviving in a very precarious, volatile situation where we're often walking on tightropes, and achieving that balance for our own survival.""",TRUE,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/taiwan-watching-ukraine-crisis-concern-anxiety-says-diplomat-n1289101,Politics,NBC
