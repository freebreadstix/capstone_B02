This one is pretty straightforward. I'm citing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: _LINKS_ 5:40 p.m. June 8, 2017 Sure: first, global temperatures are more relevant to the total impacts we will face than state or even continental numbers. For example, focusing on the Texas-only data actually obscures rather than illuminates if you are trying to help Texans gauge the risk. Two of the big dangers to us are sea level rise and Gulf hurricanes. Those risks are going to be driven by polar region warming (ice melt) and ocean surface temperatures (thermal expansion of ocean water and hurricane-fueling hot ocean surfaces) vs. average land temps in Texas. Flooding in Central Texas would also be affected by ocean temps and the regional weather dynamics they set up. In short: the fact that we may not set a record in a given year here in Texas won't protect us from the impacts of a record-setting year globally, so the global temps should get our attention.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2017/jun/15/derrick-crowe/democrat-lamar-smith-three-years-hottest-record-ea/,Science,Polifact
9372,U.S. to Cede Its Oversight of Addresses on Internet,"WASHINGTON  The United States will give up its role overseeing the system of Web addresses and domain names that form the basic plumbing of the Internet, turning it over in 2015 to an international group whose structure and administration will be determined over the next year, government officials said on Friday. Since the dawn of the Internet, the United States has been responsible for assigning the numbers that form Internet addresses, the .com, .gov and .org labels that correspond to those numbers, and for the vast database that links the two and makes sure Internet traffic goes to the right place. The function has been subcontracted since 1998 to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann, an international nonprofit organization, with the expectation that the United States would eventually step back from its role. But that transition has taken on a new urgency in the last year because of revelations that the United States intelligence community, particularly the National Security Agency, has been intercepting Internet traffic as part of its global spying efforts.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2016/sep/14/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-incorrect-about-obama-giving-control-inte/,Science,Polifact
10946,Statement by FBI Director James B. Comey on the Investigation of Secretary Hillary Clintons Use of a Personal E-Mail System,"Remarks prepared for delivery at press briefing. Good morning. Im here to give you an update on the FBIs investigation of Secretary Clintons use of a personal e-mail system during her time as Secretary of State. After a tremendous amount of work over the last year, the FBI is completing its investigation and referring the case to the Department of Justice for a prosecutive decision. What I would like to do today is tell you three things: what we did; what we found; and what we are recommending to the Department of Justice. This will be an unusual statement in at least a couple ways. First, I am going to include more detail about our process than I ordinarily would, because I think the American people deserve those details in a case of intense public interest. Second, I have not coordinated or reviewed this statement in any way with the Department of Justice or any other part of the government. They do not know what I am about to say. I want to start by thanking the FBI employees who did remarkable work in this case. Once you have a better sense of how much we have done, you will understand why I am so grateful and proud of their efforts. So, first, what we have done: The investigation began as a referral from the Intelligence Community Inspector General in connection with Secretary Clintons use of a personal e-mail server during her time as Secretary of State. The referral focused on whether classified information was transmitted on that personal system. Our investigation looked at whether there is evidence classified information was improperly stored or transmitted on that personal system, in violation of a federal statute making it a felony to mishandle classified information either intentionally or in a grossly negligent way, or a second statute making it a misdemeanor to knowingly remove classified information from appropriate systems or storage facilities. Consistent with our counterintelligence responsibilities, we have also investigated to determine whether there is evidence of computer intrusion in connection with the personal e-mail server by any foreign power, or other hostile actors. I have so far used the singular term, e-mail server, in describing the referral that began our investigation. It turns out to have been more complicated than that. Secretary Clinton used several different servers and administrators of those servers during her four years at the State Department, and used numerous mobile devices to view and send e-mail on that personal domain. As new servers and equipment were employed, older servers were taken out of service, stored, and decommissioned in various ways. Piecing all of that back togetherto gain as full an understanding as possible of the ways in which personal e-mail was used for government workhas been a painstaking undertaking, requiring thousands of hours of effort. For example, when one of Secretary Clintons original personal servers was decommissioned in 2013, the e-mail software was removed. Doing that didnt remove the e-mail content, but it was like removing the frame from a huge finished jigsaw puzzle and dumping the pieces on the floor. The effect was that millions of e-mail fragments end up unsorted in the servers unusedor slackspace. We searched through all of it to see what was there, and what parts of the puzzle could be put back together. FBI investigators have also read all of the approximately 30,000 e-mails provided by Secretary Clinton to the State Department in December 2014. Where an e-mail was assessed as possibly containing classified information, the FBI referred the e-mail to any U.S. government agency that was a likely owner of information in the e-mail, so that agency could make a determination as to whether the e-mail contained classified information at the time it was sent or received, or whether there was reason to classify the e-mail now, even if its content was not classified at the time it was sent (that is the process sometimes referred to as up-classifying). From the group of 30,000 e-mails returned to the State Department, 110 e-mails in 52 e-mail chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received. Eight of those chains contained information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent; 36 chains contained Secret information at the time; and eight contained Confidential information, which is the lowest level of classification. Separate from those, about 2,000 additional e-mails were up-classified to make them Confidential; the information in those had not been classified at the time the e-mails were sent. The FBI also discovered several thousand work-related e-mails that were not in the group of 30,000 that were returned by Secretary Clinton to State in 2014. We found those additional e-mails in a variety of ways. Some had been deleted over the years and we found traces of them on devices that supported or were connected to the private e-mail domain. Others we found by reviewing the archived government e-mail accounts of people who had been government employees at the same time as Secretary Clinton, including high-ranking officials at other agencies, people with whom a Secretary of State might naturally correspond. This helped us recover work-related e-mails that were not among the 30,000 produced to State. Still others we recovered from the laborious review of the millions of e-mail fragments dumped into the slack space of the server decommissioned in 2013. With respect to the thousands of e-mails we found that were not among those produced to State, agencies have concluded that three of those were classified at the time they were sent or received, one at the Secret level and two at the Confidential level. There were no additional Top Secret e-mails found. Finally, none of those we found have since been up-classified. I should add here that we found no evidence that any of the additional work-related e-mails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them. Our assessment is that, like many e-mail users, Secretary Clinton periodically deleted e-mails or e-mails were purged from the system when devices were changed. Because she was not using a government accountor even a commercial account like Gmailthere was no archiving at all of her e-mails, so it is not surprising that we discovered e-mails that were not on Secretary Clintons system in 2014, when she produced the 30,000 e-mails to the State Department. It could also be that some of the additional work-related e-mails we recovered were among those deleted as personal by Secretary Clintons lawyers when they reviewed and sorted her e-mails for production in 2014. The lawyers doing the sorting for Secretary Clinton in 2014 did not individually read the content of all of her e-mails, as we did for those available to us; instead, they relied on header information and used search terms to try to find all work-related e-mails among the reportedly more than 60,000 total e-mails remaining on Secretary Clintons personal system in 2014. It is highly likely their search terms missed some work-related e-mails, and that we later found them, for example, in the mailboxes of other officials or in the slack space of a server. It is also likely that there are other work-related e-mails that they did not produce to State and that we did not find elsewhere, and that are now gone because they deleted all e-mails they did not return to State, and the lawyers cleaned their devices in such a way as to preclude complete forensic recovery. We have conducted interviews and done technical examination to attempt to understand how that sorting was done by her attorneys. Although we do not have complete visibility because we are not able to fully reconstruct the electronic record of that sorting, we believe our investigation has been sufficient to give us reasonable confidence there was no intentional misconduct in connection with that sorting effort. And, of course, in addition to our technical work, we interviewed many people, from those involved in setting up and maintaining the various iterations of Secretary Clintons personal server, to staff members with whom she corresponded on e-mail, to those involved in the e-mail production to State, and finally, Secretary Clinton herself. Last, we have done extensive work to understand what indications there might be of compromise by hostile actors in connection with the personal e-mail operation. Thats what we have done. Now let me tell you what we found: Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information. For example, seven e-mail chains concern matters that were classified at the Top Secret/Special Access Program level when they were sent and received. These chains involved Secretary Clinton both sending e-mails about those matters and receiving e-mails from others about the same matters. There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clintons position, or in the position of those government employees with whom she was corresponding about these matters, should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation. In addition to this highly sensitive information, we also found information that was properly classified as Secret by the U.S. Intelligence Community at the time it was discussed on e-mail (that is, excluding the later up-classified e-mails). None of these e-mails should have been on any kind of unclassified system, but their presence is especially concerning because all of these e-mails were housed on unclassified personal servers not even supported by full-time security staff, like those found at Departments and Agencies of the U.S. Governmentor even with a commercial service like Gmail. Separately, it is important to say something about the marking of classified information. Only a very small number of the e-mails containing classified information bore markings indicating the presence of classified information. But even if information is not marked classified in an e-mail, participants who know or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it. While not the focus of our investigation, we also developed evidence that the security culture of the State Department in general, and with respect to use of unclassified e-mail systems in particular, was generally lacking in the kind of care for classified information found elsewhere in the government. With respect to potential computer intrusion by hostile actors, we did not find direct evidence that Secretary Clintons personal e-mail domain, in its various configurations since 2009, was successfully hacked. But, given the nature of the system and of the actors potentially involved, we assess that we would be unlikely to see such direct evidence. We do assess that hostile actors gained access to the private commercial e-mail accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact from her personal account. We also assess that Secretary Clintons use of a personal e-mail domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent. She also used her personal e-mail extensively while outside the United States, including sending and receiving work-related e-mails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. Given that combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clintons personal e-mail account. So thats what we found. Finally, with respect to our recommendation to the Department of Justice: In our system, the prosecutors make the decisions about whether charges are appropriate based on evidence the FBI has helped collect. Although we dont normally make public our recommendations to the prosecutors, we frequently make recommendations and engage in productive conversations with prosecutors about what resolution may be appropriate, given the evidence. In this case, given the importance of the matter, I think unusual transparency is in order. Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case. Prosecutors necessarily weigh a number of factors before bringing charges. There are obvious considerations, like the strength of the evidence, especially regarding intent. Responsible decisions also consider the context of a persons actions, and how similar situations have been handled in the past. In looking back at our investigations into mishandling or removal of classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts. All the cases prosecuted involved some combination of: clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information; or vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional misconduct; or indications of disloyalty to the United States; or efforts to obstruct justice. We do not see those things here. To be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances, a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences. To the contrary, those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions. But that is not what we are deciding now. As a result, although the Department of Justice makes final decisions on matters like this, we are expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case. I know there will be intense public debate in the wake of this recommendation, as there was throughout this investigation. What I can assure the American people is that this investigation was done competently, honestly, and independently. No outside influence of any kind was brought to bear. I know there were many opinions expressed by people who were not part of the investigationincluding people in governmentbut none of that mattered to us. Opinions are irrelevant, and they were all uninformed by insight into our investigation, because we did the investigation the right way. Only facts matter, and the FBI found them here in an entirely apolitical and professional way. I couldnt be prouder to be part of this organization.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/06/hillary-clinton/fbi-findings-tear-holes-hillary-clintons-email-def/,Science,Polifact
11543,The Politics of the Gorilla Story,"RUSH: Were gonna get to the gorilla business. Thats easily explained, too. Folks, you remember when the two fish, what kind of fish were they, I keep thinking dolphins or porpoises, way back in the nineties, a couple of them got caught in sea ice, way far north of where they should have been, and the whole country became captivated with, will they find their way out? What can we do? Can we cut holes in the ice so that the porpoise, the dolphins, whatever they were, can we guide them out? Can we do something? Can we save them? Everybody became captivated. Same thing here, the same principles are involved, except now there was politics in this Cincinnati Zoo thing because theres politics in everything. Cant take it out. Cant escape it. Cant avoid it. And Im gonna explain that also as the program unfolds. To show you how silly it got. For a time Black Lives Matter even got upset about this because they originally thought the parents and the boy were white. Then when they found out that the parents and boy were black, then all hell broke loose and they had to back off and take a different tack on this. (interruption) What are you laughing at? Thats exactly what happened. You denying that? You didnt know that? You didnt know Black Lives Matter got involved? (laughing) It was Black Lives Matter versus gorilla lives matter versus do any life matter, human life versus animal life, what matters most. Easily explainable in our really screwed-up culture and society today. I can make it understandable from top to bottom, which I will do, BREAK TRANSCRIPT RUSH: To Harambe, the gorilla at the Cincinnati Zoo. A 400 pound wild animal born in captivity, but gorillas are not domesticated, contrary to what the feminists think. Dont most feminists that are married think theyre married to gorillas anyway? Its like dragons, folks. You cant tame em. Youve seen Game of Thrones. You cant tame a dragon. These are not pets. But we name them. This ones name was Harambe. And I assume we think that he knew his name. And we assume that he probably liked his name. So a four-year-old child happens to plunge into the gorilla pen at the Cincinnati Zoo before anybody notices it. And in order to save his life, the zoo people made the decision to kill the gorilla. Now, I am totally aware of why so many people think that the zoo made the wrong decision. I totally understand American pop culture today. I understand our society. I understand where it is. I understand that, in our culture today, that gorilla, compared to any human being, is the essence of innocence, even a four-year-old child. In fact, many on the left, dont doubt me on this, youre gonna think this is funny or crazy, but Im dead serious. Many on the left compare that gorilla in the zoo with unfair imprisonment of human beings. That zoo is the equivalent of a prison, and of course those kinds of people think that we have too many people in jail in this country. That they are in jail because theyve been railroaded, not because theyve committed any crimes. Thats the first thing. It may not be something that they consciously voice, but it is in their subconscious the way they look at this. Im talking particularly about leftists. The whole zoo thing is unfair. The whole zoo thing is an example of human bigotry, racism, whatever else, mean-spiritedness, extremism, humans are the cause of global warming. Humans are the cause of climate change. Humans are the cause of animal suffering. Humans are the cause of everything going wrong on earth. By definition, these people cannot be familiar with Genesis, and if they were, they would dissociate themselves from it. They have absolutely no such training, foundation, or awareness of the primacy of humanity on planet Earth as created by God. Such a mind-set does not exist with them. Its the exact opposite. Humanity is the problem. Humanity is not the solution. So a young child falls in. There are stages of video that are produced by people that were there, and the first video is always the one that makes the impression, Looky, that gorilla was trying to save that boy. He was trying to pull his pants up, even, so he wasnt ashamed, nude, in that moat. This gorilla was trying to protect that boy. That gorilla, he was a new playmate. Dont forget, Americas most prominent exposure to gorillas is with Koko. Koko is a female gorilla who picks NFL games every Friday. Koko uses sign language. Koko has become a human. We humanize all animals, particularly those that we can go watch, maybe even pet, get close to. And we attend to associate  some of us do, some people transfer their own traits to animals and think that theres no difference other than maybe intelligence or what have you. But as I looked at it, it took me one thing to see. That gorilla is 400 pounds, and when that gorilla scooped that kid up and ran at breakneck speed through that moat, dragging the kid behind him, the gorilla doesnt know from protecting the little guy boys head from banging against the wall. The gorilla doesnt know from drowning. The gorilla doesnt know from anything. But most people dont want to assume that. They want to assign protector status to the gorilla, as youll hear in an audio sound bite. The thing is, nobody was gonna get that boy out of that gorillas hands. Nobody was gonna be able to walk, no, there and say, Hey, Harambe, hey, bud, hey, you know, we need to take that little toy that you just got, we need to take it away from you. Right. It was not going to happen. Harambe was not gonna deliver the boy somewhere to a zoo keeper to take it back to its mother. I know he was holding the boys hand. Sat him up. I know. I know how the pictures look. He was his friend, he was protecting him, was a new buddy down there, understand all that. Harambe wasnt gonna hurt him. Harambe was loving and caring and so forth, probably a better parent than many humans are. Probably treating that boy better than maybe his own family does. You just never know. You just never know, right? That gorilla could have been teaching us all a lesson on how to deal with kids. I mean, folks, look at social media, youll find all kinds of explanations. Social media has just become such a sewer that even Fakebook, Google, and all the others are promising to clean it up every 24 hours, hate speech gone in 24 hours. You want to bet? Certain hate speech is gonna be applauded, its gonna be strategically placed, that against conservatives. Media lies about conservatives/Republicans will still be featured prominently in trending, you name it. But, anyway, I just dont think there was any way that boy was gonna get out of there alive short of what happened. And I think the people that are being forgotten in all this are the zoo people that had to do it. I think in all the agony thats out there today, the people that run that zoo that had to do this are probably feeling the worst of anybody, cause that gorilla was part of their lives. The gorilla had a handler, somebody fed the gorilla. The gorillas born in captivity, so the gorilla had a lot of contact with people at this zoo, and to have to take the gorilla out to save the boy, theyre gonna be distressed over this for a long, long time, the people that run that zoo and had to make the decision, whatever, to pull the trigger. But it comes down to, what do you value here? Should the boy lose his life because the mother was irresponsible, let him plunge in the first place? Should the gorillas life take primacy? It was the gorillas home. The gorilla wasnt doing anything to anybody. The gorilla was minding its own business, all of a sudden this four-year-old kid falls in there, its the gorillas fault? We gotta kill the gorilla? Depends on how you value human life versus all other life on the planet. And even, you know, folks, so sad, it even had a racial component. Originally when it was not known what race the child and the parents were, you should have seen some of the comments then. And then it was Black Lives Matter getting involved in all this. And then they found out, no, wait, cant go there, had to back off and go elsewhere. The way people on the left look at things is just continually itself insufferable and insulting. I mentioned earlier the two, I think they were dolphins or porpoises, that somehow strayed way north of their natural  (interruption) was it New Jersey? No, no. There was ice  no, no. No, no, no. I mean way north. Were talking Canada here. They were mammals. They had to surface to be able to breathe. And we were cutting holes in the ice for them to do so, and we were trying to cut holes in the ice in a way that would steer them to safety, if they follow the holes. I remember back then, this is in the nineties sometime, I remember taking calls from people on, Why are we wasting all this money? Its a couple of fish, for crying out loud, they got lost, big deal. And I recall the incident, the same thing had happened to a blue whale or something, happened Sacramento Delta. The thing had gotten screwed up and it swam up from the San Francisco Bay all the way up the Sacramento Delta area and was running out of saltwater and they were all worried about what to do with it. They were trying to figure out a way to turn it around and go back to where it should be. I remember defending the fish. I remember on this program telling people, Look, you have to understand why so many people are concerned about this. Theyve done nothing wrong. They maybe got lost, went a different way, but these animals, compared to all else going on, theyre innocent. Theyre struggling on their own. Theyre trying to live. Its not like theyre a bunch of welfare recipients taking the day off out there. They are doing everything they can to survive. So us helping them makes all the sense in the world to me. But, Im telling you, folks, 20 years ago when that happened, the vast majority of sentiment was not for those dolphin or porpoises, whatever they were. It was people asking, Why are we spending so much money? Military helicopters, we were spending a lot of money breaking the ice, drilling holes, trying to get em out of there. And people thought it was a waste of money. Hey, it happens, its nature. They went the wrong place, pay the consequences. No, no, I said, people have to understand, theyre the essence of innocence, theyre trying to save themselves, and were trying to help them do that. This situation, here you have a gorilla minding its own business in its own home not bothering anybody. It had never bothered anybody. And then some mother looks the other way for a while and her kid plunges into the gorilla pen, and while the gorilla is holding her baby and dragging the baby along and so forth, the mother, Mommys here! Mommys here! And people say, Mommys where? Why isnt Mommy down there trying to get the kid back? Most mommies would be doing what they can instead of shouting Mommys here! Mommys here!' Nobody was gonna get the kid back. And youve heard they didnt want to use tranquilizer. That would have just made the gorilla mad. It would have taken a long time to go into effect, to take effect, and who knows what the gorilla would have done had he gotten mad. So its an unfortunate circumstance, but they didnt have any other choice. If they wanted to save that child, that was the only way they were gonna do it. I know a lot of people want to believe that whoever Harambes friends were on the zoo staff could have walked in there, you know, with a plate of food or what have you, or just with good vibes, Hey, Harambe, how are you? You know that thing you have, thats not supposed to be here. Hand him over, whatever they were gonna do to get the gorilla to hand over his toy. Go to the audio sound bites. Not much here, but I want to illustrate. We have, who is this, where is this? What did I do with it? Oh, here it is, number 15, Ashley Byrne. This was yesterday on CNNs Newsroom in the morning, Carol Costello, this is PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, senior campaigner Ashley Byrne. Question: Do you agree that zoo officials had to kill the gorilla because they say they couldnt take a chance the gorilla would react badly if they shot him with a tranquilizer dart? BYRNE: In many circumstances gorillas have shown that they can be protective of children or small beings. Frankly, the fact that this gorilla was innocent in the first place, thats the first place that this situation went wrong because even under the best circumstances captivity is never adequate for gorillas and other primates. And in cases like this we see that its even deadly. And this tragedy is exactly why PETA urges families to stay away from any facility, zoos, circuses, or otherwise, that displays animals as a sideshow for humans to gawk at. RUSH: Animals (sigh) This woman obviously has not read Genesis and even if she did, it wouldnt have any impact on her. But human beings travel all over the world to gawk at animals precisely because theyre unusual! Theyre interesting. Some are cute, some are deadly, some Theres no way human beings are gonna not be interested in animals. Gawking at them out on safari, hunting them or what have you. By the way, you know theres another factor in this, Snerdley? A lot of people think that all of us used to be apes. Dont doubt me on this. A lot of people think that all of us used to be gorillas, and theyre looking for the missing link out there. The evolution crowd. They think we were originally apes. Ive always had a question: If we were the original apes, then how come Harambe is still an ape, and how come he didnt become one of us? Well, thats why theyre all missing link, Mr. Limbaugh. Your question is absurd. Heres one more from Ashley Byrne from PETA. You know, the gorillas endangered, he was 17 years old. Theyve had him for quite a long time. BYRNE: He was 17 years old and r-reports say that he had a young baby of his own  who, of course, is now without a father. So, y-you know, again (snickers), I think this shows us the tragic side of keeping animals in zoos for our entertainment. But it can go horribly wrong, and that the zoo failed Harambe by taking the risk that something like this would happen. RUSH: So Harambes child is now without a father, one of the many unfortunate aspects of this. So another busted gorilla home at the Cincinnati Zoo. And you know what happens. BREAK TRANSCRIPT RUSH: If something had happened to that four-year-old boy in the gorilla pen, you know what the catcalls would be. Why didnt you shoot the gorilla? Why did you wait? So the zoo people, theyre not gonna win no matter what. But my guess is they feel worse than anybody about this, the people that had to do it. BREAK TRANSCRIPT RUSH: I want to take at least one more call right now, maybe two. We go to Chicago. This is Dannette. Im glad you called. Hi. CALLER: I love you, I love you, I love you, but I have to say: You really make me angry when you start making fun of animal lovers. RUSH: I dont make fun of animal lovers. CALLER: Okay, just now when you were talking about that gal from PETA, you were making fun of what she was saying. RUSH: Shes a liberal! She is not an animal lover. Shes a leftist who is interested in the advancement of the liberal agenda by her  CALLER: Okay, but  RUSH:  attitude toward humanity and its insignificance and its cruelty and so forth. Believe me, PETA is a left-wing, liberal organization using animal rights  just like feminism is a bunch of liberals using womens issues  to advance the leftist agenda. CALLER: Okay, but Rush, I am not a liberal by any means. Im a big Trump fan, and Im a big animal lover. Ive got my own pet  RUSH: So am I! Im the biggest animal lover you ever met. CALLER: Okay, but Okay, this gorilla got killed because of why? Human error. No matter how you look at it, human error. I dont humanize animals. Um, but you know what? Someones gotta stick up for them, and someone does have to give them rights. RUSH: I just did. I just did. I pointed out the gorilla was bothering nobody, the gorilla was doing what gorillas do. It was minding its own business, it was in its home, and all of a sudden, a human four-year-old drops in there. CALLER: Absolutely. And, okay, now, whats gonna be the question? The zoo wasnt taking precautions enough. There wasnt a high enough wall. This is such bullcrap with these children going on  RUSH: Wait. Wait a minute. You may not have heard, but the Cincinnati police are looking into criminal charges against the zoo. CALLER: And on Fox News this morning they said there were not gonna be any charges, the parents were going to be cleared. You know what? Its  RUSH: No, no! No, no! Wait! Not against the parents. The zoo, precisely because the four-year-old was able to fall in there. CALLER: Okay, see, and thats what I mean. When is it gonna be the parents responsibility? I dont know what the frick the mother was doing  RUSH: Forget that. Thats never No. That isnt gonna happen. CALLER: This is why the generation of kids is ending up to be the generation of what they are. Because its never their fault, its never the parents fault  and again, I am so much for animals. I felt so bad for this gorilla. Like you said, he was just doing his own thing, and Im one of those animal-crazy people where if theres a person on the side of the road thats injured, and theres an animal on the side of the road thats injured, the person is screwed with me. Thats all there is to it, because I just think people make their own decisions and a lot of times, Rush, theyre very evil. Theyre very evil. And with this gorilla I just felt really, really  RUSH: Youre making my point. What youre doing here is understandable. Youre looking at the animal. In your example, you got an injured animal on the side of the road, we dont know how it got there, and weve got an injured human being on the side of the road. Your automatic, your default position is to go check out the animal. You know why? Because its the essence of innocence. The human being had a choice, whether or not to get in an accident and be on the side of the road. The animal is just along for the ride and its not its fault no matter what, and it cant take care of itself so youve gotta go help it. CALLER: Absolutely. RUSH: All right. CALLER: And I feel very strong about that. So if people want to call me crazy, so be it. But I feel I hold no bones about that. All my clients even know who I am and how I am with animals. RUSH: Nobodys calling you crazy! CALLER: Well  RUSH: Its just that in the  CALLER: Im sure, youre gonna get phone calls on this. You know this. RUSH: Well, maybe. I can handle that. Phone calls. CALLER: But, you know what? I love you. I told Mr. Snerdley, I love you to death; so I really, really do. RUSH: Well, you can rest assured that theres no bigger animal lover than me. I have three dogs and Ive got this little cat. CALLER: (giggles) RUSH: But even aside from that, the reason I know how you feel about animals is I feel the same way about them. But when it comes down in the gorilla case, situation, its just one of these unfortunate things. There was no way that anybody was gonna get that gorilla to hand over the baby. I guess you, in that circumstance, value the gorillas life more than the babys because the parents are the ultimate responsibility. CALLER: Thats right. RUSH: The kid wouldnt have fallen in there if the parents had been paying attention, so the parents need to pay the price; the gorilla doesnt. Thats your view. CALLER: Well, this is how I feel. You heard the mother on the tape, Mommys here! Mommys here! Where the good frick was Mommy two minutes ago before the kid fell in? RUSH: Right. CALLER: Where was Mommy? RUSH: Mommy was with the cotton candy vendor. I dont know what she was doing. CALLER: And, you know And again, thats just my view. I love you, Rush, but you know, animals are my world, and sometimes I just feel youre condescending to animal lovers. So RUSH: I am not condescending to animal lovers. I am condescending to PETA. I am condescending to people who use peoples natural love for animals as a way to advance the liberal agenda. Look, if you want to understand me, if youre ever confused with what I say, what I mean, understand: Its always my belief that theres politics in everything, and I am opposed to liberalism. And I am opposed to the seductive ways that liberalism corrupts people  innocent people  into assuming positions that are detrimental to American society and the culture and the country the large. And the left has got all these disparate groups. Theyve got animal rights groups, they got PETA, they got environmentalist wackos, theyve got feminists. This is how they do it. Every one of these groups ends up You notice whos to blame for all this? Its always humanity, usually conservative human beings or Republican human beings. Its human beings destroying the planet when I dont think we have the ability to. We dont have the ability to destroy the environment. If a president ordered the worlds most intelligent scientists to destroy the ozone, they couldnt do it. If a president or the pope ordered the smartest scientists in the world to destroy the climate of the earth, they could not do it. They wouldnt know where to begin. And yet were told every day that were doing it and were the cause. By what? Advancing and progress in our lives. And its BS. It is utter, total BS, and its one of the many webs of deceit that has been woven into the fabric of our society by the American and international left to advance their agenda of big government control over all people. Because people dont know whats best, people dont know whats important, people dont know whats important, or other things: People are selfish, people are this, people are that. And I resent the heck out of it. I do not make fun of animal lovers. I understand them. I try to protect them from getting lassoed into some liberal agenda that they dont understand and end up promoting and advancing while theyre not even aware that theyre doing it. And its just It gets absurd sometimes. But I have a reverence for animals. I dont spend a lot of time talking about it here because it just never comes up. But I do not make fun of animal lovers. I am one. I make fun of and I try to expose liberalism everywhere it is lurking. And it lurks. Its always behind the scenes and underneath the surface. Its never, ever out in the open. It couldnt survive if it were. So never forget that. Next time you hear me ripping into or making fun of what you think is an animal lover, stop and think for a moment: What is Rush really saying here? and take it beyond what you think it is. Understand that theres always going to be a political component because politics is part of everything. Whether people like it or not, want to admit it or not, thats the truth. BREAK TRANSCRIPT RUSH: Police originally said there werent gonna be any charges. Authorities are now taking a second look at the possibility of criminal charges in the incident after the police initially said that no one would be charged. And what theyre looking at, apparently the incident at the Cincinnati Zoo involved the young child who fell into the gorilla enclosure, the incident under investigation by the Cincinnati Police Department. Once the investigations concluded, theyll confer with the DAs office, the prosecutors office on possible criminal charges. This will be against the zoo I dont think for killing the gorilla. I think its gonna be about the enclosure and whether or not it was sufficient to prevent something like this from happening. Now, witnesses said that the child had expressed a desire to get into the enclosure and climbed over a three-foot barrier and then fell 15 feet into a moat. His mother on Facebook said he suffered a concussion and scrapes but was otherwise fine. I will guarantee you that all of this commentary, if you will, on social media is driving the cops to change their mind on perhaps pursuing a criminal investigation here. But you go talk to any lawyer you want, and the lawyer will tell you that charges against the parents in something like this will never happen. Theyll never be able to prove criminal child endangerment or anything of the sort. They wont even go there. That if there are charges, itll be against the zoo, and itll be in relationship to the enclosure where people are standing, observing the gorillas. BREAK TRANSCRIPT RUSH: Mark in Ridgefield Park, New Jersey. Great to have you with us. Youre next. Hello. CALLER: Hello, Rush. Pleasure talking with you, sir. RUSH: Thank you, sir, very much. CALLER: Regarding the gorilla shooting. Sometimes I feel like Im living in the Twilight Zone. Are we actually having a discussion between choosing the life of a gorilla over a boy? I mean, this is outrageous. Im thinking about it. RUSH: I cannot hear a word youre saying. Im having to read what youre saying. So you find it outrageous that people even think theres a question over whether to shoot the gorilla or not and save the boy? CALLER: Correct. To get to my bigger point, I mean, in America, we slaughter cows and pigs by the truckload on a daily basis. Theres no outrage about that. I mean, Im just trying to make sort of a funny point over this. Maybe the media is the one  RUSH: Yes. But, look, when you run over a possum, when you run over any other road kill animal or when we go to the slaughterhouse to slaughter a bunch of steers and stuff, it isnt on television, and there arent little children in the area that are being held by the hand of the animal about to be slaughtered. And those animals have not had movies made about them, nor are there storybooks about them. I mean, whens the last slaughterhouse comic book you read? CALLER: Yeah, youre right about that. RUSH: I mean, once the effort has been made to humanize pets, animals, it is thought that all animals could end up being pets if we just had the right circumstances. But this is  you know, the fact that its on TV and the fact that the first  never forget, the first video did not appear to show the child threatened at all. Why, Harambe was holding the boy out of the water. Harambe appeared to be keeping the child dressed, his pants up, was holding his hand. Thats the first video that was released. And the person that shot the video, another person who shot some videos saw that and said, Wait a minute, thats not the whole story. Then we got another video which showed Harambe grabbing the kid by the hand and darting under the water. The kid was being dragged through that moat under the tree as we lost sight of the kid for a while. It was at breakneck speed, and people, Oh, my God, the kids gonna have a broken neck. The kids arm is gonna be ripped off. Oh, my God, hes gonna slam the kids head against the wall. But that was the second video seen, not the first. And the first video showed a polite, even fatherly Harambe protecting the child from an irresponsible human parent. Social media gets in gear and Harambe was not threatening anybody, was in his own home, he didnt cause any of this, bammo, he gets shot. Theres a lot of affection for animals out there, particularly animals that are in captivity and havent done anything to anybody. Look, if you really stop, youll be able to understand all of those emotional reactions. Where it does get interesting is your point, when you reduce the question to its bare essence, save the boy, save the gorilla, thats what youre having trouble understanding how there can be any debate. The fact that people could be saying, Well, hey, its not the gorillas fault. The parents ought to pay a price for their negligence here. Wait, youre saying that boy should  Well, its not the gorillas fault. I can give you another example. I probably shouldnt. I can give you another example. Let me think about this other. Cause theres another example that illustrates this dilemma where human life loses when the questions asked. Makes you very uncomfortable to hear it. But in this case there are people who think that gorillas life mattered more. In a country with whatever million number of abortions every year, I mean, you cant factor that out in understanding how people would have problems placing value on which life counts most here.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2016/jun/03/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-asks-why-cincinnati-zoo-gorilla-hadn/,Science,Polifact
12030,What I Said at the Vatican About the Worlds Efforts to Fight Cancer,"Your Eminence, Your Eminences. And, Elana, thank you for that very gracious introduction. Ive have an opportunity in my 200-year career, as youve just heard. His Eminence and I were talking about age. I am 25 years older than His Eminence, but Ive spoken in a number of magnificent fora, but none more magnificent than this. And its a great, great honor to be back in the Vatican. And, Elana, I want to thank you for the introduction. But more than that, I want to thank you for your courage, and your familys courage, and the inspiration you give to so many young people around the world. It matters. Your Eminences, Im honored to be with you in this magnificent hall. And, Robin, thank you. Its good to be here. Its a pleasure to be with all of you scientists, physicians, faith leaders, philanthropists, patients, and their families. There is no cancer patient whose circumstances are not shared with everyone that loves them. I know, as millions of people around the world know. And I want to stand by thanking all of you who are here for your knowledge, your dedication, your tenacity, and for your pastoral care. Like tens of millions of people around the world, my family and I have been the beneficiaries of your wisdom, your commitment, your compassion when we were still clinging to hope that  my son Hunter is with me, and my son-in-law Howard  we were clinging to hope that Hunters brother, my son would somehow be the beneficiary of a last-minute breakthrough before God called him. If you permit me what they call in my country, in my Senate where I worked, whenever you wanted to make a personal statement, the protocol was to stand on the floor of the Senate and say, Id like to ask forgiveness for a point of personal privilege. I know hes not here at the moment. But I want to thank His Holiness for the personal time and the private time, the generosity with his time. As he was leaving the United States, I had the great privilege of escorting him to the aircraft in the city of Philadelphia. And he asked if he could meet with my family. We had just lost my son. And he met with my extended family in the hangar behind where the aircraft was. And I wish every grieving parent, brother, sister, mother, father would have had the benefit of his words, his prayers, his presence. He provided us with more comfort than even he I think will ever understand. We experienced in my family what binds so many in this room together and all across the world, how faith can turn loss into hope  and hope into action. Vice President Joe Biden greets His Holiness Pope Francis after delivering remarks on cancer at the Vaticans International Conference on Regenerative Medicine. Vatican City, April 29, 2016. (Official White House photo by David Lienemann) The Holy Father has given hope to so many people of all faiths in every part of the world with his strong words and humble ways. I arrived from Iraq, from Erbil just this morning, at 5:30 in the morning. And when I told the Shia leader of Iraq in Baghdad, the Kurd and Sunni leader of Iraq in Erbil where I was going, they each wanted to talk about the Holy Father. I think thats a pretty incredible thing. It reminds us that as we stand on the cusp of unprecedented, scientific and technological change  of amazing discoveries that were once unimaginable breakthroughs, we cannot forget that real lives and real people are at the heart and the reason for all that we do. There is always a child, a son, a daughter, a husband, a wife, a loved one in pain summoning all the courage they can, sustained by hope that a cure will be there for them. And everyone else who is and may be in their shoes thinks the same way. And the truth is that today  more than any point in human history  we have a genuine opportunity to help more people across the world than ever before. And thats our obligation. And when we think about the promise measured against the need, every minute of every day matters. And I know every one of you understand that. From my perspective thats why were here. In a sense I may be the most  least qualified person to speak here today. I am not a researcher. Im not an oncologist. Im not a geneticist. Im a Vice President of the United States. But Ive been on the other end of the need. But thats what I want to talk to you about today. For hundreds of years humankind has tried to deal with and fight and cure cancer. In the United States nearly 50 years ago, President Richard M. Nixon announced for the first time in America history, a war on cancer. Since then weve spent billions of dollars. And thousands of researchers and scientists and doctors and medical centers and government agencies, philanthropists have all worked with the singular focus of trying to defeat or at least slow cancer. Weve made progress worldwide in prevention with campaigns to end smoking, increasing cancer screenings, and the emergence of vaccines, the final epiphany of understanding that our personal habits and our physical environment  cleaner air and cleaner water  probably hold a greater promise than any single thing we could do to prevent cancer. Weve made progress in treating some cancers  some better than others like lymphoma. Cancer-related death rates are down 23 percent over 20 years. But they havent declined enough. And we have to ask ourselves, why havent we made more progress? Its expected that the world will see almost 20 million new cases of cancer, and 11.4 additional million cancer deaths by 2025. So the question  among others  that brings us here today is: How can we prevent that from happening? My regret is that I was in Iraq the last couple days and not sitting here absorbing, listening to, taking in the presentations made by some of the most brilliant minds in the world who are assembled here today and over the last several days and who are finding the answer. The answer is clear that in science for the first time we are more ready, and technology is here. And our capacity to connect with each of them around the world holds greater hope than ever existed. So when I called for a Cancer Moonshot  and the President almost wished we hadnt used the word moonshot. It generates comments about the phrase moonshot. But when I walked into the Rose Garden off the White House with the President back in October to announce I wasnt running for President of the United States, I said the one regret I have I wish I could have been the President of the United States that presided over a fundamental change in the effort to cure and/or turn some cancers into chronic diseases. I knew this time is different from previous efforts. Many of the parents who are here  or families that are here  you learn to become an expert very quickly when someone you adore is in serious difficulty. Or as my mother, Jean Finnegan Biden, would say, Joey, a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing. But you try to absorb as much as you can about the disease that that person who shares your soul is fighting. And because I had access to one of the great cancer research hospitals in the world  MD Anderson  and others, I had a chance to talk to the worlds top cancer researchers, scientists, philanthropists. And I learned its really within the last four to five years that science and the medicine of cancer have reached an inflection point that is almost brand new. We hadnt been here before. Just five years ago, oncologists werent working with immunologists, virologists, geneticists, chemical, and biological engineers and so many other disciplines. I didnt realize that immunology was thought of as sort of a voodoo science 15 years ago. Im being a bit facetious. But this is the first time in history all these disciplines are now beginning to work closer and closer together and holding enormous promise. And today coalitions of cancer organizations are aggregating genomics, patients records, families history, lifestyles using super computers to find answers that we dont have right now. Date technology firms with whom Ive met, the largest in the world, are converting data into machine-readable formats, making it more accessible to researchers and discovering new patterns that could deliver real results for patients  not unlike mapping the stars. And the world is taking note of all of you assembled here in this hall and your collaboration, because its relatively new. Ive had the great privilege, because of my job, to meet with world leaders who want to work together on the process. Im told a member of the royal family of the UAE is here. When I met with Mohammed bin Zayed recently, I went to talk about how we deal with Daesh and ISIL. As youll recall, the discussion was, lets talk about cancer. How can we generate a memorandum of understanding between our countries? The same thing is going on when I go to Israel. Im meeting with President Abe, of Japan; President Park, of South Korea. The number of world leaders that have contacted me that want to collaborate and work together. They sense exactly what we sense  the enormous possibilities. Philanthropists from around the world are investing billions of their money in this fight, and you see it here. Ten years ago regenerative medicine was a dream. Today its a reality. Look at this conference. The Pontifical Council for Culture is bringing the world together to deliver breakthrough therapies and improve care for people all around the world. And Im grateful. But the point is that so much has changed, there is so much more hope, and I might add such higher expectation, the community at large. But while governments can do a great deal, this is not the work of one government, or government itself. Theres an overwhelming need for a public-private partnership to bring together all of the human and financial and knowledge resources at our disposal to make a quantum leap. Our goal in the United States is to do within the next five years what would otherwise take a decade. But thats the work of all of us. And today Im calling on  Im calling for an international commitment grounded on a few basic principles. Vice President Joe Biden delivers remarks at the Vaticans International Conference on Regenerative Medicine, Vatican City, April 29, 2016. (Official White House Photo by David Lienemann) Ive traveled the United States over the last six months visiting with over 290 oncologists, going to 10 of our greatest cancer research centers, meeting with drug companies, meeting with big data firms. Certain things have emerged, and I am not a medical expert. But I have spent my life trying to solve complicated problems and entities that do not talk to one another. The first principle I think we could adopt is to focus on prevention, access, and affordability around the world. Nearly 50 percent of all cancers are preventable. Take cervical cancer  530,000 new cases are diagnosed each year; 270,000 people die each year; 87 percent in developing countries. In Africa, its the second most common cancer after breast cancer. Its a travesty. But its fully preventable with basic education, screening, and vaccines. We have a greater global combination  to coordinate  we need greater global coordination to promote healthier lifestyles that prevent cancers like it. We need gender  we need greater coordination to reduce environmental causes of other forms of deadly but preventable cancers. We also have to increase access to treatment. Even in the United States of America, a developed country, access to care is not what it should be. Less than 5 percent of all cancer patients wind up in a clinical trial. Seventy-percent of cancer patients are treated by community oncologists  good, qualified men and women, but who dont have access to the treatment trials and expertise available to Americas great cancer institutes. And treatments have to be affordable. The best medicine and treatment cant belong only to the privileged and the powerful. It has to belong to everyone. The second principle is the international response to cancer should reflect the same urgency we bring to infectious disease threats. Cancer is the constant emergency. In the United States alone we lose more than 1,600* people a day to cancer. We should be doing everything possible to accelerate cancer treatments and cures with urgency. We should be sharing data the moment its published  immediately. Not hiding it behind pay walls that prevent information from being shared for a year or more. We just dealt with the Hubble Telescope, with a new technology that was found to how to better  have more accuracy in the pictures; stuff of which could have national security implications. It was made available to world immediately. Immediately. Why do you wait? What is your rationale? Creating faster grant and review cycles so the best minds in the world can work on the hardest problems in cancer as soon as possible. We should build up the capacity of the civil societies to fill gaps of care, and screening, preventing, treatment in cervical and breast cancers, and oral cancers  especially in hard-to-reach places around the world. Its within our power. Vice President Joe Biden meets with Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Secretary of State, at the Apostolic Palace, in Vatican City, April 29, 2016.

12357,The Dolphin Rape Myth,"Google the term dolphin rape and youll find countless references to male dolphins raping female dolphins, males raping other males, gang rape, and even dolphins raping humans. You might even find this hoax webpage claiming that dolphins regularly kidnap swimmers and take them to a rape cave. Head over to Google Scholar, however, and you will find exactly zero references to dolphin rape in the scientific peer-reviewed literature. The reason for this discrepancy is quite simple: the term rape cannot be used to describe the kinds of behavior scientists have observed in dolphins. The central problem is that the legal definitions of rape include a lack of consent on the part of the victim, and we simply cannot know the extent to which dolphins or other animals are able to give consent. A non-consensual act like rape has moral and legal implications that are only relevant in the human world, which is why animal scientists (pretty much) stopped using the term altogether in the early 1980s. The correct scientific term to describe when a male aggressively restrains a female in order to mate is forced copulation. Forced copulation has been observed in ducks, lizards, monkeys, fruit flies, crickets, orangutans, chimpanzees, and countless other species. But not dolphins. Despite the media frenzy around the idea of dolphin rape, its primates, birds and insects that are the forced copulation aficionados, not dolphins. What follows is a brief rundown of all of the aggressive sexual behaviors that scientists have observed in dolphins that often find their way into popular reports discussing dolphin rape: Sexual Coercion: Sexual Coercion is a term describing a suite of behaviors observed most frequently in the bottlenose dolphins of Shark Bay Australia and Sarasota Bay Florida. Individuals or groups of males use a variety of coercive tactics to increase their chances of mating with females. In Shark Bay, groups of male dolphins are often seen in the company of an individual female for extended periods of time (referred to as a consortship). Sometimes these males begin the consortship by herding (i.e., chasing and corralling) the female, although other times the female appears to enter the consortship willingly. These males sometimes use aggressive behavior to keep the female close to them and to fend off rival males, and its during these consortships that mating takes place. In Sarasota, males also follow females around when its time to mate (a form of mate guarding), but rarely engage in aggressive behavior directed at the female like in Shark Bay. Dolphins might use other tactics to persuade a female to mate with them, including committing infanticide (i.e., killing calves) so that the females will come into estrus and be more receptive. But heres the thing: even in the clearly aggressive coercion scenarios witnessed in Shark Bay, researchers have never witnessed forced copulation. The kind of coercion being described here is indirect in that these tactics ultimately result in males persuading females to mate with them, but not directly forcing themselves on the females. The scientific experts studying the Shark Bay dolphins had this to say about forced copulation in a recent book: We have no evidence of direct sexual coercion in dolphins, including forced copulation or other behaviors directly associated with male attempts to mate. In other words, if forced copulation should be considered the non-human animal equivalent to rape insofar as it appears (to the human observer) as if the female has not given consent, then this still has never been observed in dolphins. This fact alone is a strong argument against the use of the word rape to describe any dolphin mating strategies. Socio-Sexual behavior: The below video has been mislabeled as Dolphins Mating, and purportedly shows two males and one female dolphin. In fact, there are three male dolphins in this video. This group of young males is engaging in what scientists call socio-sexual behavior. This is a blanket term that describes any social behavior involving penises that does not involve a male trying to impregnate a female. Sometimes the dolphins simply rub all over each other while brandishing erections, and sometimes they actually insert their penises in each others anuses or genital slits. Unlike true mating, which usually take the form of the male swimming belly-to-belly underneath a female, socio-sexual behavior often involves the male approaching the other dolphin (male or female) from behind or the side. Sometimes it looks rather brutal and aggressive, and sometimes, like in the below video, the animals seem pretty chill. There are a variety of reasons dolphins engage in these behaviors, ranging from establishing or maintaining social bonds and friendships, to blowing off steam, punishing rivals, or simply having a grand old time. Its difficult to know exactly what is going through the dolphins minds when watching socio-sexual behavior unfold, and whether or not any of the observed penile penetration is consensual. Regardless, it does not resemble forced copulation. Mounting: You can easily find examples online of dolphins with erections and thrusting behavior directed at human swimmers (like here, and here). Its impossible to know if penetration is their intention (i.e., some form of penetration being another criterion in the definition of human rape), or if its the dolphin equivalent of a dog humping your leg. Mounting behavior (which does not always involve penetration, especially since females sometime do the mounting) has been studied in a number of animal species, and the list of proposed functions for this behavior is diverse: play behavior, solidifying maternal bonds, dominance, aggression, establishment and maintenance of social bonds, conflict resolution, and of course sexual gratification. Mounting behavior in dolphins is widespread and is a form of socio-sexual behavior. It involves dolphins of all ages and both sexes. Juveniles and calves will sometimes mount their mothers (and vice versa) and females will mount males. Despite documented mounting attempts involving dolphins and humans, I have found no verified accounts of a male dolphin having ever penetrated a human orifice with his penis (against their will or otherwise). So heres the bottom line: calling any of this behavior rape trivializes the word rape. It either downplays the horrific human behavior of rape by jokingly misapplying it to quirky animal behavior, or unnecessarily vilifies what is, for dolphins, a diverse catalog of behaviors that might not cause the dolphins involved very much stress, and might even be consensual 100% of the time. In most cases involving male dolphins using aggressive strategies to mate with females, the correct term is sexual coercion, which is NOT synonymous with rape. Unlike rape, sexual coercion might involve consent on the part of the female, and involves many indirect coercive behaviors (e.g., herding, infanticide), and not just forced copulation. In any event, forced copulation as a sexual coercion technique has never been observed in dolphins. In cases where males are directing their penises at the bodies and orifices of other dolphins where reproduction is not the goal, or engage in mounting behavior, the correct term is probably socio-sexual behavior. Again, socio-sexual behavior might involve consent, and does not always involve penetration or forced copulation. The dolphins are rapists meme easily lends itself to being a trendy t-shirt, or link-bait headline, but rape is undoubtedly the wrong term to apply to dolphin behavior. It is a loaded term that really should be used solely to describe the fundamentally horrific, and uniquely human crime of rape as defined by the law. There is no dolphin equivalent. *************** Further reading on sexual coercion and socio-sexual behavior in dolphins: Connor R.C., Vollmer N. 2009.

13263,"6 things Bernie Sanders would do to crack down on fracking, even if Congress doesnt go along","Bernie Sanders wants to halt fracking not just on public land but on private land too. How would he actually do that? Grist talked to the Sanders campaign to get previously unreleased specifics about the kinds of strategies he would use if he makes it to the Oval Office. Sanders hasnt proposed eliminating conventional oil and gas drilling or coal mining on private land, but he believes that hydraulic fracturing, AKA fracking, is especially problematic. It involves injecting secret chemical brews at high pressure deep into the earth to unleash previously inaccessible deposits of gas and oil, a process that can contaminate local air and water and even cause earthquakes. Sanders recently called for passing a law that would dramatically scale back fracking on private land by closing the so-called Halliburton loophole that exempts fracking operations from the Safe Drinking Water Act. That change would allow EPA to regulate whats in fracking fluids and how they are used. But, like so many of Sanders proposals, this anti-fracking measure would stand no chance of passing Congress, as the House is sure to stay in Republican hands and the Senate might too. Sanders didnt publicly offer a list of backup plans for cracking down on fracking through executive action, so Grist asked his campaign what he would do about fracking if Congress wouldnt pass his bill. The campaign offered up a number of policy proposals a president could enact on his or her own, geared around these basic principles: stop letting fracking operations pollute their neighbors air and water, and stop incentivizing a switch in the energy sector from coal to natural gas. Instead of embracing gas as a supposedly cleaner bridge fuel, Sanders wants to go straight to renewables. Here are the six most significant executive actions that a President Sanders would likely take to put the squeeze on fracking and natural gas: Change the Clean Power Plan to incentivize renewables instead of gas. The biggest problem with Obamas signature climate initiative is that it is structured in such a way as to encourage states to shift their power plants from burning coal to gas. It also encourages switching to renewable energy, of course, and during the first two years EPA will provide states with emissions credits specifically for certain renewable investments such as wind and solar projects in low-income communities, through whats called the Clean Energy Incentive Program. Sanders would extend that program through the CPPs lifetime, all the way to 2030. Regulate methane, not just carbon, through the Clean Power Plan. One of the reasons the CPP implicitly favors gas is that it only measures and regulates carbon dioxide emissions, which come from a power plants smokestack when a fossil fuel is burned. By that measure, gas is only half as bad as coal. But when natural gas is extracted through fracking and piped to power plants, methane leaks out, a greenhouse gas thats 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide over 20 years. So much methane leaks through that studies suggest it totally wipes out the climate advantage of gas over coal. Extending the CPP to cover methane would mean that natural gas is properly assessed for its climate impact. Use the Clean Air Act to regulate methane leakage from existing sources and strengthen rules on new sources. Last year, EPA proposed regulation of methane leakage from new sources, such as wells and pipelines. But the vast majority of methane leakage comes from existing sources, so Sanders would have EPA regulate them as well. Sanders also wants to make the EPAs rules for new sources more stringent. Regulate containment of fracking fluid under the Clean Water Act. The fluids injected into the earth in fracking operations dont just stay down there, they come back up. Typically, they are poured into containment ponds, which can be exposed to the open air and overflow in storms, leak through holes, and so on. Under Sanders, EPA would create rules for safer containment of used fracking fluid. Investigate the effects of fracking. EPA has abandoned its studies of the risks of water contamination from fracking. Sanders staffers say that under his presidency, the agency would carefully study the effects of fracking and publicize the results. Support state and local efforts to ban fracking. The power of the presidents bully pulpit to exhort people to do what he or she wants can be overstated. But if the president publicly highlights the dangers of fracking, praising state and local governments that have banned fracking and encouraging others to follow their lead, it might help at the margins. These moves would serve the same basic purpose: stop letting natural gas be artificially cheap by sticking the rest of society with the cost for water, air, and climate pollution. By limiting that pollution and requiring gas companies to spend more money on protecting surrounding communities, Sanders would raise the cost of fracking and the gas and oil it produces. You impact the market through regulatory authority, says one Sanders aide. Its good to know that the Sanders team has these pragmatic plans for grinding out small-bore victories if their wholesale political revolution doesnt come to pass. Sanders skyrocketed from obscurity to winning the New Hampshire primary largely on the strength of his idealistic legislative proposals like a $15-per-hour minimum wage. His climate and environment proposals are idealistic too. In December, Sanders released an impressive climate action plan that is based heavily on bills that would have to be passed through Congress  and wont be passed any time soon without a massive partisan and ideological swing in its membership. Sanders cant be blamed for talking mainly about his dream legislation. Everyone else does it too. Its not like a Republican Congress would pass Hillary Clintons more modest proposals, or a Senate in which Democrats can filibuster would pass Donald Trumps massive tax cuts. This is how presidential candidates campaign. Much as it may irritate wonks, most voters want to hear a candidates big, unrealistic proposals because it tells them what that person believes in and the direction he or she would take the country. The question is whether a candidate can also offer concrete policies that are actually achievable. On fracking, Sanders is now showing that he can.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/10/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-bernie-sanders-wants-delay-cl/,Science,Polifact
14770,Sheldon Whitehouse: Climate change in a tsunami of denial,"Climate change denial is a castle built on sand. Its collapse is inevitable. The question is, can we get real in time to avert the worst damage to our beautiful Ocean State? To do that, we need to enact... Climate change denial is a castle built on sand. Its collapse is inevitable. The question is, can we get real in time to avert the worst damage to our beautiful Ocean State? To do that, we need to enact a nationwide price on carbon pollution to make the market work properly and discourage dumping carbon into our atmosphere. Heres why I think we can. First, the days of free carbon pollution end this June, when the Obama administration announces regulations on the biggest emitters. That wont just lower the polluters emissions, it will change their thinking. When their free-pollution holiday is over, a nationwide carbon fee may start to look better to them. Second, the polluters have had a political field day since the Citizens United decision allowed unlimited dark money into our elections  what one newspaper called the tsunami of slime. That one-sided assault is coming to an end as environmental money begins to match the polluters in elections. The environmental money will still be less, but it has the advantage of a truthful message. Third, major brand-name corporations like Walmart, General Motors, Coca-Cola, Apple, Mars and many others have terrific climate policies. They just havent all put their communications or government relations effort in line with their sustainability work. The military gets how serious this is and has listed climate change as a national security threat; commander of the U.S. Pacific Command Adm. Samuel Lochlear has said its our worst threat in the Pacific Theater. When these voices are heard more clearly it will be devastating to the denier apparatus. Fourth, the denier apparatus is a phony: front organizations designed to look like theyre real; bogus messages designed to sound like theyre truthful; a whole big charade connected to and funded by polluters. Phonies dont last. Most important, the climate deniers have lost the public. Independents and Democrats overwhelmingly support action on climate change, and most Republican voters under 35 in a recent poll said climate deniers are ignorant, out of touch, or crazy. Republican mayors and governors, away from the polluter money choking Congress, are getting to work on climate change. Republican economists support a carbon tax. Republicans increasingly see they cannot possibly win the 2016 presidential race with a denier candidate. Before Citizens United, many Republican senators were working on and voting for climate legislation. Republican friends in the Senate have complained to me that the polluter money attacks Republicans in primaries, not just Democrats in general elections. The polluters, post-Citizens United, have run a coal-fired purge of the Republican Party in Congress. But even vast polluter money can only bully them quiet for so long  and when compliance is imposed by fear, disruptions are abrupt. When the denial castle collapses, the prospects for a serious carbon bill in Congress are good. The revenues from a revenue-neutral carbon fee are all returned to the public, and there are appealing ways to do that: lowering corporate tax rates from 35 to 30 percent would be a huge value to good corporate citizens such as CVS and its consumers; giving seniors on Social Security a raise, or students (and their parents) relief on college loans would please many Rhode Islanders; a straight-out check to heads of households would be possible. There are already more American jobs in the solar industry than in coal mining, and were near tipping points where solar is the cheaper power even ignoring the extra harm done by carbon pollution. America has a prosperous clean energy future to look forward to, and theres more economic security in our own American know-how than in corrupt foreign fossil fuel countries. More than anything, as an optimist, I believe this will get done because it must. April was the first month in human history with consistently more than 400 parts per million of carbon in the atmosphere (for at least 8,000 centuries its been between 175 and 300 ppm). Sea level at the tide gauge off the Newport Navy base is up about 10 inches since the Hurricane of 1938, because warming seas expand (and swallow our beaches). Our orchards are seeing unaccustomed winter blooms, which are very risky, if a hard cold snap follows  ask the Michigan cherry industry. Our commercial fishermen see fish in Rhode Island Sound like tarpon and grouper that their fathers never saw, and have lost important fisheries like the winter flounder; lobster are moving offshore to cooler waters; as one fisherman said to me, Its getting weird out there. Rainbursts now cause 100-year flooding every few years  even 500-year flooding in Cranston three years ago. Rhode Islands first summer residents were Southern traders, come to avoid the fetid Carolina heat; now that heat is marching northward to become our summers. And dont be misled, the links connecting these results to carbon pollution are forged in immutable laws of science and nature. We simply have to get this right. Rhode Island has too much at stake to fail.

15106,Benz Patent Motor Car: The first automobile  | Daimler,"The first stationary gasoline engine developed by Carl Benz was a one-cylinder two-stroke unit which ran for the first time on New Years Eve 1879. Benz had so much commercial success with this engine that he was able to devote more time to his dream of creating a lightweight car powered by a gasoline engine, in which the chassis and engine formed a single unit. The major features of the two-seater vehicle, which was completed in 1885, were the compact high-speed single-cylinder four-stroke engine installed horizontally at the rear, the tubular steel frame, the differential and three wire-spoked wheels. The engine output was 0.75 hp (0.55 kW). Details included an automatic intake slide, a controlled exhaust valve, high-voltage electrical vibrator ignition with spark plug, and water/thermo siphon evaporation cooling. On January 29, 1886, Carl Benz applied for a patent for his vehicle powered by a gas engine. The patent  number 37435  may be regarded as the birth certificate of the automobile. In July 1886 the newspapers reported on the first public outing of the three-wheeled Benz Patent Motor Car, model no. 1. Using an improved version and without her husbands knowledge, Benzs wife Bertha and their two sons Eugen (15) and Richard (14) embarked on the first long-distance journey in automotive history on an August day in 1888. The route included a few detours and took them from Mannheim to Pforzheim, her place of birth. With this journey of 180 kilometers including the return trip Bertha Benz demonstrated the practicality of the motor vehicle to the entire world. Without her daring  and that of her sons  and the decisive stimuli that resulted from it, the subsequent growth of Benz & Cie. in Mannheim to become the worlds largest automobile plant of its day would have been unthinkable. Double-pivot steering, contra engine, planetary gear transmission (1891  1897) Double-pivot steering It was Carl Benz who had the double-pivot steering system patented in 1893, thereby solving one of the most urgent problems of the automobile. The first Benz with this steering system was the three-hp (2.2-kW) Victoria in 1893, of which slightly larger numbers with different bodies were built. The worlds first production car with some 1200 units built was the Benz Velo of 1894, a lightweight, durable and inexpensive compact car. 1897 saw the development of the twin engine consisting of two horizontal single-cylinder units in parallel, however this proved unsatisfactory. It was immediately followed by a better design, the contra engine in which the cylinders were arranged opposite each other. This was the birth of the horizontally-opposed piston engine. Always installed at the rear by Benz until 1900, this unit generated up to 16 hp (12 kW) in various versions.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/13/laura-ingraham/did-americans-invent-car-ingraham-says-so/,Science,Polifact
16156,Heidi Heilman: Marijuana follows Big Tobaccos lead,"WESTBOROUGH, Mass.Science and public health should inform drug policy decisions  not public opinion and a national campaign funded by a giant industry that sells an addictive, psychotropic drug. Its... WESTBOROUGH, Mass. Science and public health should inform drug policy decisions  not public opinion and a national campaign funded by a giant industry that sells an addictive, psychotropic drug. Its depressing that Rhode Island Rep. Edith H. Ajello and Sen. Joshua Miller are promoting legalization by using the exact talking points of the multimillion-dollar, pro-marijuana lobby. The science is clear: marijuana use has been linked to mental illness, depression, psychosis, permanent loss of IQ and memory, heightened risk of heart attack or stroke, likelihood of dropping out of school, addiction to other drugs and testicular cancer. Big Marijuana is doing all it can to cast doubt on these scientific facts in the same way that Big Tobacco succeeded in hiding the dangers of cigarette smoking for more than 80 years. A growing body of research is showing how the cannabinoid system and the opioid system of the brain are intimately connected. Modifying one modifies the other. Surely, it is no coincidence that Vermont and New Hampshire, both medical marijuana states, and both at the top of the list for youth marijuana rates in this country (Vermont is number one; New Hampshire is number two), also have soaring rates of opiate and heroin use. Not all pot smokers move to heroin, but if they start in their teen years, the risk of evolving to opiate and/or heroin addiction is significantly increased. New Hampshires heroin deaths have doubled this year. In February, the Denver Post reported that Colorado ski towns are experiencing an unprecedented spike in heroin deaths and abuse, and rates in the Rocky Mountain State are at their highest in a decade. Boulder is burdened with serious issues of street violence and homelessness  direct outcomes of marijuana legalization that dont seem to be reaching New Englands newspapers. Todays marijuana is 300 percent to 800 percent more potent than the pot of yesteryear. Such dangerous levels of THC heighten mental illness and addiction risks for those who smoke marijuana  especially for kids with developing brains. Research is clear that the teen brain is primed for chemical dependency: One in six of those who use marijuana before age 18 become addicted. For the big business of marijuana, this is basic market research. Like the tobacco industry, it must hook the underage population with really high-grade, potent stuff. The demand for addictive products increases when they are legal, easily accessible and aggressively marketed. Data shows 52 percent of the U.S. public uses alcohol, a legal drug, and 7.3 percent uses marijuana, an illegal drug. What happens if we legalize marijuana and use rises to 25 percent, 35 percent or 50 percent? Open up the psych wards, treatment centers and assisted living beds, America, and watch your social and public school costs soar. When half the country is smoking pot, the rest of us will be pulling a wagon full of people dazed in a psychiatric haze of smoke. Legalization is not the solution to incarceration, as Representative Ajello and Senator Miller claim. Sentencing reform that leads to treatment, recovery and strong supports is the better alternative and will yield a more healthy, productive populace. We must focus on practical changes in marijuana policy that neither demonize users nor legalize the drug. Through sound measures, we can reduce incarceration and marijuana rates. Big Tobacco kept the public in the dark for a half century by clouding evidence that smoking caused lung cancer. It was strategic and it was effective. Smoking remains the number one cause of preventable death, killing 5 million people per year. Big Marijuana is following the same playbook  clouding evidence of harm. As the industry takes root, expect big tobacco companies to take over. A 1970s tobacco industry report on marijuana states, We have the land to grow it, the technology to mass produce it, and the distribution to market it. Just three years ago, in Indonesia, cigarettes were legally sold to children of any age and advertisements saturated the media, associating smoking with independence, sex, adventure and youth. During an interview with Vanguard, Ita Rahma, a young tobacco control activist, referred to tobacco as Indonesias smelly fish, explaining, we have a saying: when you hide a smelly fish, you cant hide it forever because the smell will come out eventually. Marijuana is being positioned as harmless, and the emerging industry is luring in our youth. Marijuana is now Americas smelly fish and more and more of us are starting to pick up the stench.

17920,The Committee on Energy and Commerce,"Barton: Medicare Drug Program Drawing Participants by the Thousands WASHINGTON - U.S. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, made the following statement today during the full committee hearing on the Administration's FY '07 Health Care Priorities: ""Good afternoon. Let me begin by welcoming Secretary Michael Leavitt today to the Energy and Commerce Committee. We look forward to hearing him testify about the Administration's Fiscal Year 2007 Health Care Priorities. ""First, Mr. Secretary, I want to thank you for your assistance in developing the important reforms we put into place for the Medicaid program starting this year. As a former governor yourself, you understood and appreciated the need to improve this program. Through passage of the Deficit Reduction Act, we will sustain Medicaid for those people who most often need health care and to get good get their health care through good jobs in a thriving economy instead of from a government welfare program. The reforms we adopted recently are beginning to rescue the program from the threat of financial collapse. I look forward to working with you to see that the governors get the tools they need to better manage the program and deliver its benefits to the poor of their states. ""I want to briefly highlight at least some of the changes in the law that have not recently received the public attention that they deserve. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 115,000 disabled children covered by the Family Opportunity Act will receive improved health care services as a result of the recently passed Deficit Reduction Act. The new law will provide access to new home and community based care to 120,000 individuals; and it will facilitate 100,000 nursing home residents to return to their communities through the Administration's Money Follows the Person Demonstration. These are the true results of Medicaid reform - better access to better care for those who most need our assistance. ""There is still much to be done to improve long-term care service delivery and financing as well as to promote Medicaid managed care. I have received the administration's proposals regarding additional improvement to the Medicaid program and I look forward to working with you this year on them. ""This year the secretary and the administration also are required to administer the new Medicare prescription drug benefit. Making this program succeed is a high priority of yours, and it is a high priority of this committee that I chair. ""Since it began, critics have tried to make patients believe that they are not smart enough to understand the new Medicare drug benefit, that it provides inadequate coverage, and that signing up isn't worth their time because it cannot save them any money. The critics are simply wrong. They were wrong when they complained about the Medicare prescription drug card. They were wrong when they said nobody would offer any insurance plans. And they are wrong now. ""Some sense political advantage in condemning the program and others can't bring themselves to admit that free markets actually work. Transparency and competition will drive down prices and provide lower costs to consumers. Even if the critics don't get it, Medicare beneficiaries certainly do. That is why over 3.6 million Medicare beneficiaries have already signed up for the new benefit. You told me earlier today that there are close to 24 million Americans that have been enrolled in the program, through one means or another, and enrollment is increasing at approximately 250,000 people per week. That sounds like a success story to me. If you add that to the fact that the premiums which we estimated at $37 a month is now down to an average $27 per month, that appears to me to be a successful program. ""This is a huge undertaking and there are going to be glitches. My goal is the same as yours: Get rid of the glitches. The committee will work closely with yourself and Dr. Mark McClellan at CMS to get problems noticed and solved. We will have the first of what will likely be several hearings on this topic on March 1, when Dr. McClellan will testify before the Health subcommittee. I expect that we ask him very direct questions about where the problems are and what CMS is doing to fix them. ""Another high priority for the committee will be the reauthorization of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and related programs. I want to restate my deep commitment to reauthorizing the NIH and would ask for the secretary's assistance in working out the technical details so that we can enact this long overdue legislation. In addition, the authorization for the Ryan White CARE Act has now lapsed. I believe that funding unauthorized programs is not a responsible practice, and I anticipate that the committee will work to reauthorize these programs this year. ""I also intend to work with you this year on ways to reform Medicare reimbursement, and particularly focus on physician payment reform. In order to preserve access to Medicare services for future generations, we must look at how we are spending our Medicare dollars today and what are the incentives are for our physician community to continue providing quality health care. ""Another top priority of the committee will be to work with you on the proposals outlined in the Administration's budget to provide consumers with greater access to comparative price and quality data about their health care providers. I could go on, but my time has expired."" ####",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/13/steve-israel/medicare-part-d-and-obamacare-health-care-gov/,Science,Polifact
18128,Congressman Lashes Out in Obamacare Hearing: This Is a 'Monkey Court!',"Not only that, but the language, as detailed by the conservative Weekly Standard, is itself commented out. Developers will occasionally put marks around lines of code telling the computer, in essence, ""ignore this."" (Why? Often developers will leave notes like ""// Section two begins here"" to make code easier to scan.) In this case, the language was likely commented out because the document, a fairly standard ""Terms and Conditions"" page, was repurposed form another project. Take standard legal language, comment out the parts you won't use, and done. (Update: Expert Clay Johnson suggests that the use of a template is exactly what happened. It wasn't commented out, though  just never activated by the code to appear.) Barton is also confusing two types of privacy: the privacy afforded under HIPAA (discussed below) and the privacy that is necessary for online communication. Earlier this year, Google came under fire when it was reported that its attorneys argued that GMail users didn't have a reasonable expectation of privacy. As The Verge pointed out, this is a fairly common legal stipulation that allows online companies to process information submitted online. When you send your emails to Google, you acknowledge that Google has a right to see who sent the message and where it's going, and so on. It would be hard to maintain that information privately and have your email get to its destination! The language commented out in the source code of one page of Healthcare.gov is almost certainly similar in its intent. The witness from CGI Federal mentioned none of this. When Barton wrapped up, Pallone jumped in. First, he pointed out that there was no legal violation. Pallone: I started out in my opening statement saying there was no legitimacy to this hearing and the last line of the questioning certainly confirms is that. HIPAA only applies when there's health information being provided. That's not in play here today. No health information is required in the application process. And why is that? Because pre-existing conditions don't matter! So once again, here we have my Republican colleagues trying to scare everybody  Barton, interrupting: If the gentleman will yield? Pallone: No, I will not yield to this monkey court or whatever  Barton: This is not a monkey court! Pallone's point is valid: There is no personal health information submitted to the Healthcare.gov site  though other personal information is. One of the problems with Healthcare.gov is that it is complex, has a large number of interlocking parts. Barton's critique identified one of the little bits of messiness that, at its heart, is unimportant. But given the contentiousness of the debate over Obamacare  again on display on Thursday  that line of attack might spread. Photo: Barton in 2010.

19286,Interview With President Obama,"So the entire intention of the speech is to make sure that we are focused on the right thing. It doesnt mean that I expect Republicans to agree with all my prescriptions, but it is to say that the central problem we face and the one that we faced now that the immediate crisis is over is how do we build a broad-based prosperity. And I want to make sure that all of us in Washington are investing as much time, as much energy, as much debate on how we grow the economy and grow the middle class as weve spent over the last two to three years arguing about how we reduce the deficits. NYT: But do you worry, Mr. President, that that description of that sort of standing pat, what happens if you stand pat and the sort of slower than expected -- do you worry that that could end up being your legacy simply because of the obstruction that -- and the gridlock that doesnt seem to end? MR. OBAMA: Well, lets separate it from me for a second, because I think if Im arguing for entirely different policies and Congress ends up pursuing policies that I think dont make sense and we get a bad result, its hard to argue thatd be my legacy. And so Ill worry about my legacy later or Ill let historians worry about my legacy. I do worry about whats happening to ordinary families here is Galesburg and all across the country. When we know that rebuilding our infrastructure right now would put people back to work and its never been cheaper for us to do so, and this is all deferred maintenance that were going to have to do at some point anyway, I worry that were not moving faster to seize the moment. When we know that families are getting killed by college costs, for us not to take bold action -- which means that young people are graduating with massive debt, they cant buy a home as soon as they want, they cant start that business that theyve got a great idea for -- that worries me. So as I suggested in the speech, what I want to make sure everybody in Washington is obsessed with is how are we growing the economy, how are we increasing middle-class incomes and middle-class wages, and increasing middle-class security. And if were not talking about that, then were talking about the wrong thing. And if our debates around the budget dont have that in mind, then weve got the wrong focus. NYT: Well, you said it yourself in the speech that Washington has taken its eye off the ball. Do you have any -- are you culpable at all in that? Did you -- its six -- its July now, its almost August. Do you wish you were giving a speech like this earlier and done it more often? Advertisement Continue reading the main story MR. OBAMA: If you look over the last six months, we right away delivered on the promise to make sure that our tax code was more reflective of our values; that middle-class families locked in relief that they needed; folks like me, at the very top, paid a little bit more. That, by the way, was a fundamental shift that was a decade in the making. That was a big argument. Immediately after that, obviously, we had the tragedy in Newtown and the need for a response. And my wish and hope had been that that was a quicker piece of business and that we had gone ahead and moved forward on that. Immigration reform actually squarely fits into what Im discussing right now. As I indicated before, we know the economy will grow faster if we get immigration reform done. We know that Social Security will be shored up if we get immigration reform done. And the Senates done the right thing by passing a strong bipartisan bill. So what I will absolutely admit to is that Ive been here  Ive been in Washington long enough now to know that if once a week Im not talking about jobs, the economy, and the middle class, then all manner of distraction fills the void. NYT: Is there any part of your agenda moving forward that you think you are willing to move to the backburner so that you can spend more time on the economy? MR. OBAMA: Well, immigration reform weve got to get done, and that right now is just a matter of the House Republicans recognizing that both the American people, businesses, labor, evangelicals -- theres a broad consensus to go ahead and pass that bill, and if that bill was on the floor tomorrow it would pass. Beyond that, though, were working on a range of other issues -- from climate change to reforming government to reducing the backlog in the VA. So theres a bunch of stuff were going to be doing. I will be spending my time over the next several weeks talking about the issues in more detail that I discussed today so that by the time Congress gets back in the fall, I want to make sure that the American people are paying attention and asking themselves, are we doing everything we can to boost middle-class incomes, ladders of opportunity, and middle-class security. Advertisement Continue reading the main story And if were doing that, then ultimately I think that we wont get everything done that I want to see done, but we will have shifted away from what I think has been a bad  a damaging framework in Washington, which is to constantly think about is there more we can do to cut the deficit without asking are we making the right cuts, the smart cuts that actually help people in their own lives and help us grow over the long term. NYT: Well, in contrast with the jobs plan thats now what youre reflecting today, its almost two years old now, and which would measurably add to employment the studies show. MR. OBAMA: Right. NYT: But in contrast with that, the policies that have been in place since the start of your second term, fiscal policies -- MR. OBAMA: Right, because of the sequester. NYT: -- that you and Congress agreed to -- right -- and some of the laws -- the payroll tax cut, and the increase in upper-end taxes to some extent -- but all of those things are by any economists measure a drag on the economy. Theres not a day goes by I dont get some analyst saying that -- and that the Fed is pursuing expansionary policies to offset that. How can you -- how are you going to -- what exactly can you do between now and the end of the year to overcome the Republicans opposition and change that, to end sequester? MR. OBAMA: Well, let me back up, Jackie. First of all, as the economy got stronger during the course of my presidency, I had always committed to a responsible reduction in the deficit. I think that was the smart thing to do, the right thing to do, and good for our growth. And if were growing faster, if businesses and the markets have more confidence, then ultimately that benefits middle-class families as well. So I make no apologies for putting forward budgets consistently that, as I had promised, would gradually reduce the deficit. Now, the sequester I did not want to be in place. When you say I agreed to it, what happened, as you will recall, in 2011 is, is that we had the prospect of either default or a willingness on the part of Republicans and Democrats to spend a year and a half trying to come up with a sensible way to reduce the deficit. The sequester was supposed to be something that was so damaging to the economy that both parties would want to avoid it. The fact that Republicans embraced the sequester as what they consider a win during the course of this year, despite all the damage that they said they wanted to avoid, for example, to our military, is different from me agreeing to the sequester. All right? So thats point number one. Point number two, every economist will tell you that if we are being smart about growth and were thinking about jobs and were thinking about the middle class, but were also thinking about fiscal responsibility, then what we should be doing is making sure that the drop-off in government spending on vital things like education and infrastructure dont go down too fast, and that rather we look at what the real problem is, which is long-term health care costs. Because of the Affordable Care Act and a lot of changes that are taking place out there among providers, were starting to see health care costs slow. Thats a positive. If we can build on that, then we can capture the same amount of savings that were capturing through the sequester and use those to make sure that were not cutting vital investments that I talked about today, and we can help middle-class families. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Now, I think there are probably going to be 15 different ways for you guys to ask me the same question, which is, But theres Congress. (Laughter.) More specifically, Theres the House Republicans, and what are you going to do about that? NYT: Who are still embracing sequestration and who are still willing to use the debt limit to go to the mat. MR. OBAMA: Well, this is what they say. On the other hand, we also have a number of very thoughtful and sensible Republicans over in the Senate who have said that we should not play brinksmanship, that we should come up with a long-term plan. I met with a couple of House Republicans over the last several weeks who would like to see that happen. Theyre not the loudest voices in the room at the moment. And part of what Id like to see over the next several weeks is, if were having a conversation thats framed as how are we growing the economy, how are we strengthening the middle class, how are we putting people back to work, how are we making college more affordable, how are we bringing manufacturing back -- the answer to those questions I think force a different result than if we are constantly asking ourselves how can we cut the deficit more, faster, sooner. NYT: Have you yielded anything from your outreach to Republicans? And do you still have hope for a 10-year deal by the end of the year? MR. OBAMA: I think its still possible. There are certainly Republicans who are deeply concerned about the effects of sequester. Its been interesting -- Ive talked to a number of them who are from deeply red states, consider themselves very conservative, who say it doesnt make sense for us to cut discretionary spending more; it doesnt make sense for us to cut education further -- because theyre seeing the impacts in their districts. Certainly there are a bunch of Republicans who say for us to hollow out our military as steeply, drastically as were doing if sequester stays in place for next year makes no sense. So if the American people have confidence that theres a path that will grow the economy faster, put more people back to work, that doesnt involve massive new federal spending programs, but instead just make sure that were investing in the right things, and if were being attentive to debt and deficits over a 20, 30-year time horizon, then potentially some of those Republicans start giving voice to their concerns a little more loudly than theyre doing right now. But one of the challenges, as I said in the speech, is that theres almost a kneejerk habit right now that if Im for it, then theyve got to be against it. And I think there are a lot of Republicans who are frustrated by that, because they want to be for something, not just against something. But theyve got to work through that pattern thats developed over the last couple of years. Advertisement Continue reading the main story NYT: A couple of slightly different topics. On the economy, the Fed is obviously an important player. Youve got a big decision ahead of yourself in terms of the chairman. What are you looking for in a chairman? And there were reports yesterday that you are very close to naming Larry Summers as the new Fed chairman. True? MR. OBAMA: I have not made a final decision. Ive narrowed it down to some extraordinarily qualified candidates. NYT: Do you want to say who? MR. OBAMA: No. (Laughter.) NYT: I tried. MR. OBAMA: And what Im looking for is somebody who understands the Fed has a dual mandate, that thats not just lip service; that it is very important to keep inflation in check, to keep our dollar sound, and to ensure stability in the markets. But the idea is not just to promote those things in the abstract. The idea is to promote those things in service of the lives of ordinary Americans getting better. And when unemployment is still too high, and long-term unemployment is still too high, and theres still weak demand in a lot of industries, I want a Fed chairman that can step back and look at that objectively and say, lets make sure that were growing the economy, but lets also keep an eye on inflation, and if it starts heating up, if the markets start frothing up, lets make sure that were not creating new bubbles.

View all New York Times newsletters. NYT: And do you have a timeline in mind for announcing that? MR. OBAMA: I think you can anticipate that over the next several months, an announcement will be made. Ben Bernanke, by the way, has done a fine job as Fed chairman. And when you look at Ben Bernankes testimony, not just last week but over the last couple of years, what hes consistently said is right now, our priority needs to be growing the economy faster and strengthening incomes for ordinary Americans. If we do that, our deficits come down because were bringing in more revenue. If we do that, it becomes easier for us to handle the long-term fiscal challenges. And one of the interesting things that we dont talk about enough is the contrast between whats happened in the United States and whats happened in a lot of other developing countries, Europe in particular. It's pretty rare where we have the chance to look at two policy approaches and follow them over several years and see which one worked. And the fact is there are a lot of European countries who followed the prescription that the House Republicans are calling for right now, and not only have they lagged well below where we've gone in terms of growth, in many cases their debt and their deficits have actually gone up because their economy is still effectively in recession. And although we havent been growing as fast as we would like, we have consistently outperformed those countries that followed the recipe that the House Republicans are offering right now. Now, Im more sympathetic to those European countries because they, in some cases, didnt have a choice. They dont have the dominant world currency. They dont have people who want to invest in their countries the way folks around the world still want to invest in ours. But in some ways, we've got evidence here. This is not an abstract argument. We know what's needed to make our economy grow right now. And if we grow our economy, and middle-class families are doing better, and housing prices are stronger, and young people are starting families of their own and theyre jobs at good wages, thats the thing that will bring deficits down the fastest. NYT: A couple other quick subjects that are economic-related. Keystone pipeline -- Republicans especially talk about that as a big job creator. You've said that you would approve it only if you could be assured it would not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon in the atmosphere. Is there anything that Canada could do or the oil companies could do to offset that as a way of helping you to reach that decision? Advertisement Continue reading the main story MR. OBAMA: Well, first of all, Michael, Republicans have said that this would be a big jobs generator. There is no evidence that thats true. And my hope would be that any reporter who is looking at the facts would take the time to confirm that the most realistic estimates are this might create maybe 2,000 jobs during the construction of the pipeline -- which might take a year or two -- and then after that were talking about somewhere between 50 and 100 [chuckles] jobs in a economy of 150 million working people. NYT: Yet there are a number of unions who want you to approve this. MR. OBAMA: Well, look, they might like to see 2,000 jobs initially. But that is a blip relative to the need. So what we also know is, is that that oil is going to be piped down to the Gulf to be sold on the world oil markets, so it does not bring down gas prices here in the United States. In fact, it might actually cause some gas prices in the Midwest to go up where currently they cant ship some of that oil to world markets. Now, having said that, there is a potential benefit for us integrating further with a reliable ally to the north our energy supplies. But I meant what I said; I'm going to evaluate this based on whether or not this is going to significantly contribute to carbon in our atmosphere. And there is no doubt that Canada at the source in those tar sands could potentially be doing more to mitigate carbon release. NYT: And if they did, could that offset the concerns about the pipeline itself? MR. OBAMA: We haven't seen specific ideas or plans. But all of that will go into the mix in terms of John Kerrys decision or recommendation on this issue. NYT: And then -- Ill let Jackie go -- but on the employer mandate, I dont think youve been asked the question directly why you made the decision to delay it, and whether, given your criticism of President Bush over the years for potentially exceeding his executive authority, theres been a lot of folks out there on the Republican side who claim that somehow youve exceeded your authority on this. Is there anything to that? MR. OBAMA: Well, this was a very practical decision that actually doesnt go to the heart of us implementing the Affordable Care Act. The majority of employers in this country provide health insurance to their employees. And the number of employers who are potentially subject to the employer mandate is relatively small. The way the law was originally written, it did not take into account the fact that we dont necessarily need to load up the vast majority of companies that are already doing the right thing with a bunch of additional paperwork; are there simpler ways for us to allow them to certify that theyre providing health insurance? And if they do that, then the purpose, the spirit of the law is met, and we can concentrate on the few bad actors who are unwilling to provide health insurance to their employees even though they can afford it, and theyre relatively large employers. Advertisement Continue reading the main story And businesses came to us and said, listen, we were supportive of providing health insurance to employees, in fact, we provide health insurance to our employees; we understand you want to get at the bad actors here, but are there ways to provide us some administrative relief? And what we said was, given that that is not critical to standing up the marketplaces where people are going to actually be able to buy lower-cost, high-quality insurance and get the tax credits that make it affordable for them, we thought it made sense to give another year not only for companies to prepare, but also for us to work with Treasury and others to see if there are just ways we can make this a little bit simpler for companies who are already doing the right thing. This is the kind of routine modifications or tweaks to a large program thats starting off that in normal times in a normal political atmosphere would draw a yawn from everybody. The fact that something like this generates a frenzy on Republicans is consistent with the fact that they've voted to repeal this thing 38 times without offering a alternative that is plausible. And from what I understand, based on recent reporting, theyve just given up on offering an alternative. So essentially -- their central economic plan that theyre currently presenting involves making sure that 50 million Americans cannot get health insurance; that people with preexisting conditions are potentially locked out of the market; that the rebates that people have received from insurance companies are sent back; that young people who are right now on their parents plan because theyre 26 or under, that they suddenly dont have health insurance. I do not understand the argument that that somehow grows the economy or strengthens the middle class. And during the course of implementation, are there going to be some glitches? Are there going to be some complaints from employers who are still trying to figure it out and may not know what subsidies are available to them? Absolutely. Are there some folks who may say, we're going to try to figure out ways not to provide health insurance to our employees? Yes. But thats a small proportion of our overall economy, and the principle that everybody should be able to get health insurance is one that the vast majority of Americans agree with. NYT: People questioned your legal and constitutional authority to do that unilaterally -- to delay the employer mandate. Did you consult with your lawyer? MR. OBAMA: Jackie, if you heard me on stage today, what I said was that I will seize any opportunity I can find to work with Congress to strengthen the middle class, improve their prospects, improve their security -- NYT: No, but specifically  MR. OBAMA: -- but where Congress is unwilling to act, I will take whatever administrative steps that I can in order to do right by the American people. And if Congress thinks that what Ive done is inappropriate or wrong in some fashion, theyre free to make that case. But theres not an action that I take that you don't have some folks in Congress who say that I'm usurping my authority. Some of those folks think I usurp my authority by having the gall to win the presidency. And I don't think that's a secret. But ultimately, Im not concerned about their opinions -- very few of them, by the way, are lawyers, much less constitutional lawyers. Advertisement Continue reading the main story I am concerned about the folks who I spoke to today who are working really hard, are trying to figure out how they can send their kids to college, are trying to make sure that they can save for their retirement. And if I can take steps on their behalf, then Im going to do so. And I would hope that more and more of Congress will say, you know what, since thats our primary focus, were willing to work with you to advance those ideals. But Im not just going to sit back if the only message from some of these folks is no on everything, and sit around and twiddle my thumbs for the next 1,200 days. NYT: Polls this week have shown your health care law has lost support. What are you going to be doing to build support? MR. OBAMA: Were going to implement it. NYT: Are you going to be getting out on the road? MR. OBAMA: Here is what will build support, given that weve been outspent four to one from the other side with all kinds of distortions about health care. Here is what were going to do to beat back that misinformation. On October 1st, people are going to be able to start signing up. And if right now theyre buying insurance on the individual market, theyre going to get on those computers or theyre going to make a phone call to one of these call centers and theyre going to find out that they can save 20 percent, 30 percent, or 50 percent on their premiums. And people who have not been able to get insurance before are going to be able to finally get insurance. And people who lose their jobs in the interim and find out that theyve got a preexisting condition, its hard for them to get insurance or they cant afford COBRA, theyre going to have a place to go. And over the course of six months to a year, as people sign up, and it works, and lo and behold, the people who already have health insurance are not being impacted at all other than the fact that their insurance is more secure and they are getting free preventive care, and all the nightmare scenarios and the train wrecks and the sky is falling predictions that come from the other side do not happen, then health care will become more popular. But until then, when were getting outspent four to one and people are just uncertain about what all this means for them, were going to continue to have some polls like that. And me just making more speeches explaining it in and of itself wont do it. The test of this is going to be is it working. And if it works, it will be pretty darn popular. NYT: March on Washington coming up soon. Are you going to do anything to mark it? Are you planning on being a part of the 50th anniversary? MR. OBAMA: Absolutely. Its obviously a historic, seminal event in the country. Its part of my generations formative memory and its a good time for us to do some reflection. Obviously, after the Trayvon Martin case, a lot of people have been thinking about race, but I always remind people -- and, in fact, I have a copy of the original program in my office, framed -- that that was a march for jobs and justice; that there was a massive economic component to that. When you think about the coalition that brought about civil rights, it wasnt just folks who believed in racial equality; it was people who believed in working folks having a fair shot. It was Walter Reuther and the UAW coming down here because they understood that if there are some workers who are not getting a fair deal then ultimately thats going to undercut their ability to get a fair deal. And if theres one thing that I wanted to try to emphasize today in this speech, it is that America has always worked better when everybody has a chance to succeed. Advertisement Continue reading the main story I had a conversation a couple of weeks back with a guy named Robert Putnam, who Ive known for a long time. NYT: He was my professor actually at Harvard. MR. OBAMA: Right. I actually knew Bob when I was a state senator and he had put together this seminar to just talk about some of the themes that he had written about in Bowling Alone, the weakening of the community fabric and the impact its having on people. And the work hes doing right now has to do with this issue of inequality. And it applies to a city like Galesburg, where 30 years ago, anybody in this town who wanted to find a job, they could go get a job. They could go get it at the Maytag plant. They could go get it with the railroad. It might be hard work, it might be tough work, but they could buy a house with it. The kids here all went to the same school -- the bankers kid and the guy working at the Maytag plants going to the same school. They've got the same social support. College is affordable for all of them. They don't have to take out $100,000 of debt to do it. And there was a sense of not upward mobility in the abstract; it was part and parcel of who we were as Americans. And thats whats been eroding over the last 20, 30 years, well before the financial crisis. Now, the financial crisis made things a lot worse. And so I had to spend the first four years in my presidency getting us back to ground level. We had to make sure the banking system wasn't collapsing. We had to make sure the auto industry didn't collapse. We had to make sure that we put people back to work short term and boosted demand until the markets got going and consumers got more confident and housing started to recover. And so here we are, having dealt with this massive crisis, but those trends -- that erosion of what a Galesburg or a [Port]* Clinton, Ohio, where Bob Putnam lived -- those trends have continued. And thats what people sense. That's why people are anxious. That's why people are frustrated. That's what they talk to me about and that's what they write to me about: I'm doing okay right now, but what I've seen over the last 20 years and what I learned profoundly during this crisis is that the ground under my feet just isn't as secure, and that the work I'm doing may not be rewarded. And everything that I am proposing and everything I will be proposing over the next three years goes right at that issue. And if thats not what Washingtons talking about, then we will be missing the boat. And racial tensions wont get better; they may get worse, because people will feel as if theyve got to compete with some other group to get scraps from a shrinking pot. If the economy is growing, everybody feels invested. Everybody feels as if we're rolling in the same direction. And so a lot of the other issues that were talking about -- whether its climate change or immigration, or how we manage our trade relations -- all those are eased if weve got our economic act together. But thats not what we talk about. And it's true that Congress moves at such a glacial pace these days that sometimes if you start a bill like immigration and you're thinking this should be done by now, it seems to take a year of folks just sitting around spinning their wheels, that can be frustrating. But we should be able to attend to some of these other issues even as were staying focused on this central issue. Thats at least what Im going to be doing.

21570,Remarks by the President on Increasing Oversight on Manipulation in Oil Markets,"Rose Garden 11:27 A.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT: Good morning, everybody. Lately, Ive been speaking a lot about our need for an all-of-the-above strategy for American energy -- a strategy that produces more oil and gas here at home, but also produces more biofuels and fuel-efficient cars, more solar power and wind power and other sources of clean, renewable energy. This strategy is not just the right thing to do for our long-term economic growth; its also the right way for us to reduce our dependence on foreign oil right now. Its the right way for us to put people to work right now. And ultimately, its the right way to stop spikes in gas prices that weve put up [with] every single year -- the same kind of increase that weve seen over the past couple of months. Obviously rising gas prices means a rough ride for a lot of families. Whether youre trying to get to school, trying to get to work, do some grocery shopping, you have to be able to fill up that gas tank. And there are families in certain parts of the country that have no choice but to drive 50 or 60 miles to get to the job. So when gas prices go up, its like an additional tax that comes right out of your pocket. Thats one of the reasons we passed a payroll tax cut at the beginning of this year and made sure it extended all the way through this year, so that the average American is getting that extra $40 in every paycheck right now. But I think everybody understands that there are no quick fixes to this problem. There are politicians who say that if we just drilled more then gas prices would come down right away. What they dont say is that we have been drilling more. Under my administration, America is producing more oil than at any time in the last eight years. Weve opened up new areas for exploration. We've quadrupled the number of operating rigs to a record high. We've added enough new oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth and then some. But as I've said repeatedly, the problem is we use more than 20 percent of the worlds oil and we only have 2 percent of the worlds proven oil reserves. Even if we drilled every square inch of this country right now, wed still have to rely disproportionately on other countries for their oil. That means we pay more at the pump every time theres instability in the Middle East, or growing demand in countries like China and India. Thats whats happening right now. Its those global trends that are affecting gas prices. So even as we're tackling issues of supply and demand, even as we're looking at the long-term in terms of how we can structurally make ourselves less reliant on foreign oil, we still need to work extra hard to protect consumers from factors that should not affect the price of a barrel of oil. That includes doing everything we can to ensure that an irresponsible few arent able to hurt consumers by illegally manipulating or rigging the energy markets for their own gain. We can't afford a situation where speculators artificially manipulate markets by buying up oil, creating the perception of a shortage, and driving prices higher -- only to flip the oil for a quick profit. We cant afford a situation where some speculators can reap millions, while millions of American families get the short end of the stick. Thats not the way the market should work. And for anyone who thinks this cannot happen, just think back to how Enron traders manipulated the price of electricity to reap huge profits at everybody elses expense. Now, the good news is my administration has already taken several actions to step up oversight of oil markets and close dangerous loopholes that were allowing some traders to operate in the shadows. We closed the so-called Enron loophole that let traders evade oversight by using electronic or overseas trading platforms. In the Wall Street reform law, we said for the first time that federal regulators will make sure no single trader can buy such a large position in oil that they could easily manipulate the market on their own. So Id point out that anybody whos pledging to roll back Wall Street reform -- Dodd-Frank -- would also roll back this vital consumer protection along with it. Ive asked Attorney General Holder to work with Chairman Leibowitz of the Federal Trade Commission, Chairman Gensler of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and other enforcement agencies to make sure that acts of manipulation, fraud or other illegal activity are not behind increases in the price that consumers pay at the pump. So today, were announcing new steps to strengthen oversight of energy markets. Things that we can do administratively, we are doing. And I call on Congress to pass a package of measures to crack down on illegal activity and hold accountable those who manipulate the market for private gain at the expense of millions of working families. And be specific. First, Congress should provide immediate funding to put more cops on the beat to monitor activity in energy markets. This funding would also upgrade technology so that our surveillance and enforcement officers arent hamstrung by older and less sophisticated tools than the ones that traders are using. We should strengthen protections for American consumers, not gut them. And these markets have expanded significantly. Chairman Gensler actually had a good analogy. He said, imagine if the NFL quadrupled the number of teams but didnt increase the number of refs. Youd end up having havoc on the field, and it would diminish the game. It wouldnt be fair. Thats part of whats going on in a lot of these markets. So we have to properly resource enforcement. Second, Congress should increase the civil and criminal penalties for illegal energy market manipulation and other illegal activities. So my plan would toughen key financial penalties tenfold, and impose these penalties not just per violation, but for every day a violation occurs. Third, Congress should give the agency responsible for overseeing oil markets new authority to protect against volatility and excess speculation by making sure that traders can post appropriate margins, which simply means that they actually have the money to make good on their trades. Congress should do all of this right away. A few weeks ago, Congress had a chance to stand up for families already paying an extra premium at the pump; congressional Republicans voted to keep spending billions of Americans' hard-earned tax dollars on more unnecessary subsidies for big oil companies. So here's a chance to make amends, a chance to actually do something that will protect consumers by increasing oversight of energy markets. That should be something that everybody, no matter their party, should agree with. And I hope Americans will ask their members of Congress to step up. In the meantime, my administration will take new executive actions to better analyze and investigate trading activities in energy markets and more quickly implement the tough consumer protections under Wall Street reform. Let me close by saying none of these steps by themselves will bring gas prices down overnight. But it will prevent market manipulation and make sure we're looking out for American consumers. And in the meantime we're going to keep pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy for American energy to break the cycle of price spikes year after year. We are going to keep producing more biofuels; we're going to keep producing more fuel-efficient cars; we are going to keep tapping into every source of American-made energy. And these steps have already helped put America on a path to greater energy independence. Our foreign -- our dependence on foreign oil has actually decreased each year I've been in office -- even as the economy has grown. America now imports less than half of the oil we use for the first time in more than a decade. So we are less vulnerable than we were, but we're still too vulnerable. We've got to continue the hard, sustained work on this issue. And as long as I'm President we're going to keep placing our bets on America's future -- America's workers, America's technology, America's ingenuity, and American-made energy. That's how we're going to solve this problem once and for all. Thank you very much, everybody. END 11:35 A.M.

21920,The Gingrich Tragedy,"Though his ideas stray, his most common theme is that government should intervene in crucial ways to create a dynamic, decentralized, low- tax society. So why am I not more excited by the Gingrich surge? In the first place, Gingrich loves government more than I do. He has no Hayekian modesty to restrain his faith in statist endeavor. For example, he has called for a massive new program to build a permanent lunar colony to exploit the Moons resources. He has suggested that a mirror system in space could provide the light equivalent of many full moons so that there would be no need for nighttime lighting of the highways. Photo Im for national greatness conservatism, but this is a little too great. Furthermore, he has an unconservative faith in his own innocence. The crossroads where government meets enterprise can be an exciting crossroads. It can also be a corrupt crossroads. It requires moral rectitude to separate public service from private gain. Gingrich was perfectly content to belly up to the Freddie Mac trough and then invent a Hamiltonian rationale to justify his own greed. Then there is his rhetorical style. He seems to have understood that a moderate Republican like himself can win so long as he adopts a bombastic style when taking on the liberal elites. Most people just want somebody who can articulate their hatreds, and Gingrich is demagogically happy to play the role.

View all New York Times newsletters. Most important, there is temperament and character. As Yuval Levin noted in a post for National Review, the two Republican front-runners, Gingrich and Mitt Romney are both very wonky Rockefeller Republicans who moved to the right over time as their party moved right. But they have very different temperaments. Romney, Levin observes, has an executive temperament  organization, discipline, calm and restraint. Gingrich has a revolutionary temperament  intensity, energy, disorganization and a tendency to see everything as a cataclysmic clash requiring a radical response. Id make a slightly similar point more rudely. In the two main Republican contenders, we have one man, Romney, who seems to have walked straight out of the 1950s, and another, Gingrich, who seems to have walked straight out of the 1960s. He has every negative character trait that conservatives associate with 60s excess: narcissism, self-righteousness, self-indulgence and intemperance. He just has those traits in Republican form. As nearly everyone who has ever worked with him knows, he would severely damage conservatism and the Republican Party if nominated. He would severely damage the Hamilton- Theodore Roosevelt strain in American life. Its really too bad. We could have had a great debate about the progressive-conservative tradition. President Obama is now embracing Roosevelt. Gingrich has tried to modernize this tendency.

22191,"Tim Pawlenty press-palooza. Prez candidate barnstorms FL, explains record","From gay marriage to global warming to immigration and taxes, Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty doesn't flinch from a chance to sit down and answer questions about his record and his candidacy (unlike many candidates). Pawlenty sat down yesterday afternoon with the St. Petersburg Times on camera and then after a day of fundraising, did the same with the Miami Herald. Here's a partial transcript: Q: Youre racking up endorsements from top Florida legislators, but stuck at the bottom of the polls. Why? Pawlenty: The early days of campaigning in a state like Florida are retail..Early polls dont predict anything, ultimately. If they did, Hillary Clinton or Rudy Giuliani would be president today. National polls basically always misinterpret the final outcome or mis-predict the final outcome. Q: Explain Floridas role in your campaign and the election? Pawlenty: Florida plays a pivotal role not just in the general election, but more often than not in the primary. This can be kind of the state where the putative nominee is selected. So we take that very seriously. Q: What do you think of the debt ceiling? Pawlenty: The debt ceiling agreement was really disappointing. This is an agreement that doesnt really fix the problem.But they didnt really fix the underlying structural problem of the country. Q: Are you letting the perfect become the enemy of the good? Why not accept something mediocre? Pawlenty: I dont think underwhelming or disappointing or mediocre or below average or flat-out pathetic is good enough for America anymore. We are in deep trouble. And the standard shouldnt be: What are those things that we can do that are mediocre, disappointing, underwhelming, uninspiring or lacking in courage? The standard should be: What can we do to continue this country to be the greatest country on the face of the earth. We should have a president whos leading the debate on these issues? And instead hes hiding, hes ducking, hes bobbing, hes weaving. You cant even find him on the major financial issues of our day. How he would reform Social Security. How he would reform Medicare. How he would reform Medicaid and so on. ""Most of the things that theyve now promised are in the future. Theyre contingent upon future action. And guess what? A future president and a future Congress could undo or duck all of those as well."" Q: What would you do with Social Security? Pawlenty: If youre on the program now or anywhere near eligibility, you shouldnt have your benefits impacted. But if youre in the next generation, were telling you now with several decades of warning, were going to gradually raise the retirement age over time. If youre lower income or middle income, you should still get your cost-of-living adjustment. But in the future, if youre real wealthy, were going to have to slow that down or take it away. Thats the way it is. This thing is drowning. And what people dont realize, if we dont make these kinds of changes, in current law, Social Security gets automatic cuts for everybody. So anybody whos in favor of doing nothing is in favor of cutting Social Security. And there are similar answers for Medicaid and Medicare. Q: Some of the increased spending happened in the Bush years, when two wars, a new Medicare prescription drug entitlement program and tax cuts were approved. Why not scale back all of that, including the tax cuts? Pawlenty: You have to look back at what got is into the mess. And, again, revenues kept up with the private economy. Its the government spending that went way beyond that While its fair to say that parties in Congress and both parties in the White House contributed to this problem, its also absolutely true that President Obama has made it exponentially worse. When President Bush left office, the deficit was approximately $500 billion. It is now approximately now $1.5 trillion. In other words, president Obama has essentially tripled the deficit. To make matters worse, he promised in the first few months of his presidency, that he would cut the deficit in half during his first term, which has turned out to be a broken promise. Q: Part of the Obama deficit was the stimulus, but a number of Republican governors such as yourself both bashed it and took the money at the same time. How do you explain that? Pawlenty: Theres a lot of reasons for it. If the federal government is dumb enough to give it to us, well be smart enough to take it. In Minnesotas case, we are not a net taker of money from the federal government. According to the Tax Foundation, for every dollar Minnesota sends to the federal government, we get approximately 73 cents back. We more than pay for our share of federal spending. Q: The Club for Growth gave you credit for stopping more than $7 billion in proposed tax increases and for holding down spending from a liberal legislature, but it expressed concern about what it called your nanny-state solution to cut down on smoking and fund public healthcare by hiking taxes on cigarettes. Can you explain?",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/14/tim-pawlenty/do-scientists-disagree-about-global-warming/,Science,Polifact
22354,"Commerce nominee appears to endorse world government in video, Republicans say","Does John Bryson, Barack Obamas nominee for commerce secretary, want a world government? Critics say a newly uncovered video of the nominee suggests that he does. In the video  given to The Daily Caller by sources on Capitol Hill  Bryson refers to the 2009 United Nations climate negotiations in Copenhagen as the closest thing we have to a world governance organization, implying it provided the best model for imposing climate regulations on countries around the globe. Bryson also boasts about his role as an adviser to the U.N. secretary general on climate change in the video. Brysons nomination has already run into problems stemming from his involvement in the founding of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a liberal environmental group, during the 1970s. Critics say Brysons advocacy of cap and trade, among other environmental regulations, is at odds with the pro-business mission of the Commerce Department. This video adds to the controversy. Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe, the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Commerce Committee, has denounced Bryson for favoring what the senator calls the administrations job-killing agenda. California Rep. Darrell Issa, who chairs the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, has attacked Bryson for being a green evangelist. The nominees remarks seem to imply he longs for a more powerful U.N. that can impose its will in addressing climate change, according to Colin Hanna, president of Let Freedom Ring. Brysons willingness to cede American sovereignty over domestic energy production to the United Nations may be a disqualifier for him to serve as secretary of commerce, said Brian Darling, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation who watched the video. Bryson should be asked to explain his comments and where the United Nations derives the authority to force the United States into U.N.-approved regulations on U.S. energy producers. Constitutional conservatives do not believe that the United Nations has the authority under the US Constitution to mandate any changes to U.S. policy and if Bryson was advocating for this, then Senators should take that important factor into consideration during the confirmation process of Bryson. Other conservative critics note that the secretary of commerces role is to promote trade around the globe and say Brysons comments seem to place his commitment to that role in doubt. The point is that his views on global government and on global governance, and on climate change are diametrically opposed to goals of the commerce secretary, said Hanna. His job is to increase exports, reduce unemployment, provide jobs and help the US economy. But Brysons advocacy of global carbon emissions standards would accomplish the exact opposite, according to Hanna. If we followed the standards of Copenhagen, we would have decreased exports, increased unemployment and a loss of global competitiveness, Hanna said. He is wrong on just about every metric by which a commerce secretary is judged. However, Myron Ebell, director of energy and climate change at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, told TheDC the video was not much of a smoking gun. While Ebell believes conservatives and libertarians have a lot to be concerned about regarding Brysons nomination, latching onto his comments in the video are a bit of stretch. Bryson has received the backing of the New York Times editorial page, which lauded his distinguished career as a businessman, public servant and environmentalist and called him the right businessman-environmentalist for the job in a June 5 column. The nominees background as CEO of Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison, does not imply that he has an understanding of competitive business because utilities are quasi-governmental monopolies that would benefit from higher electricity prices stemming from cap and trade, according to Ebell.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/09/gop-critics/anonymous-gop-officials-claim-commerce-nominee-joh/,Science,Polifact
22580,Shifts to and from Daylight Saving Time and Incidence of Myocardial Infarction,"To the Editor: More than 1.5 billion men and women are exposed to the transitions involved in daylight saving time: turning clocks forward by an hour in the spring and backward by an hour in the autumn. These transitions can disrupt chronobiologic rhythms and influence the duration and quality of sleep, and the effect lasts for several days after the shifts.1,2 We examined the influence of these transitions on the incidence of acute myocardial infarction. To calculate the incidence ratio, we compared the incidence of acute myocardial infarction during each of the first 7 days after the spring or autumn transition and the mean of the incidences on the corresponding weekdays 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after the day of interest. For example, for the Tuesday after the transition, we would have divided the incidence on that Tuesday by the mean of the incidence on the Tuesday 2 weeks earlier and the incidence on the Tuesday 2 weeks later. We used data from the Swedish registry of acute myocardial infarction, which provides high-quality information on all acute myocardial infarctions in the country since 1987. The incidence ratios, as measures of relative risk, and exact 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Figure 1. Figure 1. Incidence Ratios of Acute Myocardial Infarction on the First 7 Days after the Spring and Autumn Clock Shifts for Daylight Saving Time. The incidence is represented by the ratio of the number of acute myocardial infarctions (as the main diagnosis) on the given day after the shift to the mean number on the corresponding days 2 weeks earlier and 2 weeks later (both numbers given above the bars). Analyses of the data for the spring shift are based on the 15 years between 1987 and 2006 in which Easter Sunday was not the transition day (Panel A). Analyses of the data for the autumn shift are based on all 20 years between 1987 and 2006 (Panel B). In the autumn (Panel B), the control period was defined as the corresponding weekdays 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after the day of interest. In spring (Panel A), we aimed to avoid interference with Easter, the only public holiday that could influence our results. For years in which Easter Sunday was celebrated 2 weeks after the Sunday of the spring shift, we defined the control period for the Sunday of the shift as the Sunday 3 weeks before and the Sunday 3 weeks after (thus skipping Easter Sunday). When we did not exclude Easter if it coincided with the exposure or control days, we observed an even higher effect size associated with the spring transition. The number of acute myocardial infarctions on the transition Sunday was adjusted for the difference in day length as compared with the control Sundays (i.e., 23 vs. 24 hours in the spring [Panel A] and 25 vs. 24 hours in the autumn [Panel B]). The results of secondary analyses for both spring and autumn, which included acute myocardial infarctions that were either the main or secondary diagnoses, were essentially similar to the results of the analyses that included main diagnoses alone, as were the results of analyses of the spring shift that were restricted to fatal cases. For the autumn shift, in contrast to the analyses of all acute myocardial infarctions, analyses restricted to fatal cases showed a smaller decrease in the incidence of acute myocardial infarction on Monday, and the risk of fatal acute myocardial infarction increased during the first week after the shift. I bars denote 95% confidence intervals. The incidence of acute myocardial infarction was significantly increased for the first 3 weekdays after the transition to daylight saving time in the spring (Figure 1A). The incidence ratio for the first week after the spring shift, calculated as the incidence for all 7 days divided by the mean of the weekly incidences 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after, was 1.051 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.032 to 1.071). In contrast, after the transition out of daylight saving time in the autumn, only the first weekday was affected significantly (Figure 1B); the incidence ratio for the whole week was 0.985 (95% CI, 0.969 to 1.002). The effect of the spring transition to daylight saving time on the incidence of acute myocardial infarction was somewhat more pronounced in women than in men, and the autumn effect was more pronounced in men than in women. The separate analyses of the 19871996 and 19972006 periods yielded essentially the same results as those for the whole 19872006 period. The effects of transitions were consistently more pronounced for people under 65 years of age than for those 65 years of age or older. The most plausible explanation for our findings is the adverse effect of sleep deprivation on cardiovascular health. According to experimental studies, this adverse effect includes the predominance of sympathetic activity and an increase in proinflammatory cytokine levels.3,4 Our data suggest that vulnerable people might benefit from avoiding sudden changes in their biologic rhythms. It has been postulated that people in Western societies are chronically sleep deprived, since the average sleep duration decreased from 9.0 to 7.5 hours during the 20th century.4 Therefore, it is important to examine whether we can achieve beneficial effects with prolonged sleep. The finding that the possibility of additional sleep seems to be protective on the first workday after the autumn shift is intriguing. Monday is the day of the week associated with the highest risk of acute myocardial infarction, with the mental stress of starting a new workweek and the increase in activity suggested as an explanation.5 Our results raise the possibility that there is another, sleep-related component in the excess incidence of acute myocardial infarction on Monday. Sleep-diary studies suggest that bedtimes and wake-up times are usually later on weekend days than on weekdays; the earlier wake-up times on the first workday of the week and the consequent minor sleep deprivation can be hypothesized to have an adverse cardiovascular effect in some people. This effect would be less pronounced with the transition out of daylight saving time, since it allows for additional sleep. Studies are warranted to examine the possibility that a more stable weekly pattern of waking up in the morning and going to sleep at night or a somewhat later wake-up time on Monday might prevent some acute myocardial infarctions.

22958,"Loughlin on taxes, Boehner, climate change + more","Loughlin on taxes, Boehner, climate change + more As previously noted, John Loughlin wasted little time in planning the launch of his general election campaign against David Cicilline. The Republican made his entrance by carrying his podium to a sunny spot in front of the state Department of Administration. Press interest was strong. (And Loughlin already has another news conference, on small business, set for tomorrow). Heres the short form of the tax issue, the ostensible reason for the newser: Loughlin says he will not vote to raise taxes on any Rhode Islander, and he wants to continue the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts that are due to expire next year. (In response to my question, he says he doesnt call them the Bush tax cuts since Congress had a role in passing them.) (Cicilline campaign manager Eric Hyers says the Democratic CD1 candidate opposes any tax hikes for hard-working middle-class Rhode Islanders, but opposes Bush-era tax breaks for individuals earning more than $250,000.) Some related highlights from Loughlins press event: Jim Baron from the Times of Pawtucket asked Loughlin about his statement that Cicilline would be a rubber stamp for Nancy Pelosi. So, Baron wondered, would the Tiverton Republican be a rubber stamp for John Boehner? I would answer that, Jim, by saying, just take a look at the record; Have I been a rubber stamp for Governor Carcieris agenda? Ive always been an independent thinker  thats the hallmark of my time in the General Assembly, and it certainly will be the hallmark of my time in Washington. Loughlin was a little cute slightly dodging questions about national Republican interest in helping him (Tim White has more on this topic, following up on a question raised here). Loughlin said hed welcome assistance, of course. The NRCC [National Republican Congressional Committee] has not made a contribution to my campaign, to my knowledge, theyve havent made a contribution to anybodys at this point. Steve Klamkin from WPRO asked what kind of campaign the Republican expects and hopes for with Cicilline: You know, Im not going to try to war-game what my opponents campaign will be. I will tell you that my campaign is and continues to be issues-based. Sean Daly of Channel 12 queried on the Scott Brown comparisons: Hes a lot taller than I was, for one thing, and his truck was newer [Loughlin drives a pickup]. I mean, uh, everybody likes to draw comparisons to other races. I think that this race is unique. Keep in mind that I had entered this race before anyone had even heard of Scott Brown. Michelle Smith of the AP asked about Loughlins views on climate change: I think that there is, in fact, climate change. I think the data is unclear as to the extent of man-caused climate change. When you look at the total percentage of greenhouse gas emissions, a good number of them  in fact, the vast majority  are naturally occuring. Certainly, the data that has come out lately has cast some cold water on those who have adopted climate change, man-caused climate change, as a religion, and I think that we need to take a much, much closer look at real actual data to make sure, in fact, were not creating more of a problem by thinking we have more of an influence than we do. I worked for the space program, for example. And in 1976, we put a lander on Mars, and from 1976 to the present day, surface temperatures on the surface of Mars have risen.

23436,"Dont Use Gulf Crisis to Raid Trust Fund, Force BP-Endorsed National Energy Tax","WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following remarks on the Senate floor Wednesday regarding Democrat efforts to use the oil spill liability trust fund to pay for new, unrelated spending: Our nation faces many urgent crises at the moment. Americans are looking for solutions. Theyre not getting any from Washington. Whether its the housing crisis, the financial crisis, the debt crisis, or the crisis in the Gulf, what theyre getting is a White House and a Democrat majority in Congress that seems more intent on pursuing a government-driven political agenda than in finding common-sense solutions to the problems that ail us. Americans are exasperated by all this, but they shouldnt be surprised  because if theres one motto that defines this administration, it the one that was delivered by the White House chief of staff in a revealing moment just after the Presidents election. Im referring, of course, to what Mr. Emanuel famously referred to as Rule One: Never allow a crisis go to waste. Its a fitting slogan for an administration that saw a crisis at some of Americas great auto-making firms as an opportunity for government to extend its reach into industrial policy; which saw the panic on Wall Street as an opportunity for government to extend its reach further into Main Street; which saw out-of-control costs in health care as an opportunity to extend governments reach further into the health care decisions of every American; and which is now talking about using a nightmarish environmental calamity in the Gulf as a prime opportunity to extend governments reach even further into Americans lives through a new job-killing national energy tax that would hit every single household and business, small or large, in America. Think about it: for more than fifty straight days, an underwater geyser of oil now roughly the size of Vermont has been polluting the Gulf. This is the kind of crisis that in the past would have united the nation in a focused effort to solve the problem. And yet day after day, as this toxic oil continues to flow, what we get from the administration is some new twist on the blame game or some ham-handed effort to appear in control of the situation. Meanwhile, here in Congress, were getting much the same thing: the deficit Extenders Bill thats now on the floor was supposed to be about giving job creators some assurance that the tax benefits theyre currently receiving, and which they depend on to retain workers will be there the next time they have to make a major business-related decision. Yet Democrats are using this bill as another opportunity to extend governments reach. Desperate for funds to bail out government programs, theyre raiding a trust fund that was created  get this  to pay for just the kind of cleanup we now need in the Gulf. Theyre quintupling the tax oil companies pay into the oil spill liability trust fund that was created in the wake of Exxon Valdez, and instead of using this money to clean up the oil spewing in the Gulf, theyre raiding the trust fund to pay for new, unrelated spending. In other words, theyre using the crisis in the Gulf not only as cover for even more government spending, but as a major source of funding for it. This is an outrage. And it should give every American a window into the Democrat approach to spending as well as their lack of seriousness about the debt; they just cant restrain themselves. Thats the only possible excuse for raiding this trust fund for unrelated government spending. At the same time, as Americans wonder when this gusher will ever be plugged, we hear word that the administration and the Majority Leader want to piggyback their controversial new national energy tax  also known as cap-and-trade, to an oil spill response bill that could and should be an opportunity for true bipartisan cooperation. So here again, we see the administration using a crisis, in this case the disaster in the Gulf, as an opportunity to muscle through Congress another deeply unpopular bill that has profound implications for small business and struggling households. Look: if the health care debate taught us anything, its that Americans want these kinds of massive bills debated out in the open  not rushed past them on a holiday or tacked onto a must-pass bill aimed at alleviating the kind of suffering were seeing in the Gulf. The problem for Democrats is that debating the Democrat cap-and-trade bill might not fit neatly into the White House messaging plan, since its been widely reported that a major part of the Kerry-Lieberman bill was essentially written by BP. This is clearly an inconvenient fact: an administration that seems to spend most of its time coming up with new ways to show how angry it is with BP is pushing a proposal that BP helped write. I cant understand, and I dont think the American people will understand, why the Majority believes that it make sense to respond to the BP oil spill by imposing a gas tax increase on the American people that was advocated by  BP. I think the American people want us to work together to address the disaster in the Gulf, not exploit it for partisan political purposes. The oil spill trust fund ought to be used to clean up oil spills. This is one crisis that Americans wont let Democrats exploit for their policy purposes ###",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/14/mitch-mcconnell/mcconnell-says-kerry-lieberman-climate-bill-essent/,Science,Polifact
132,The Honey Chrome extension: An example of what's new and better,"To paraphrase the Most Interesting Man in the World, I don't always bring coupons to the store, but when I do I usually forget to apply them when checking out. I've resorted to wrapping the coupon around my credit card so I'll remember it. Online shopping is much the same experience for me. I usually skip over coupon code fields since I don't receive coupons by email and searching the web for them is too much trouble when I need that anniversary gift shipped out NOW. Sign up for TechRepublic's Google in the Enterprise newsletter! Subscribe The benefit of Honey Figure A Because of my chronic lack of coupon awareness, I was interested to read about Honey , a Chrome extension which can do the coupon-hunting for you. Honey adds a ""Find savings"" button () to many prominent sites (Amazon.com, Old Navy, Best Buy, etc.) which you can use at checkout. Any relevant or applicable coupons can then be applied to your order. Their main site has a FAQ with the full rundown. I have to admit a part of me was skeptical. As a system administrator I spent many horrible years dealing with spyware on computer systems at work and home, fixing suffocated PCs for fellow employees, friends, and family alike. Though the spyware heyday seems to be waning fast (thankfully), I still grimace in disgust at the memory of Bargain Buddy, CoolWebSearch, Gator, and similar ilk which caused me to pull out my hair in frustration and reach for the Advil. Years in the trenches conditioned a deep and healthy skepticism in me towards anything I need to install to obtain ""offers,"" ""savings,"" ""deals,"" etc. However, this is a new era. I kept an open mind and was pleased to see that Honey does what it's supposed to without any gimmicks, tricks or ulterior motives. I tested this extension to see how it affected my system (see ""Are you sure it's not spyware?"" below for details) to confirm that it had no adverse impact. Installing Honey At present Honey only runs on Chrome, but extensions for other browsers are in the works. Figure B To install Honey in Chrome, access www.joinhoney.com .

372,Jealousy in Dogs,"It is commonly assumed that jealousy is unique to humans, partially because of the complex cognitions often involved in this emotion. However, from a functional perspective, one might expect that an emotion that evolved to protect social bonds from interlopers might exist in other social species, particularly one as cognitively sophisticated as the dog. The current experiment adapted a paradigm from human infant studies to examine jealousy in domestic dogs. We found that dogs exhibited significantly more jealous behaviors (e.g., snapping, getting between the owner and object, pushing/touching the object/owner) when their owners displayed affectionate behaviors towards what appeared to be another dog as compared to nonsocial objects. These results lend support to the hypothesis that jealousy has some primordial form that exists in human infants and in at least one other social species besides humans. As discussed earlier, the proposed function of jealousy is to break-up a potentially threatening liaison and protect the primary relationship. This motivates several types of behaviors including approach actions such as attempts to get physically or psychologically between the attachment 3ure and the interloper, attending to the threatening interaction, seeking attention from the attachment figure, as well as indicators of negative emotion such as aggression, particularly toward the interloper [1]  [2] , [8] , [10]  [12] , [19] . Across social species, we would expect to see similar types of behaviors that serve the function of this motivational state. Therefore, the specific behaviors assessed in our experiment were based on studies of jealousy in non-verbal human infants and adults as well as behaviors described by dog owners and experts as indicative of jealousy. To evaluate dogs' jealous behaviors, we modified a paradigm used to assess jealousy in 6-month-old infants [10]  [12] . Thirty-six dogs were individually tested and videotaped while their owners ignored them and interacted with a series of three different objects. In the jealousy condition, the owner treated a stuffed dog, which briefly barked and wagged its tail, as if it were a real dog (e.g., petting, talking sweetly). In another condition, owners engaged in these same behaviors but did so towards a novel object (jack-o-lantern pail). This enabled us to test whether the elicitation of jealousy required that the owner show affection to an appropriate stimulus (what appeared to be a conspecific) or whether affectionate behaviors directed to a nonsocial stimulus would be enough to arouse jealous behaviors. In the third condition, the owner read aloud a children's book, which had pop-up pages and played melodies. This condition allowed us to test whether dogs' behaviors in the other conditions were indicative of jealousy per se (arising over the loss of affection and attention towards an interloper) or more general negative affect due to the loss of the owner's attention. Although there are several reasons to predict that jealousy should lie within a dog's emotional repertoire, empirical evidence is lacking. The purpose of the present study was to construct a social situation and determine whether dogs, whose owners show affection to a potential interloper, engage in behaviors indicative of jealousy. The idea that dogs are capable of jealousy is congenial to the burgeoning body of research on animal social cognition that reveals that dogs have sophisticated social-cognitive abilities. For example, dogs can use a variety of human communicative signals (e.g., pointing, eye gaze) to determine the location of hidden food [16] , are better at using social cues than chimpanzees [16] , show some sensitivity to reward inequity when a partner is rewarded and they are not [17] and appear aware of, and actively attempt to manipulate, the visual attention of their play partners [18] . The functional account we are proposing would further predict that jealousy should occur not only in humans, but also in other social species in which emotional bonds between individuals develop and can be threatened by third parties. Interestingly, several observers of animal behavior, including Charles Darwin [13] , have suggested that jealousy may exist in other species, particularly in dogs. This possibility has also been underscored in a recent paper that had owners recount specific cases of their animals displaying emotions [14] . Descriptions of dog jealousy were fairly consistent across owners and always involved a social triangle. When the owners gave attention and affection to another person or animal, the dogs seemed to engage in attention-seeking behaviors (pushing against the owner or in between the owner and the rival, barking/growling/whining) and some showed aggression. Reports of the occurrence of jealousy in dogs was at least as common, if not more so, than some other emotions that are often considered more primary (anxiety and anger). However, despite such reports, experimental evidence demonstrating behavioral indices of jealousy in dogs does not exist. This type of empirical research seems particularly important, given that dog owners also report that their animals experience guilt but experimental work raises some doubt about whether dogs do show guilt [15] . The theory that jealousy can take a primordial form finds support from the small but emerging body of research on human infant jealousy. Several studies [10]  [12] found that infants as young as 6-months of age show behaviors indicative of jealousy, for example, when their mothers interacted with what appeared to be another infant (but was actually a realistic looking doll). The infants did not display the same behaviors when their mothers attend to a nonsocial item (a book). One possibility is that jealousy first evolved in the context of sibling-parent relationships where dependent offspring compete for parental resources. An implication of this hypothesis is that jealousy may have a primordial or core form that can be triggered without complex cognition about the self or about the meaning of the social interaction [1] , [9] . This primordial form of jealousy may be elicited by the relatively simple perception that an attachment figure or loved one's attention has been captured by a potential usurper, which suffices to elicit a motive to regain the loved one's attention and block the liaison. Primordial jealousy may serve as the building block for jealousy elicited by more complex cognitive processes. For example, in adult human relationships, the experience of jealousy is greatly impacted by additional appraisals about the meaning of the interaction (e.g., does this mean my mate will leave me? Am I unloveable?). In both primordial and complex cases of jealousy, there is a motivation to restore the relationship and remove the usurper. However, in the latter case, interpretations of the situation play a large role in the elicitation and experience of the emotion. The vast majority of research in this area has concentrated on jealousy within romantic relationships particularly over potential or actual infidelity. Hence, functional or evolutionary analysis of jealousy has focused on the fitness consequences of loss of a romantic or sexual relationship (e.g., cuckoldry, loss of resources) and on the psychological and behavioral effects of protecting such relationships [5]  [7] . A broader functional view, however, would argue that jealousy evolved to secure resources not just in the context of sexual relationships, but also in any of a wide-range of valued relationships [1] , [8] . Accordingly, the same underlying emotional process that gives rise to jealousy in sexual relationships also produces jealousy in other types of bonds (e.g., friendships). In humans, jealousy is an emotion with far-reaching psychological and social consequences. For example, it typically emerges as the third leading cause of non-accidental homicide across cultures [1] . While the origins and possible function of jealousy have been debated, most theorists agree on one defining feature: It requires a social triangle, arising when an interloper threatens an important relationship. A common assumption has been that the elicitation of jealousy involves, and perhaps requires, complex cognitive abilities [2]  [3] , including appraisals about the meaning of the rival threat to one's self (e.g., self-esteem) and to one's relationship. For example, Lewis [4] has proposed that the emergence of jealousy requires the cognitive ability to reflect on the self and to understand conscious intentions. In addition to assessing jealousy, we used this opportunity to explore attachment style in dogs (and its possible interaction with our conditions), which we mention here for the sake of completeness. We created a scale for owners to complete regarding their dog's attachment style and coded for behaviors that might be linked to different attachment styles. These included behaviors that might be indicative of anxiety (paw slightly raised; yawning) and of submission (ears back, tail down, and licking). We also attempted to code tail wagging to the left vs. the right because work by Quaranta, Siniscalchi, and Vallortigara [20] suggested that the former is associated with withdrawal and the latter with approach. However, our coders found this too difficult to assess via video. Analyses pertaining to attachment style are not reported here given their exploratory nature and the difficulty of measuring some of these behaviors. During the post-interaction period, the owner put the object down and walked away. We coded four behaviors during this phase: 1) aggression/snapping directed at the object; 2) following the owner; 3) observing the object; and 4) ignoring the object. Due to the laborious nature of coding, we only coded for presence/absence of attention behaviors (observing/ignoring object) in this phase rather than assessing attention every 5 seconds as done in the condition phase. Additionally, in the dog condition, we noted if the dog sniffed the rear end of the toy dog. This was included as a measure of whether the dog perceived the stuffed dog as a real dog. The preverbal human infant literature (e.g., by Hart and colleagues) suggests that jealousy produces increased interest and attention toward the mother. We assessed several behaviors pertaining to attention, which included 1) looking at the owner, 2) looking at the rival object, 3) orienting away from the owner, and 4) orienting away from the object. The first two categories were operationally defined as having the head turned and gaze directed toward the owner/object; the later two were operationally defined as having the head and body turned away from the owner/object. Due to their frequency across conditions, a simple present/absent code for the entire interaction period did not adequately capture these behaviors. Therefore, we performed more fined grained coding that consisted of denoting whether the behavior was present or absent every 5 seconds, resulting in total score that ranged from 012. Total scores were then transformed into proportion of time behavior was present. (In the cases where both raters coded the same dog's behavior, the average of the two coders' scores was used for these measures.) The most common category of behavior in owner descriptions of their dogs' jealousy was attention seeking [14] . These behaviors often took the form of pushing the owner or attempting to get between the owner and the rival. We coded for both of these behaviors. Some owners also reported attempts by their dogs to shoo the rival away. In our coding scheme, we operationalized this as the dog pushing against the rival object. Another class of behaviors categorized as attention seeking by Morris et al. [14] was vocalizations (described as barking, growling, and whining), which we assessed. (Growling interrater reliability was lower than our .7 cutoff so was excluded from our analyses.) We coded for aggression given its link to jealousy in human adults [1] and in owners' reports of dog jealousy [14] . Our primary measure of aggression was whether the dog attempted to bite/snap at the object. Coders also attempted to code more subtle signs of aggression that include lip curling (lips being held open with force in order to expose teeth), raised tailholding the tail up between the horizontal and vertical positions (an aggressive posture in wolves), and keeping the ears forward. Interrater reliability was low for ears forward (.57) and so this behavior was not analyzed. Our coders also reported difficulty assessing the raised tail in many dogs due to their physical characteristics (e.g., a clipped tail); however, interrater reliability was acceptable, so these analyses are reported in the results section. Lip curling was not seen across any condition. Two raters, blind to the study's purpose, coded the videos. Unless otherwise noted, behaviors were coded as present or absent and are reported as percent of dogs showing such behaviors per condition. To compute interrater reliability, 29 dogs were coded by both raters. Behaviors in which interrater reliability was lower than .7 were not included in the analyses. For analyses that required whole numbers (i.e., Cochran's Test for presence/absence of a behavior), we used one rater's codes for half the dogs and the other rater's codes for the other half. Behaviors coded during the interaction of the owner with the object are described first, followed by the behaviors coded post-interaction. In the book control condition, owners were instructed to read aloud a children's book, which popped up and played melodies, as if they were reading to a young child. Total amount of time the object made a noise was closely matched to that of the dog condition (approximately 8 secs). Owners were instructed to interact with a realistic-looking stuffed dog that barked, whined, and wagged its tail (which lasted for a total of approximately 8 secs) when a button on the top of its head was pressed. The owners were asked to press the button only once and to interact with the stuffed dog as if they were playing with a real dog. They were also instructed to completely ignore their dog, which was present in the room for the duration of the interaction. Owners were not aware of the hypotheses of the experiment. A within-subjects design was employed with order counter-balanced across participants. Each experimental condition was videotaped and lasted for 1 minute, followed by a 30 sec post-condition phase in which the owner set the object down within reach of the dog. The owner completed a questionnaire after each condition and then the dog and owner were given one minute to freely interact in order to reduce any potential carryover effects from the previous condition. The initial sample size was n = 37. However, one male dog was excluded from all analyses due to a miscommunication between the owner and experimenter resulting in one condition ending prematurely. Therefore, the final sample size was n = 36. The mean age of the dogs was 32.2 months (range = 4135). Equal numbers of male and female dogs participated. The sample consisted of a variety of dog breeds as can be seen in Table 1 . Owners (31 females and 5 males) had owned their dogs an average of 25.4 months (range = 1134). Dogs were tested individually at their homes and had to be less than 35 pounds or shorter than 15 inches. A size criterion was used because of the possibility that the jealousy manipulation would result in aggression and small dogs could be more easily controlled in such circumstances. Upon arrival at the subjects' homes, the experimenter obtained written consent from the dog owners for participation. The experimenter also gave a brief overview of the study stating, For this experiment, we are examining individual differences in dog behavior across various situations. Thus, we'll be asking you to act out various situations in front of your dog, while ignoring him or her, while we film his or her reaction."" The experimenter also said, ""If you think that your dog will act aggressively in this situation, we ask that you and your dog don't participate, but you'll still receive your Experimetrix [course] credit."" All owners chose to continue with the experiment. This research was approved by the University of California San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and by the University of California at San Diego Human Research Protections Program. Owners and pet dogs were recruited from the University of California, San Diego subject pool. Owners received partial course credit in psychology class for participation. Results & Discussion Figure 1 shows the proportion of dogs that engaged in the various behaviors during the interactions with the objects in each condition. Our analyses showed significantly greater aggression in the jealousy condition, Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = 12.80, p< .002. One fourth of the dogs snapped at the object in the jealousy condition but only 1 dog did so in the other two conditions. (Results from follow up McNemar nonparametric tests are presented in Figure 1.) We, however, did not see a difference across conditions in the number of dogs that placed their tails between the vertical and horizontal positions (Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = .67, ns). This may be due to our coders having difficulty accurately assessing tail movement (e.g., in dogs with snipped tails). In the post-interaction phase (when the owner had put the object down), 36% of the dogs snapped at the stuffed dog while snapping behavior in the other conditions was confined to one dog (Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = 20.57, p< .001). The aggression in the jealousy condition is particularly impressive given that we only tested dogs whose owners believed that their dogs would not behave aggressively in novel situations. The next series of analyses examined attention seeking and specifically focused on the behaviors most commonly noted by owners when describing their animals' jealous behaviors [14]. Dogs were significantly more likely to push or touch their owners (Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = 26.87, p< .001) and the object (Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = 24.07, p< .001) in the jealousy condition relative to either the jack-o-lantern or book conditions. Results for follow up McNemar nonparametric tests are presented in Figure 1. Of particular interest, dogs specifically tried to get between the owner and the object more often in the jealousy condition (Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = 6.53, p< .04). Such behaviors aimed at preventing or breaking up a liaison have been hypothesized to be the primary motivational state that accompanies jealousy and that distinguishes jealousy from other emotions such as anger [1], [19]. Although vocalizations during the experiment were relatively infrequent, whining occurred significantly more in the jealousy condition than in the book condition. Barking did not significantly differ across conditions. At the suggestion of a reviewer, we summed the behaviors presented in Figure 1 for each condition in order to get a sense of the effect size of the jealousy condition and performed within-subjects ANOVA with partial eta-squared tests. Partial eta-squared for the dog vs. jack-o-lantern conditions was .41 and for dog vs. book was .58. In the preverbal human infant literature, jealousy is accompanied not only by negative affect but also by heightened interest and attention toward the mother while she is interacting with what appears to be another infant [10][12]. We found similar effects in dogs. Results for within-subject ANOVAs are presented in the text while results for follow up paired t-tests are displayed in Figure 2. As shown in Figure 2, dogs gazed significantly more at their owners (F(2, 70) = 7.47, p< .001, = .18) and the objects (F(2, 70) = 56.39, p< .001, = .62) in the conditions in which the owner was displaying affection towards an object relative to the control condition of reading aloud. Furthermore, when the object of affection appeared to be a conspecific, dogs looked more at the object relative to when it was a novel item (jack-o-lantern). This pattern is furthered supported by the inversely related measures of disinterest, operationally defined by orienting the body away from the owner and object (Figure 2). Dogs spent significantly more time ignoring the owner and object in the book condition relative to the conditions that involved displays of affection: F(2, 70) = 30.62, p< .001, = .47 for owner; F(2, 70) = 87.27, p< .001, = .71 for object. Behaviors during the post-task period were similar to those seen during the actual interaction (although less informative given that behavior was merely coded as present/absent). More dogs ignored the object in the jack-o-lantern (94.4%) and book (91.7%) conditions than in the dog condition (52.8%); Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = 20.01, p< .001. There was also a significant difference in the number of dogs who observed the object across conditions (72.2% in dog condition; 63.9% in jack-o-lantern condition; and 44.4% in book condition): Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = 6.58, p< .04. There was not a significant difference in the number of dogs who followed their owner after each condition, 2 (2) = 4.67, p = .10. Was the stuffed dog perceived as real? One might wonder whether the subject dogs believed that the stuffed animal was a real dog. The data discussed previously, particularly the aggressive behaviors aimed at the stuffed animal, would seem to suggest that they did. Perhaps even more compellingly, 86% of the dogs sniffed the anal region of the toy dog during the experiment or post-experiment phases. Having a faux rival dog enabled us to maximize the amount of control we had in the experiment. That jealousy behaviors were seen under these somewhat impoverished social conditions leads us to predict that such behaviors would be even more enhanced in the present of an actual rival dog who responded to the owner's affectionate displays. In the present work any single behavior might not be indicative of jealousy per se. However, the pattern of behaviors, particularly when dogs were confronted with their owners displaying affection to what appeared to be another dog, is similar to the constellation of behaviors seen in humans. These data thus present a strong case that domestic dogs have a form of jealousy. Individual Differences An anonymous reviewer suggested that our data might reflect individual differences in dog cognition and/or jealousy. One possibility is that only some dogs perceived the stuffed dog as real and that this difference in cognitive ability resulted in jealousy in some dogs but not others. To the reviewer's mind, only those dogs that aggressed against the rival dog can be shown to definitively consider the fake dog stimulus as real. We believe that the fact that the vast majority of the dogs sniffed the anal region of the stuffed dog (including all of the aggressive dogs) suggests that most of the dogs conceptualized the dog as real, but we cannot rule out the reviewer's suggestion. However, even if most dogs perceived the stimulus as real, it is still possible that only some of them reacted with jealousy to it. The reviewer suggested some additional analyses to explore possible individual differences. One question is whether the snapping dogs were the only ones to show additional jealous behaviors. As described below, our data suggest that they were not, although their jealousy might be argued to be more intense in some respects than their nonsnapping peers. In total, 41.7% of dogs snapped during or after their owner interacted with the stuffed dog. We found that these aggressive dogs did display many other jealous behaviors: All of them pushed at the owner and 86.7% pushed at the fake dog during the jealousy interaction. There was also some tendency for these dogs to spend more time (although not significantly so) attending to the owner and the fake dog (and conversely less time ignoring the owner and rival) than nonsnapping dogs. However, not all jealous behaviors were more common in the snapping dogs. Whining was similar across the two types of dogs and while 26.7% of the snapping dogs attempted to get between their owner and the rival dog, 33.3% of the nonaggressive dogs did so. Moreover, many of the nonsnapping dogs also displayed other jealousy indicators. For example, 61.9% pushed at the owner and 57.1% pushed at the stuffed dog. These percents are higher if the dogs that did not sniff the rear end are excluded (who likely did not perceive the stuffed dog as a threat). Thus, these exploratory analyses would argue against the suggestion that only aggressive dogs displayed jealous behaviors, although their jealousy may be viewed as more extreme. These data raise the possibility that dogs, like humans, show individual differences in how jealousy is exhibited, which ranges from attention seeking and restorative behaviors to aggressive acts. The fact some dogs (13.8%) failed to sniff the rear end of the fake dog raises stimulating questions for future studies. Jealous behaviors were infrequent among these animals, suggesting that they were not in an emotional state (e.g., none pushed on the owner or the stuffed dog and only one got between them). One interesting possible avenue for future work is to examine the cognitive abilities that are associated with not believing the stuffed dog is real. It might be that such dogs are less cognitively sophisticated (they do not perceive the toy as representation of a real dog.). However, it is also possible that they are more sophisticated, (i.e., were not fooled into believing that the stuffed dog was genuine, and hence it was not a threat). In sum, it may be that while all dogs have the neurobiological cognitive capacity for jealousy, the current situation may have failed to induce the emotional state in some dogs. Understanding what factors (cognition or social dynamics) contribute to individual differences in dog jealousy would seem a ripe area for future work.",TRUE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dogs-jealousy-study/,Science,Snopes
402,Science Mission Directorate,"Mark your calendars: a series of three supermoons will appear on the celestial stage on December 3, 2017, January 1, 2018, and January 31, 2018. A supermoon is a Moon that is full when it is also at or near its closest point in its orbit around Earth. Since the Moons orbit is elliptical, one side (apogee) is about 30,000 miles (50,000 km) farther from Earth than the other (perigee). Nearby perigee full Moons appear about 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full Moons that occur near apogee in the Moon's orbit. The supermoons are a great opportunity for people to start looking at the Moon, not just that once but every chance they have! says Noah Petro, a research scientist from NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center. Its hard for our eyes to distinguish these small changes in size when the Moon is high amidst the vastness of the night sky. But any time you catch a full Moon as it rises or sets, while its suspended low on the horizon beaming through the silhouettes of trees or buildings, its apparent size might make you do a double-take. You almost feel as though you could reach out, grab the glowing orb, and drop it into your coffee cup. Even more so if its a supermoon. If you can only catch one episode of the supermoon trilogy, catch the third one. It will be extra special. First of all, the January 31st supermoon will feature a total lunar eclipse, with totality viewable from western North America across the pacific to Eastern Asia. The Moons orbit around our planet is tilted so it usually falls above or below the shadow of the Earth. About twice each year, a full Moon lines up perfectly with the Earth and Sun such that Earths shadow totally blocks the Suns light, which would normally reflect off the Moon. The lunar eclipse on January 31 will be visible during moonset. Folks in the Eastern United States, where the eclipse will be partial, will have to get up in the morning to see it, notes Petro. But its another great chance to watch the Moon. The Moon will lose its brightness and take on an eerie, fainter-than-normal glow from the scant sunlight that makes its way through Earths atmosphere. Often cast in a reddish hue because of the way the atmosphere bends the light, totally eclipsed Moons are sometimes called blood Moons. Were seeing all of the Earths sunrises and sunsets at that moment reflected from the surface of the Moon, says Sarah Noble, a Program Scientist at NASA headquarters. The January 31st supermoon will also be the second full Moon of the month. Some people call the second full Moon in a month a Blue Moon, that makes it a super blue Moon. Blue Moons happen every two and a half years, on average. With the total eclipse, itll be a royal spectacle indeed: a super blue blood Moon. Sometimes the celestial rhythms sync up just right to wow us. Heed your calendar reminders. On the three dates marked, step out into the moonset or moonrise and look up for a trilogy of sky watching treats! To learn more about the many wonders of the Moon, go to moon.nasa.gov.

445,The Man Who Named Bluetooth,"Its nearly impossible today to go anywhere without seeing someone talking into a tiny earpiece, but the headsets with blinking blue lights were not so common just a decade ago. Use of Bluetooth-equipped devices has stretched across the globe, yet the technologys origins and name can be traced to an engineer obsessed with making computers function using as little energy as possible. Originally intended as a wireless replacement for cables to connect phones, headsets, computers, keyboards and mice, Bluetooth technology has proliferated over the past decade, allowing devices in close proximity to connect while using very little battery power. The headsets are ubiquitous, but according to the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) they are only one of many product types that make up the 9 billion Bluetooth devices in the world today. That number keeps growing. Over the next 2 years, annual Bluetooth device shipments are expected to double from 2 to 4 billion, according to ABI Research. Intel mobile computing engineer Jim Kardach was instrumental in bringing together Ericsson, IBM, Intel, Nokia and Toshiba to form the Bluetooth SIG in 1998. That group created the universal standard that is used by more than 17,000 member companies. Kardach recalls playing the role of instigator and mediator among the founding companies, but says the group quickly agreed on a common goal to create a small, low-power consuming, low-cost, short-range radio with built-in security and the ability to connect ad hoc with other devices. Inspired by a book about Vikings that he was reading at the time, he came up with the Bluetooth name. Just days before he retired in December, Kardach reflected on his 27-year career at Intel, including the genesis of Bluetooth, the many low-power design breakthroughs that led to 100 patents and his work on the first notebook system-on-chip (SoC) sold in the 1980s by Intel called the 386SL/486SL. How did you get involved with the creation of Bluetooth? I got the assignment in 1997 when my boss at the time came up to me and said, Youre finishing up the ACPI stuff, can you figure out how to integrate wireless into the notebook? We got together Ericsson, Nokia, Toshiba and IBM. That probably represented 60 percent of both the cellphone and notebook markets at the time. The key was to define the goals of what we wanted to do. We formed a SIG, all agreeing that we wanted to build this universal, very low-cost, private, wireless cable. We did it under an open IP (intellectual property) policy, allowing us to take the best pieces from everywhere and put them together. We had goals on what we wanted this thing to cost and strategies for it being built on a bulk CMOS process, which hadnt been done before. It had security, privacy and had to work across the world, so we picked the ISM band, which required fixing some of the regulatory issues around it. We had a term sheet that everyone agreed to and we put it together. Intel became the leader simply because we had IBM and Toshiba who didnt trust each other, and Ericsson and Nokia who didnt trust each other, so we were kind of the Switzerland. How does a chief power architect look at things? Power is one of the key attributes. Battery life is life. Its the life of the product. To ignore that is totally unacceptable. You have to design things to work efficiently, but more importantly, do nothing efficiently. Those are the two rules of power management. We rely on architectural designs to lower power use. We design chips to turn things off and back on only when theyre needed. We architect things to minimize latency and anticipate when something is needed so it gets turned on just in time. We used to rely on randomness, like when you drive to work and hope to miss all of the red lights, but more recently weve purposely tried to line up activities in order to create big idle gaps between these activities. If the idle gaps are long enough, we can shut off all of the power. For example, we now have special offloading accelerators that run to do specialized media loads and then be able to put the rest of the platform to a low-power state, which means 98 percent of it is powered off. Hardware not designed for power management can be like crying babies that wake up the whole house. They ping memory every couple of milliseconds or microseconds, keeping the CPU out of its low-power state. This can keep memory and the busses between them alive. A Bluetooth radio should require about a milliwatt of power, but when you put it on a USB plug, because of the way the bus was architected, it generates an extra 6 watts of power by pinging memory every millisecond. These are things we want to catch up front when architecting for good power management. The fourth-generation Intel Core processors that use an SoC design are coming out soon. Whats the advantage of SoCs over traditional CPU designs? SoC allows you to do things that arent possible if you have a handful of chips from different venders. We have the advantage of doing our own chipsets and CPUs, which allows us to design power management between them and the rest of the platform. In the 1980s I worked on the 3SL and 4SL SoCs. We were doing it in an era where we were cramming hundreds of thousands of transistors on a die and now we can fit billions. We can now take advantage of Moores Law and increased capacity that were getting from bigger wafers and smaller transistors. This lets us integrate more capabilities into a small chip. Having an SoC allows us to bring power management across the platform. With the 3SL, we added new operating modes to the CPU that pulled some power management underneath the operating system. This work is still used today. To design an SoC, sometimes you have to trade off time to market but you can really take advantage of them to manage power consumption.

Now about the water receding....that has happened before in acklins in 1936 and this by the way is not a normal phenomena but has happened several times before but it is due to the hurricane. What happened in this case was that the low pressure of the hurricane pushed down on the water in the eye and eye wall of the hurricane which is a low pressure system at at the center of the storm which gives you the high l ... evel storm surge but in nature the is a never ending process of trying or forcing to maintain a perfect because at the center the water height is pretty high and Irma had 15-20 ft storm surge but that water which produces this bulging effect takes water from its surroundings to be transferred into the eye so the water receding is part of this storm.

976,"Lunar Eclipse, Comet, and Snow Moon Coming in February 2017","On 10 February 2017, sky watchers will experience a confluence of three celestial events in the same night: a penumbral lunar eclipse, a snow moon, and a comet. The lunar eclipse will be somewhat less spectacular than the image usually conjured up by that term: This weekends event is whats known as a penumbral lunar eclipse, a much more subtle counterpart to the dramatic total eclipse. As the moon rises on Friday, it will pass through the outer edge of the Earths shadow, called the penumbra. During these type of eclipses, you will see a darkening of the moon from the bottom edge moving towards the top as the night progresses but not a total lunar blackout. The eclipse will begin around 5:45 p.m. ET (4:45 p.m. CT)  shortly before moonrise  and end at around 9:50 p.m. ET (8:50 p.m. CT). The best viewing time will be around 7:45 p.m. ET (6:45 p.m. CT). You can see all the time information from NASA here. A penumbral eclipse is less striking than a full or partial lunar eclipse, in which the moon turns blood red or appears to have had a bite taken out of it. Instead, in a penumbral eclipse, observers may notice only a darkening of the moons face: In a total eclipse of the moon, the inner part of Earths shadow, called the umbra, falls on the moons face. At mid-eclipse, the entire moon is in shadow, which may appear blood red. In a partial lunar eclipse, the umbra takes a bite out of only a fraction of the moon. The dark bite grows larger, and then recedes, never reaching the total phase. In a penumbral lunar eclipse, only the more diffuse outer shadow of Earth falls on the moons face. This third kind of lunar eclipse is much more subtle, and much more difficult to observe, than either a total or partial eclipse of the moon. There is never a dark bite taken out of the moon, as in a partial eclipse. The eclipse never progresses to reach the dramatic minutes of totality. At best, at mid-eclipse, very observant people will notice a dark shading on the moons face. Others will look and notice nothing at all. The full moon aspect of this trifecta isnt really unusual at all, since lunar eclipses can only occur when the moon is full. News accounts having been playing up the fact that this full moon will be a snow moon, but thats simply the traditional name given to the full moon that occurs every February in North America (due to its coincidence with snow and cold air temperatures). If thats not enough, a green-hued comet will also hurtle past Earth in the early morning hours of 11 February 2017. According to Sky & Telescope the comet, 45P/Honda-Mrkos-Pajdusakova, will zoom by the planet at 3 a.m. EST at a distance of 7.7 million miles:",TRUE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/lunar-eclipses-full-moons/,Science,Snopes

""We must have American dominance in space. Very importantly, I'm hereby directing the Department of Defense and Pentagon to immediately begin the process necessary to establish the Space Force as the sixth branch of the armed forces.

""We are going to have the Air Force and we are going to have the Space Force: separate but equal, it is going to be something so important,"" he said. The term ""separate but equal"" became a legal precedent following an 1896 Supreme Court ruling Plessy v. Ferguson that said the use of racially separate facilities, if equal, was not discrimination. That legal rationale was deemed unconstitutional through a series of Supreme Court decisions, ending with 1954's Brown v. Board of Education.

6110,Evidence Emerges That Hawaii Eruptions Caused By Fracking,"Scientific data has linked the surge in volcanic activity in Hawaii to increased fracking activity at Puna Geothermal Venture. The data shows how the fracking may have been deliberately designed to create a geological process by which lava would drain from Kilaueas summit into the East Rift Zone so as to create large new vents that would destabilize the geology, and trigger a major collapse in the Hilina Fault System. Exopolitics.org reports: A video prepared by Pacific Tsunamic Warning Center clearly shows that the epicenter of earthquake activity centered in the lower Puna region is adjacent to the Puna Geothermal Venture. The following map from the video depicts all the earthquakes and the eruption site for the recent lava outbreak from 30 April to 6 May. The eruption occurs mainly in Leilani Estates, which is right next to the Puna Geothermal Venture. The following map by the US Geological Service shows where the Puna Geothermal Venture (marked PGV) is in relation to the current volcanic eruption. Heres a photo showing the lava outbreak and its very close proximity to the Puna Geothermal Venture (circled in red) on May 22. Since then, it has begun flowing onto the property, but still not reached any of the wells. The scientific data clearly shows how the Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV) is at the epicenter of the volcanic eruption. Is this merely chance or by design? In my previous article and video published on May 15, I wrote about how the fracking activity at PGV has been scientifically linked to earthquakes. The following diagram was included which clearly showed the strong correlation: Since the publication of my article, there have been other articles linking the fracking at PGV with earthquakes, and also raising the question of whether the fracking caused the volcanic eruption. The most prominent one has come from Jon Rappoport, who wrote a May 22 article on his blogsite titled: Did fracking cause the Hawaii volcano eruption? In my May 15 article and video , I mentioned the Hilina Slump and how it may have been related to the fracking occurring at PGV. This has led to much criticism in the videos comments section, but the scientific facts do show that earthquake activity is related to movements in the Hilina Fault System. Heres a map showing the Hilina Fault System in relation to the East Rift Zone. The following map produced by the Hawaii Volcano Observatory shows how the recent earthquake activity led to the Hilina Slump slipping towards the Pacific Ocean Observatory by about two meters, which is massive in geological terms. While the earthquakes under the summit and under the eruption center at the eastern end of the rift zone are generated by the movement of magma, the big event and its aftershocks under the pali have a different origin. This becomes obvious in Figure 2 [reproduced above]. It shows how the permanent GPS stations installed and operated by the Hawaii Volcano Observatory moved in response to the 6.9 quake. The red arrows indicate the direction of horizontal motion and all of them point to the southeast. The length of each arrow represents the extent of the motion with the longest ones having moved by more than 2 feet. This shows that the flank of the cliff on the southern coast of Hawaii has moved further towards the ocean. What the article didnt mention was that the 6.9 quake on May 4 was triggered by the massive outflow of lava from Kilauea Summit, Halemaumau crater, into the East Rift Zone. Basically, the volcanic eruption in the Lower Puna region (where the Puna Geothermal Venture is located) is being fueled by fresh lava from the summit of Kileaua, which is being drained towards it. While it began slowly as old lava oozed out of the new volcanic fissures in Leilani Estates, the recent upsurge is a result of fresh new lava arriving from the Kilauea Summit. The Honolulu Advertise r explained the process: The first weeks of the eruption saw pasty, crumbly, slower-moving aa lava oozing slowly through the fissures. But that changed Friday afternoon, scientists said, when preliminary results from a testing sample showed a different composite of lava, the smoother pahoehoe variety that is generally fresher, hotter and faster. The following diagram shows the dynamics of the lava flows linking Kilauea Summit, the PuuOo Vent, and the East Rift Zone. An article by Scott Johnson in Ars Technica, explained the process as follows: Klaueas main magma chamber seems to be a few kilometers below Halemaumau Crater at its summit. When the volcanos guts gurgle with a new injection of magma from below, the lava lake in Halemaumau Crater rises. The conduits and crevices that constitute Klaueas plumbing extend from the summit region over to the East Rift Zone. So after lava rises in Halemaumau Crater, the lake sometimes drains back down as the new magma moves on toward the eastern section of the volcano. This is where we finally get to the issue of whether the fracking at Puna Geothermal Venture was secretly an attempt to weaken the underlying geology in order to create a path for fresh lava to drain from Kilauea summit into the East Rift Zone. As the following diagram of the East Rift Zone illustrates, lava follows the path of least resistance in a highly pressurized environment. This principle would be well known to any geologist, or plumber if we use Johnsons analogy. This means that some would have been aware from the inception of the PGV in 1993, that the process of using highly pressurized water on subterranean rocks (aka fracking), severely compromising the underground environment, would effectively open up a new path for lava to flow from the Kilauea summit and the PuuOo Vent Apparently, this is exactly what was planned by those behind the Puna Geothermal Venture according to Paul Collin , who has strong ties to the U.S. intelligence community: It is understood that Hawaiis geothermal power company Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV) purposefully drilled wells and fracked into the ground in such a way that lava from Earths mantle would eventually be redirected to open-up and spout a brand new volcano within the island of Hawaii, and sure enough facts set forth by a USGS chart and briefing that lava has now been routed right along the same linear path south-east, which actually punched-out a brand new caldera volcano within the Lower East Rift Zone adjacent to the extremely weak debris landmass known as the Hilani Slump consisting of 10% of Hawaiis southeastern land mass that was already slipping into the Pacific Ocean without the new lava delta growing huger; about 400 meters per hour on land (alone)  threatening a tsunami event from coast to coast. In my May 15 article, I described how the creation of a massive tsunami through a collapse of the Hilina slump was the secret purpose behind the creation of the Puna Geothermal Venture, whose owners are linked to the Rothschild family. I wish to state for the record that I dont believe the plan will succeed, and that the hoped-for megatsunami that would cripple the United States economically and militarily for decades to come will not occur. However, it is vitally important to expose this plan was and who is behind it. My view is that the Rothschild family has chosen China as the hub for the kind of New World Order that the Deep State/global elite would like to emerge. That would be an openly authoritarian state where AI technology is used to monitor citizens and quickly remove troublemakers expressing dissenting political views. The United States is the main obstacle to such an authoritarian New World Order being created, and secret geo-engineering was therefore undertaken in Hawaii that would create a megatsunami via a major collapse of the Hilina fault system. If the plan had worked, then it is not hard to see how the U.S. would have been unable to prevent a New World Order emerging  based on Chinas authoritarian socio-political model masked behind AI technology designed to appeal to a tech savvy Millennial generation. It is also important to mention that this is the second time in 2018 that Hawaii was targeted by the Deep State/global elites for some kind of catastrophic event that would economically and militarily weaken the United States. On January 13, 2018, a ballistic nuclear missile was sent by a secret CIA linked Navy, called the Dark Fleet, in a false flag attack that was meant to embroil the United States in a catastrophic nuclear war. In a January 20 article , I provided documents and references showing how the CIA has built its own secret fleet that conducts covert operations on behalf of the Deep State/global elite. Thankfully, that plan failed due to the intervention of a U.S. Air Force based secret space program that shot down the missile, as I discussed another article Since 2004, I have lived on Hawaiis Big Island. On May 1, 2018, I moved from the lower Puna region just as the earthquakes intensified, to the Kona side of the Big Island. It boggles the mind that such a beautiful part of our planet is being repeatedly targeted by the global elite for catastrophes that will facilitate their New World Order plans. I sincerely hope that appropriate legal and political action is taken against: all those behind the Puna Geothermal Venture for their role in the devastation that is being caused in the lower Puna region by their secret fracking; the local County officials that were likely bribed to remain silent over the risk of permitting such a venture; and also against the global elites who put together such a nefarious plan. .",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/did-fracking-cause-volcanic-activity-hawaii/,Science,Snopes

6333,POLITICS: Lawmaker says tumbling rocks are causing seas to rise,"Correction appended. The Earth is not warming. The White Cliffs of Dover are tumbling into the sea and causing sea levels to rise. Global warming is helping grow the Antarctic ice sheet. Those are some of the skeptical assertions echoed by Republicans on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee yesterday. The lawmakers at times embraced research that questions mainstream climate science during a hearing on how technology can be used to address global warming. A leading climate scientist testifying before the panel spent much of the two hours correcting misstatements. The purpose of the hearing was to focus on how technology could be deployed for climate change adaptation. But the hearing frequently turned to the basics of climate science. Many of the questions by Republicans and Democrats alike were directed to Philip Duffy, president of the Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts and former senior adviser to the U.S. Global Change Research Program. Advertisement Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) said he was bothered that established climate science has not been questioned more by the committee, which has accused federal climate scientists of fraudulently manipulating climate data and subpoenaed their records. ""I'm a little bit disturbed by, No. 1, over and over again, I hear, 'Don't ever talk about whether mankind is the main cause of the temperature changing and the climate changing,'"" he said. ""That's a little disturbing to hear constantly beaten into our heads in a Science Committee meeting, when basically we should all be open to different points of view."" Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), chairman of the committee, entered into the record an opinion piece published in The Wall Street Journal yesterday that claimed sea levels are not rising because of climate change, a view that rejects thousands of scientific studies. The piece was written by Fred Singer, who is affiliated with the Heartland Institute, which promotes the rejection of mainstream climate science. ""To solve climate change challenges, we first need to acknowledge the uncertainties that exist,"" Smith said in his opening remarks. ""Then we can have confidence that innovations and technology will enable us to mitigate any adverse consequences of climate change."" At one point, Smith showed a slide of two charts that he said demonstrated how the rate of sea-level rise does not equal the sharp spike in the consumption of fossil fuels. When Smith pointed out that rates of sea-level rise have only increased slightly compared with the rate of fossil fuel use, Duffy pointed out that his chart was from a single tide gauge station, near San Francisco, and that sea levels rise at different rates around the world. Smith did not show rising atmospheric CO2 levels or temperatures, both of which have climbed steadily in recent decades as emissions have increased. ""The rate of global sea-level rise has accelerated and is now four times faster than it was 100 years ago,"" Duffy told Smith in response to the charts. ""Is this chart inaccurate, then?"" Smith asked. ""It's accurate, but it doesn't represent what's happening globally; it represents what's happening in San Francisco,"" Duffy said. Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) questioned Duffy on the factors that contribute to sea-level rise, pointing out that land subsidence plays a role, as well as human activity. Brooks then said that erosion plays a significant role in sea-level rise, which is not an idea embraced by mainstream climate researchers. He said the California coastline and the White Cliffs of Dover tumble into the sea every year, and that contributes to sea-level rise. He also said that silt washing into the ocean from the world's major rivers, including the Mississippi, the Amazon and the Nile, is contributing to sea-level rise. ""Every time you have that soil or rock or whatever it is that is deposited into the seas, that forces the sea levels to rise, because now you have less space in those oceans, because the bottom is moving up,"" Brooks said. Duffy responded: ""I'm pretty sure that on human time scales, those are minuscule effects."" Brooks added that Antarctic ice is growing. That was true a few years ago, and scientists say it does not disprove the theory of global warming because different factors affect the Arctic and Antarctic rates of melting. ""We have satellite records clearly documenting a shrinkage of the Antarctic ice sheet and an acceleration of that shrinkage,"" Duffy said. ""I'm sorry, but I don't know where you're getting your information, but the data I have seen suggests  "" Brooks said. Duffy answered: ""The National Snow and Ice Data Center and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration."" ""Well, I've got a NASA base in my district, and apparently, they're telling you one thing and me a different thing,"" Brooks said. ""But there are plenty of studies that have come that show with respect to Antarctica that the total ice sheet, particularly that above land, is increasing, not decreasing. Now, you could make a different argument if you want to talk about Greenland or the Arctic."" Earlier this year, NASA researchers determined that Antarctica's ice loss has accelerated in the last decade. More broadly, sea ice extent at both poles set a record low last year. Scientists are racing to better understand the changes occurring in Antarctica because much of its ice is land-based, meaning it could drive sea-level rise around the world as it melts. Rep. Bill Posey (R-Fla.) said scientists said in the 1970s that the Earth was cooling, a popular talking point of climate skeptics and the subject of a fake Time magazine cover that has become a meme. Duffy corrected him and said that was essentially an outlier position at the time and that scientists long ago determined that humans were warming the planet. Posey also asked how carbon dioxide could be captured in permafrost in the periods before humans existed. Duffy told him that it was from non-decayed organic matter. Human activity is now causing the Arctic to warm and thaw the ground, releasing the carbon into the atmosphere, Duffy said. Posey then asked about theories related to warming being beneficial for habitats and to people. ""What do you say to people who theorize that the Earth as it continues to warm is returning to its normal temperature?"" Posey asked. ""Look, if you want to characterize a temperature above today's temperature as normal, you're free to do that, but that doesn't mean that's a planet we want to live on,"" Duffy said. ""I don't want to get philosophical; I'm trying to stay on science here,"" Posey said. ""I'm not getting philosophical; I'm getting extremely practical,"" Duffy said. ""I'm being extremely practical  if we let the planet warm 2 or 3 degrees, we will have tens of meters of sea-level rise, and the community where I live will essentially cease to exist."" Posey responded: ""I don't think anybody disputes that the Earth is getting warmer; I think what's not clear is the exact amount of who caused what, and getting to that is, I think, where we're trying to go with this committee.""

6480,Your Body Is Younger Than You Think,"Most molecules in a cell are constantly being replaced but the DNA is not. All the carbon-14 in a cell's DNA is acquired on the cell's birth date, the day its parent cell divided. Hence the extent of carbon-14 enrichment could be used to figure out the cell's age, Dr. Frisen surmised. In practice, the method has to be performed on tissues, not individual cells, because not enough carbon-14 gets into any single cell to signal its age. Dr. Frisen then worked out a scale for converting carbon-14 enrichment into calendar dates by measuring the carbon-14 incorporated into individual tree rings in Swedish pine trees. Having validated the method with various tests, he and his colleagues have reported in the July 15 issue of Cell the results of their first tests with a few body tissues. Cells from the muscles of the ribs, taken from people in their late 30's, have an average age of 15.1 years, they say. The epithelial cells that line the surface of the gut have a rough life and are known by other methods to last only five days. Ignoring these surface cells, the average age of those in the main body of the gut is 15.9 years, Dr. Frisen found. The Karolinska team then turned to the brain, the renewal of whose cells has been a matter of much contention. Prevailing belief, by and large, is that the brain does not generate new neurons after its structure is complete, except in two specific regions, the olfactory bulb that mediates the sense of smell, and the hippocampus where initial memories of faces and places are laid down. This consensus view was challenged a few years ago by Elizabeth Gould of Princeton, who reported finding new neurons in the cerebral cortex, along with the elegant idea that each day's memories might be recorded in the neurons generated that day. Dr. Frisen's method will enable all regions of the brain to be dated to see if any new neurons are generated. So far he has tested only cells from the visual cortex. He finds these are exactly the same age as the individual, showing that new neurons are not generated after birth in this region of the cerebral cortex, or at least not in significant numbers. Cells of the cerebellum are slightly younger than those of the cortex, which fits with the idea that the cerebellum continues developing after birth.

The conventional view that it does not has recently been challenged by Dr. Piero Anversa of the New York Medical College in Valhalla. Dr. Frisen has found the heart as a whole is generating new cells but he has not yet measured the turnover rate of the heart's muscle cells. Although people may think of their body as a fairly permanent structure, most of it is in a state of constant flux as old cells are discarded and new ones generated in their place. Each kind of tissue has its own turnover time, depending in part on the workload endured by its cells. The cells lining the stomach, as mentioned, last only five days. The red blood cells, bruised and battered after traveling nearly 1,000 miles through the maze of the body's circulatory system, last only 120 days or so on average before being dispatched to their graveyard in the spleen. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The epidermis, or surface layer of the skin, is recycled every two weeks or so. The reason for the quick replacement is that ""This is the body's saran wrap, and it can be easily damaged by scratching, solvents, wear and tear,"" says Elaine Fuchs, an expert on the skin's stem cells at Rockefeller University. As for the liver, the detoxifier of all the natural plant poisons and drugs that pass a person's lips, its life on the chemical warfare front is quite short. An adult human liver probably has a turnover time of 300 to 500 days, says Markus Grompe, an expert on the liver's stem cells at the Oregon Health & Science University. Other tissues have lifetimes measured in years, not days, but are still far from permanent. Even the bones endure nonstop makeover. The entire human skeleton is thought to be replaced every 10 years or so in adults, as twin construction crews of bone-dissolving and bone-rebuilding cells combine to remodel it. About the only pieces of the body that last a lifetime, on present evidence, seem to be the neurons of the cerebral cortex, the inner lens cells of the eye and perhaps the muscle cells of the heart. The inner lens cells form in the embryo and then lapse into such inertness for the rest of their owner's lifetime that they dispense altogether with their nucleus and other cellular organelles. But if the body remains so perpetually youthful and vigorous, and so eminently capable of renewing its tissues, why doesn't the regeneration continue forever? Some experts believe the root cause is that the DNA accumulates mutations and its information is gradually degraded. Others blame the DNA of the mitochondria, which lack the repair mechanisms available for the chromosomes. A third theory is that the stem cells that are the source of new cells in each tissue eventually grow feeble with age. ""The notion that stem cells themselves age and become less capable of generating progeny is gaining increasing support,"" Dr. Frisen said. He hopes to see if the rate of a tissue's regeneration slows as a person ages, which might point to the stem cells as being what one unwetted heel was to Achilles, the single impediment to immortality.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/does-body-replace-itself-seven-years/,Science,Snopes
7131,"Sex Robots That Can Cook, Clean Efficiently Will Be Available By 2019","WORLDWIDE  According to reports, tech companies that are producing realistic sex robots are trying to reach the next level in creating sex robots that can cook and clean. Company spokespersons say the cooking and cleaning sex robots can be available for purchase as soon as next year. Sex Robots have become a very hot topic, both criticized and praised. Many think sex robots will have a negative impact on society and sex life, as people may choose sex robots over actual people. With many people on Twitter making jokes about how sex robots cannot cook and clean, unfortunately for them, cleaning and cooking sex robots is already happening. Ive dated around six women in my entire life says Jan Kunchai, an engineer at RealBotix, and all six cheated on me, Im six for six like Jordan. Anyways i thought it would be a good idea to create a robot that can cook and clean so i dont have to get cheated on anymore, the next step would probably be a sex robot that can reproduce. Although a sex robot that can cook and clean efficiently seems like a very difficut task, company engineers say they can be here by 2019. Will you be purchasing one of these robots?

7267,Eating alligator in New Orleans could help save the wetlands of Louisiana,"American alligator 8 million years first protected Endangered Species Preservation Act in 66 Thehas remained nearly untouched by evolution for the last. It has hunted in the Southeastern wetlands as an apex predator, unaffected by sea levels or fluctuating temperatures. Nearly hunted to extinction by 1950, alligators were one of thespecies in 1962. They helped usher in the creation of theand by 1987, the alligator had become a rousing success story, pronounced fully recovered.With healthy levels returned, they demonstrated the programs effectiveness and future promise. Today, the American alligators story is experiencing another plot twist. Cavan The American alligator has been so protected, its now over-populated, said Nathan Richard, the executive chef ofin New Orleans. Hes both passionate and creative when it comes to cooking alligator  hes done nose-to-tail preparations and hosted a vanishing wetlands supper series. For Richard, normalizing this protein on menus again is essential to protecting the Louisiana wetlands. Too many alligators means too many fish and turtles being killed, he said, as we tucked into a bowl of his incredible curry piquant. Fried alligator tenderloin was slathered in a coconut sauce, made from hot red curry, fish sauce, soy, sliced ginger and gochujang paste. It was fragrant and spicy, bringing both moments of classic Louisiana flavor with intense notes of Southeast Asian cuisine. A perfectly crackled exterior resembled fried chicken, but the meat within was more akin in consistency to a super-tender octopus. The interior at Cavan Sara Essex Bradley This overpopulation also means a physical destruction of the marshes and the destruction of fishing traps and bait, said Richard. Thats a problem for the commercial fishermen. Our wetlands and marshes are our first line of defense against hurricanes, and without them, the flooding will become even more extreme. While Richard is not the only man cooking gator in New Orleans, hes likely one of the few chefs of his caliber with such a hands-on approach to the animal in the wild. Boating through the bayou in Louisiana Jenny Adams/Mic Ive been hunting alligator since I was a kid growing up in Thibodaux, Louisiana, he said. Alligator is not only high-protein and low-fat, its also able to be sustainably sourced. The way we trap them, theres no pain or stress until the moment its killed. If you do it right, its very, very fast. And if you do it wrong? I asked. If you hunt alligator wrong, youre in big trouble, he said with a laugh. The sound fits his massive frame  when hes not hunting gator, Richards is a volunteer fireman. His exploration of new ways to cook alligator continues to excite guests whove come to love the meat. Its far beyond fried alligator bites in a basket  a common sight in the city. I learned from Australian crocodile recipes that you can do a baby-back ribs, he said. When I worked at Kingfish, I hosted nose-to-tail dinners. For those, I broke down an entire alligator and prepared each part differently. The cheek is delicious, but the liver is totally inedible. His grits and alligator grillades arrived on the Cavan menu this winter, with pan-fried cutlets cooked in bacon fat and braised in a reduction of celery, onions, bell pepper and garlic  served over stone-ground, mascarpone and edam cheese grits. Chef Nathan Richard at Cavan Cavan I was eager to get a more up-close-and-personal look at the wetlands, and, admittedly, at the alligators. It turns out, a lot of people are similarly inclined and hunting (with professionals) is now a tourism activity. Cypress Point Richard has become friends with a biologist and conservationist, Dr. Ray J. Matherne, the owner of a 1,700-acre wetland preserve about 30 minutes from New Orleans in Bayou Des Allemands. Matherne has spent a lifetime studying this ecosystem and today takes guests on tours, crawfish harvests. In September  the only month alligator hunting is legal  hell even take guests on two-day alligator hunts. Theres no place to stay directly on his property, but the drive isnt too long from New Orleans. 40% of all the wetlands in the U.S United States Geological Survey Louisianas 3 million acres of wetlands represent. According to the, they are being lost at a rate of 75 square kilometers annually. In Des Allemands and other bayous like it, you add in the overpopulation of an apex predator into the equation and the effects are deeply felt. The wetlands at Cypress Point Jenny Adams/Mic Thirty years ago, the demand for hides was tremendous, Matherne said, as we set out in a duo of small, battered outboards, not quite as long as a fully grown gator. But with the anti-fur movement, it has dropped considerably. Now, we hunt for population control and we hunt to save the wetlands. Theres no doubt hunting also benefits these bayou communities in other ways  from the processors to locals who have their own, day-to-day issues with this overpopulation. Hes an expert on the area. You can see egrets, heron, ibis and even bald eagles nesting, he said. And we do a private alligator harvest, a crawfish harvest, fishing, duck hunting and bass fishing. Mathernes preserve has Spanish moss dripping dreamily off cypress, gum, and oak trees. Its easy to forget we are here for a hunt  the first of a two-day hunt is rather relaxing. We set traps using 12-foot long willow poles with a long, nylon rope tied to both ends. The poles are planted at a 45-degree angle deep into the mud. On the top of each pole, a piece of raw chicken hangs from a massive, metal hook dangling about a foot off the water. The alligators begin their own hunt at dusk. Sniffing the rotten meat, they burst from the water to swallow the it whole, settling on the mud below to digest  without noticing that theyve swallowed a hook and line, too. The alligators from the hunt before they are processed Jenny Adams/Mic Lets say we never came back, said Matherne on the second day of our hunt. It would do them no harm. An alligators digestive system is so acidic, its strong enough to dissolve a hubcap. In a matter of days, it would all dissolve, and the alligator would swim away. A missing chicken alerts us we might have a gator. Richard stands in the boat, hauling the pole and line upwards. Another hunter stands alongside him with a rifle pointed at the water. Its mere seconds before an 11-foot alligator rises to the surface, suddenly furious and thrashing. The water is boiling and the boats are rocking with considerable force. Birds go screaming from the tree canopy. If you need anything to hunt an alligator, I realize, its an incredible trifecta of balance, bravery and marksmanship  falling in would likely mean death. A quick bullet is fired into the center of alligators the head, and just like that, the swamp goes quiet again.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/will-eating-alligator-save-wetlands/,Science,Snopes

7391,Cellphones driving modern humans to the brink of insanity? New science reveals young brains DERANGED by cellphone radiation exposure,"is there a common cause behind the insanity? Natural News ) Its fairly obvious to most intelligent people that modern society is going insane . Its especially true among todays hyper-connected youth who seem to be truly deranged and mentally ill, hyperventilating over every issue imaginable such as net neutrality or the election of Donald Trump. The lunacy of modern society has never been more extreme, and many of us who observe all this are wondering As it turns out, the mass poisoning of human brains with cellphone radiation has only been going on for a generation or so. It may be the common cause behind the insanity, and California health authorities have just confirmed this possibility by issuing new warnings about the adverse brain effects of cellphone radiation exposure. directly interfere with normal brain function, leading people to demonstrate abnormal cognitive function. This, combined with the brain-warping harmful effects of social media, seems to have driven our society to the brink of runaway mental illness across the masses. The research suggests cellphones could increase our risk for brain cancer and tumors, low sperm count, headaches, as well as impaired memory, hearing, and sleep, reports CBS News / San Francisco . In other words, cellphone radiation has been found to, leading people to demonstrate abnormal cognitive function. This, combined with the brain-warping harmful effects of social media, seems to have driven our society to the brink of runaway mental illness across the masses. Just as the Romans destroyed their civilization with the help of lead poisoning in the water aqueducts, we may be destroying our own civilization by frying all our brains with cellphone radiation (and thereby driving our people insane). Cellphone radiation brain damage explains how snowflakes and crybullies came into existence According to the article linked above, 95 percent of Americans are now using cellphones on a regular basis. This is even true among todays youth who seem to be addicted to the devices (as portals for social media chats, photo sharing and the like). But is all this device time frying young brains and interfering with neurological development? Could cellphone radiation exposure, in other words, be responsible for the snowflake generation of fragile crybullies and emotional wrecks that now seem to dominate college campuses across our nation? A new documentary called Generation Zapped looks at the stunning health risks associated with wireless technology and mobile devices. Found at GenerationZapped.com , the new documentary dares to examine the medical and health implications of prolonged cellphone radiation exposure. See the trailer here: Sorry This video does not exist. The documentary also covers smart meters and how they expose entire buildings full of people to electromagnetic radiation pollution. The wireless industry is the new Big Tobacco Inherent in the film is coverage of the massive scientific cover-up being waged by the industry. Were talking about a Big Tobacco-style cover-up of scientific evidence of harm. Powerful corporations that are deeply invested in wireless technology spend billions of dollars each year lobbying lawmakers and regulators to bury the truth about electropollution and the risk of EMF exposure. Thats why this film and its producers will, of course, be maliciously attacked by the wireless industry in exactly the same way big tobacco whistleblowers were attacked by the cigarette companies throughout the 1970s, 80s and 90s. (Its also why the vaccine industry viciously attacks anyone who points out how vaccines contain brain-damaging aluminum and mercury.) When the truth threatens a multi-billion-dollar industry, the truth is always attacked and suppressed, and such suppression of truth is always dressed up in the name of science. But its all fake science, of course. Or, better stated, industry science  which isnt actually science at all. Its just propaganda. Have we allowed an entire generation to be brain damaged by cellphones? The bigger question here, however, is what Im posing today: By ignoring the very real health risks of brain damage caused by cellphone radiation exposure, have we allowed an entire generation to become brain damaged? Its hard to look at snowflakes today and not conclude they are mentally deranged lunatics. See the videos below for some examples: As these videos demonstrate, a shocking number of todays youthful people are nothing short of raging lunatics. This is especially evident in the LGBT / trans community, which is now expanding its tolerance acronyms to include men who enjoy having intercourse with the tailpipes of automobiles . Every freakish, deranged sexual deviancy is now claimed to be a protected victim group, and theres no question the deranged Left will soon demand special protection for bestiality, pedophilia and those who engage in sexual acts with corpses. (Love wins! Um dude, maybe that isnt the kind of love you should be looking for) The political Left in America, in other words, is now trying to normalize mass mental illness for the simple reason that it has become so widespread that it almost seems common. But common doesnt make it normal or healthy. If an entire generation is mass poisoned, that doesnt make them all sane. It just means that the brain damage is extremely widespread (and therefore extremely dangerous to the long-term sustainability of society as a whole because no society that goes collectively insane has much of a future). The lunatic fringe of Americas culture, in other words, has found strength in numbers as more and more of our youth are becoming brain damaged by exposure to neurological poisons. These poisons no doubt also include pesticides in the food supply, but EMF pollution is rapidly emerging as perhaps the most damaging factor of all. Is it time to ban mobile devices for young people? Modern society has long agreed that cigarettes should be banned for young people because of the harm they cause young, developing bodies and brains. Today nobody argues that children should be able to buy a pack of Camels (although this was, of course, the big push by the tobacco industry decades ago). Now that science has confirmed cellphones pose a very real risk to the brains of young people, is it time to debate banning such devices from being habitually used by young people? The libertarian argument, of course, is, No way! Government has no role banning people from using cellphones at any age, they say. But what if cellphone use is proven to cause brain damage and mental illness? Then the argument becomes the same argument as the Big Tobacco scenario. At what point should the freedom of individuals be curtailed in the interests of protecting young people from severe brain damage caused by the use of certain products? Meth is currently illegal, by the way, for precisely this reason: It is widely known to be extremely damaging to human biology (and neurology). If harmful cellphones are legal for children to use, why dont the freedom argument people argue the same reasoning for meth use by children, too? Granted, there is a huge disparity between the severity of harm caused by meth vs. cellphones, but theres no question they both cause some degree of harm. How much harm are we as a society going to say is okay for children when theres a better option of causing no harm at all? This article isnt the right place to debate this issue, which is why Im primarily just raising the question here for future debate. Personally, I think parents who allow their children to acquire and use cellphones at any age under 12 years old are extremely irresponsible and causing serious long-term damage to their children. But the social pressure for all children to acquire such devices and use them for social conformity behaviors (i.e. snapchatting all their friends every 25 seconds to fit in) is overwhelming, so its easy to see why so many parents cave in and give their children mobile devices at increasingly young ages. Its time, I think, to start questioning the wisdom of such tolerance. Now that we know cellphones definitely cause long-term brain damage, we must debate this issue for the sake of all future children who may be unknowingly harming themselves with lifelong brain damage. Follow more news on all this at EMF.news and Brain.news . And check out the new film at GenerationZapped.com Its clear that something is damaging the brains of our youth",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/cell-phone-cause-brain-damage/,Science,Snopes
7420,this is bizarre: think twice about drinking Aquafina - The Hull Truth,"Re: this is bizarre: think twice about drinking Aquafina Quote: LI Sound Grunt - 7/27/2008 5:13 AM Its all pressure. I have noticed with beer in freezers - apparantly the amount of liquid varies slightly and so does the bottling pressure. The higher pressures keep the crystals from forming. This happens only with crystaline solids. Water fortunately is one of the few. If it was a non crystaline solid - and took up less space when solidified (molecules closer together) - we would have to learn to skate at the bottom of the ponds. Hydro - that's interesting. I would have thought that the tap water would be ""purer"" or at least lower bacteria - due to the chlorine. This is why,when we do buy the bottled waters, we try to get the city water source stuff like aqua and disanti. Is that true in general - or does it vary with source brand and batch? Also, does the spring water last as long? Is there any purification or such done to those brands? A guy named Hydro has to know this stuff, you know... I don't have any idea how or if spring water companies process their water before bottling, but i have to believe at least some disinfection would be required on the bottling equipment, if nothing else. When our staff take water samples for volatile organic compounds (benzene, chlorinated solvents, etc.) a ""trip blank"" has to accompany those samples in order to make sure the samples haven't been contaminated during shipping and handling. We try to use ultra-pure distilled water from the lab, but sometimes that is not available, so the lab tested some of the commonly available bottled waters for VOCs. I can't say which one was the best, but Captain Sid may be on to something.I don't have any idea how or if spring water companies process their water before bottling, but i have to believe at least some disinfection would be required on the bottling equipment, if nothing else.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/aquafina-bottled-water-not-freeze/,Science,Snopes
7494,When chocolate will go extinct,"Innovative Genomics Institute / University of California at Berkeley Cacao plants are slated to disappear by as early as 2050 thanks to warmer temperatures and dryer weather conditions. Scientists at the University of California are teaming up with Mars company to try to save the crop before it's too late. They're exploring the possibility of using the gene-editing technology CRISPR to make crops that can survive the new challenges. Beyond the glittery glass-and-sandstone walls of the University of Californias new biosciences building, rows of tiny green cacao seedlings in refrigerated greenhouses await judgment day. Under the watchful eye of Myeong-Je Cho , the director of plant genomics at an institute that's working with food and candy company Mars, the plants will be transformed. If all goes well, these tiny seedlings will soon be capable of surviving  and thriving  in the dryer, warmer climate that is sending chills through the spines of farmers across the globe. It's all thanks to a new technology called CRISPR, which allows for tiny, precise tweaks to DNA that were never possible before. These tweaks are already being used to make crops cheaper and more reliable. But their most important use may be in the developing world, where many of the plants that people rely on to avoid starvation are threatened by the impacts of climate change, including more pests and a lack of water. Cacao plants occupy a precarious position on the globe. They can only grow within a narrow strip of rainforested land roughly 20 degrees north and south of the equator, where temperature, rain, and humidity all stay relatively constant throughout the year. Over half of the world's chocolate now comes from just two countries in West Africa  Cte dIvoire and Ghana. But those areas won't be suitable for chocolate in the next few decades. By 2050, rising temperatures will push today's chocolate-growing regions more than 1,000 feet uphill into mountainous terrain  much of which is currently preserved for wildlife , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Mars, the $35 billion corporation best known for Snickers, is aware of these problems and others presented by climate change. In September, the company pledged $1 billion as part of an effort called ""Sustainability in a Generation,"" which aims to reduce the carbon footprint of its business and supply chain by more than 60% by 2050. ""We're trying to go all in here,"" Barry Parkin, Mars' chief sustainability officer, told Business Insider. ""There are obviously commitments the world is leaning into but, frankly, we don't think we're getting there fast enough collectively."" Its initiative with Cho at UC Berkeley is another arm of that efforts. If all goes as planned, they could develop cacao plants that dont wilt or rot at their current elevations, doing away with the need to relocate farms or find another approach. Jennifer Doudna, the UC Berkeley geneticist who invented CRISPR, is overseeing the collaboration with Mars. Although her tool has received more attention for its potential to eradicate human diseases and make so-called designer babies, Doudna thinks its most profound applications wont be on humans but rather on the food they eat. Courtney Verrill An avid tomato gardener, Doudna thinks her tool can benefit everyone from large food companies like Mars to individual hobbyists like herself. Personally, Id love a tomato plant with fruit that stayed on the vine longer, Doudna told Business Insider. The research lab she oversees at UC Berkeley is called the Innovative Genomics Institute. Many of the efforts by graduate students there focus on using CRISPR to benefit small-holder farmers in the developing world. One such project aims to protect cassava  a key crop that prevents millions of people from starving each year  from climate change by tweaking its DNA to produce less of a dangerous toxin that it makes in hotter temperatures. Doudna founded a company called Caribou Biosciences to put CRISPR into practice, and has also licensed the technology to agricultural company DuPont Pioneer for use in crops like corn and mushrooms. Regardless of which crop the public sees CRISPR successfully used in first, the technology will be a key tool in a growing arsenal of techniques we'll need if we plan to continue eating things like chocolate as the planet warms.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/chocolate-extinct-40-years/,Science,Snopes
7538,Tidalgate: Climate Alarmists Caught Faking Sea Level Rise,"Alarmist scientists have been caught red-handed tampering with raw data in order to exaggerate sea level rise. The raw (unadjusted) data from three Indian Ocean gauges  Aden, Karachi and Mumbai  showed that local sea level trends in the last 140 years had been very gently rising, neutral or negative (ie sea levels had fallen). But after the evidence had been adjusted by tidal records gatekeepers at the global databank Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) it suddenly showed a sharp and dramatic rise. The whistle was blown by two Australian scientists Dr. Albert Parker and Dr. Clifford Ollier in a paper for Earth Systems and Environment. The paper  Is the Sea Level Stable at Aden, Yemen?  examines the discrepancies between raw and adjusted sea level data in Aden, Karachi and Mumbai. The authors expose how PSMSL data-adjusters make it appear that stable sea levels can be rendered to look like they are nonetheless rising at an accelerated pace. The data-adjusters take misaligned and incomplete sea level data from tide gauges that show no sea level rise (or even a falling trend). Then, they subjectively and arbitrarily cobble them together, or realign them. In each case assessed, PSMSL data-adjusters lower the earlier misaligned rates and raise the more recent measurements. By doing so, they concoct a new linearly-rising trend. Here is a before/after from Karachi: The authors do not mince their words. They refer to these adjustments as highly questionable and suspicious. Thats because they can find no plausible scientific explanation for the adjustments. As they explain at the beginning of their paper, it is hard to put together consistent sea level records covering a long time period. This is because tide gauges are often the result of multiple sets of data, taken over different time periods using different instruments, which are then spliced together. 2017a What is proposed as a single record in databases such as the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) (PSMSL) is often the composition of data collected by different instruments, sometimes in different locations or over different time windows, with significant gaps in between one measurement and the others. This is the case of the Aden, Yemen tide gauge that is the only tidal location of the Arabian Peninsula spanning a time window long enough to infer a trend and acceleration of the relative sea level (assuming there was continuous measurement and no quality issue). In Aden, similar to Karachi and Mumbai and other tide gauges of the area, a single-tide gauge record is the result of multiple sets of data subjectively coupled together. While a new tide gauge is recording since about 2007, the alignment of the previous data is continuously changing. So there is nothing per se wrong with PSMSL making adjustments in order to make the different datasets align. What is wrong is the way that the scientists at PSMSL have adjusted them. In every case, they have revised them in order to make them produce a sharp upward trend in sea level rise  despite the fact that global records do not support this. The truth, Parker and Ollier conclude in their paper, is that sea level has changed very little in the three sites examined:",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/scientists-caught-tampering-raw-data-exaggerate-sea-level-rise/,Science,Snopes
7885,How Google and MSM Use Fact Checkers to Flood Us with Fake Claims |,"Guest essay by Leo Goldstein The Left implemented a novel technique of the Big Lie that I will call a Flooding Fake here. This technique was especially widely used by climate alarmism. This is what it looks like: An important figure or organization on the Left is caught doing something wrong, saying something outrageous, or blatantly lying. The Left injects into public discourse an absolutely fake, but believable, account of this action and immediately debunks this account. The fake narrative is accepted by the public as truth because the public knows that something similar has happened. The immediate debunking is rejected as a cover-up attempt. Later, when people accuse the original wrongdoer they use elements of the fake narrative. This is when fact checkers jump on them. Fake news networks accuse honest statesmen and commentators of spreading fake news. The liberals conviction that the conservatives are stupid and uninformed gets deeper. Google buries honest pieces far from public sight. Facebook tries to prevent their sharing. Leftist politicians cry that they lost elections because of fake news. An example is a global cooling scare of the 70s. In 1977, Time magazine published an issue under the following cover: See (1) and (2). That cover is a seriously inconvenient truth for climate alarmists and their media accessories. So, Time attempted to re-write a history. It published a forged version of its own cover, the left one on the following picture (the Time-2013-version-of-1977): and then easily debunked it as a photoshopped version of its April 2007 cover ( 3 ). As I will explain below, Time magazine knew it was launching a hoax. The rest of the liberal media popularized it, although it could have easily recognized it. Snopes adopted it ( 4 ), invented additional details that were not present in the Time article, and angrily condemned climate deniers. Quotes from Snopes: A rhetorical technique commonly employed by anthropogenic climate change deniers to diminish climate science is to reference fears some scientists had over the prospect of global cooling in the 1970s. One commonly shared pairing, floating around the internet since at least 2013, purports to show two covers of Time Magazine: A 1977 issue  As noted by Time itself in 2013, the 2006 image on the right is an authentic cover, but the 1977 image is a doctored version of an 9 April 2007 issue which actually featured an article titled The Global Warming Survival Guide I dont know when Snopes published that, because Snopes had its history erased from archive.org. Archive.org (that calls itself the Wayback Machine) is an Amazon-owned service that stores copies of web pages and sites for posterity. Some pages and sites are not stored because they are not popular, are forbidden to crawlers, or are hard to save. But Snopes.com has been excluded from the Wayback Machine. Snopes.com is the first website I encounter that has been excluded. That means it has forbidden archive.org to crawl its site and demanded to take down already saved data. That makes sense. Snopes is a fact checker  it checks facts to ensure they match the party line. In such cases, the party line is usually thin and changes frequently, so Snopes does not want 3rd parties to keep the history of changes. Think Orwell, 1984. But everyone who lived through the 70s knows that any climate worries at the time were about cooling, and many know that one 1977 Time issue reflected these worries. Some climate realists googled the cover of that issue, and what they found was a fabrication. Not aware of that, they fell into the trap and posted this fabricated picture as a proof. Even the website of Dr. Roy Spencer fell a victim. Then, climate alarmists had a joyful and profitable time debunking the forgery they and/or their accomplices had created. This trick has been repeated multiple times with other arguments, convincing the majority of onlookers that climate realists are liars or simply ignorant. Trace forward After Snopes finally established this Flooding Fake narrative, the fake-stream media have been giving it the megaphone. Google and, probably, Facebook use it to fact check news and ordinary search results. This is how this looks in Google: archive.org. Snopes is also known to be hyper-partisan, but so is Google, and it might be excused for taking their political alignment as an evidence of objectivity by Snopes. Google also knows that it is a search engine, and fact checking is none of its business. The first Google search result says that Donald Trump is behind the hoax, created by the Time magazine four years ago, and links to a fresh Time article ( 6 ), repeating and amplifying the hoax. A Wikipedia entry ( 7 ) is the second result, and Snopes comes third. Snopes result is fact-checked by Snopes itself. Thus, Google simply cons a user with its fact check. This is a recurrent occurrence, not an exception. Google knows that Snopes is untrustworthy from the fact that Snopes has expunged its history form. Snopes is also known to be hyper-partisan, but so is Google, and it might be excused for taking their political alignment as an evidence of objectivity by Snopes. Google also knows that it is a search engine, and fact checking is none of its business. Of course, this fact-checking by Google and some social media websites is nothing but a political censorship. Google is a monopoly created by the Obama administration through failure to enforce anti-trust laws, and then through subjecting the Internet use of 300 million citizens to the Title II regulation for the benefit of Google and other content providers. I dare to say that through Google, Facebook, and some other hand-picked corporate favorites, the Obama administration attempts to control our speech from the grave. Traceback I guess that climate alarmists launched this specific misinformation operation in response to the Global Cooling Compilation article, published by Anthony in March 2013. The WUWT article featured the correct 1977 Time cover. Time-2013-version-of-1977 picture in ScienceBlogs on June 4, 2013 (A few days ago a facebook friend of mine posted the following image. Two days later, Time magazine published its own piece, which has launched the forged Time-2013-version-of-1977 picture into mass circulation. The piece but gave a nod to Kirtley and ScienceBlogs.

Two days later, Time magazine published its own piece, which has launched the forgedpicture into mass circulation. The piece but gave a nod to Kirtley and ScienceBlogs. Time magazine claimed that the forged picture was found on a page of a linked page on a conservative site called UncommonDescent.com . I cannot say whether that picture was on that site at any time. But by the time the Time article was published, that page on UncommonDescent.com had not a picture, but this text: It turns out the Time magazine cover How to Survive the Coming Ice Age is a photoshopped fake. However, while the cover is a fake, Time was in fact printing stories about fears of global cooling in the 70s. See here. And so was Newsweek. See here. And the National Science Board. See here. And Science. See here. And several other sources summarized here. We regret the error of putting the fake Time cover up. However, the point we were trying to make remains valid. Time-2013-version-of-1977 forgery. It is easy to verify the page on UncommonDescent.com has been saved in archive.org on April 19, 2012: The post is still there and contains links. Its impossible to say from the text whether the photoshopped cover was the same as the one published later by Time. Most important: the post was dated by April 12, 2012  more than a year before Time magazine published itsforgery. It is easy to verify the page on UncommonDescent.com has been saved inon April 19, 2012: _LINKS_ The original source of the fake cover is hard to trace. It is almost certainly somebody in the climate alarmism camp: the real cover from 1977 was very clearly making a point against climate alarmism. But the point of entry of the forgery into mass circulation was Time magazine, June 6 of 2013. Good job, motherf*ckers. Conclusion 1 This is not an outlier, but a repeating pattern. The most damaging case is uncertainties in the predictions of complex climate models. Of course, real scientists, physicists and mathematicians, used to say that there were uncertainties in the predictions of climate models, but only out of politeness. They really meant that those models were bullsh*t. I could not believe such things would gain traction in a free society on such scale, and I still dont believe. It might be that the U.S. was not a free society in the second term of the Obama administration, and that the remnants of the Obama regime have been in #resistance since the unexpected defeat in the elections. Conclusion 2 In the next two days, a Google lawyer will speak to the Senate Intelligence Committee and will attempt to steer its attention to a non-existent Russian collusion. He or she will lie and present cherry-picked or outright fabricated evidence. If the government wants to know the truth about extent to which Google aided foreign powers to interfere in the US elections and politics, it should not listen to Google representatives, but to send FBI to physically enter Googles premises, to copy all of its code and data, and to start interrogating executives and sysadmins (after obtaining an appropriate court order, of course). Remarks In this example, multiple entities are involved: Google, Snopes, Time magazine, and ScienceBlogs. They are independent entities, but each of them knowingly plays its own well-defined role in the chain of injection, amplification, propagation, and utilization of a lie. Thus, they might be referred to as a single body. The Flooding Fake is different from a strawman fallacy. The Flooding Fake is a political operation, rather than a fallacy. Accordingly, in a strawman fallacy, the strawman is not disseminated outside of the original debate, and does not convince the opponent. The Flooding Fake is disseminated very broadly and eventually takes over some opponents. The Flooding Fake is related to two other PR techniques of the left: fake opponents (like fossil fuels interests), and fake debate subject. Another example of the Flooding Fake at work is the funny meme Al Gore  the inventor of the Internet. In fact, Al Gore pretended to be much more, almost a Creator of the Internet [link]. I did not check who was the first to utter that meme. It might have been a misspeaking analyst or politician on the right. But the first source does not matter because it is not broadly read or viewed, if at all. What matter is who injected the fake meme into the broad circulation.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/time-magazine-cover-global-cooling/,Science,Snopes
7946,Fatalities at wind turbines may threaten population viability of a migratory bat,"Large numbers of migratory bats are killed every year at wind energy facilities. However, population-level impacts are unknown as we lack basic demographic information about these species. We investigated whether fatalities at wind turbines could impact population viability of migratory bats, focusing on the hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus), the species most frequently killed by turbines in North America. Using expert elicitation and population projection models, we show that mortality from wind turbines may drastically reduce population size and increase the risk of extinction. For example, the hoary bat population could decline by as much as 90% in the next 50 years if the initial population size is near 2.5 million bats and annual population growth rate is similar to rates estimated for other bat species ( = 1.01). Our results suggest that wind energy development may pose a substantial threat to migratory bats in North America. If viable populations are to be sustained, conservation measures to reduce mortality from turbine collisions likely need to be initiated soon. Our findings inform policy decisions regarding preventing or mitigating impacts of energy infrastructure development on wildlife.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/400-papers-published-in-2017-prove-that-global-warming-is-myth/,Science,Snopes

8060,Small Asteroid Is Earth's Constant Companion,"A small asteroid has been discovered in an orbit around the sun that keeps it as a constant companion of Earth, and it will remain so for centuries to come. As it orbits the sun, this new asteroid, designated 2016 HO3, appears to circle around Earth as well. It is too distant to be considered a true satellite of our planet, but it is the best and most stable example to date of a near-Earth companion, or ""quasi-satellite."" ""Since 2016 HO3 loops around our planet, but never ventures very far away as we both go around the sun, we refer to it as a quasi-satellite of Earth,"" said Paul Chodas, manager of NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object (NEO) Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. ""One other asteroid -- 2003 YN107 -- followed a similar orbital pattern for a while over 10 years ago, but it has since departed our vicinity. This new asteroid is much more locked onto us. Our calculations indicate 2016 HO3 has been a stable quasi-satellite of Earth for almost a century, and it will continue to follow this pattern as Earth's companion for centuries to come."" In its yearly trek around the sun, asteroid 2016 HO3 spends about half of the time closer to the sun than Earth and passes ahead of our planet, and about half of the time farther away, causing it to fall behind. Its orbit is also tilted a little, causing it to bob up and then down once each year through Earth's orbital plane. In effect, this small asteroid is caught in a game of leap frog with Earth that will last for hundreds of years. The asteroid's orbit also undergoes a slow, back-and-forth twist over multiple decades. ""The asteroid's loops around Earth drift a little ahead or behind from year to year, but when they drift too far forward or backward, Earth's gravity is just strong enough to reverse the drift and hold onto the asteroid so that it never wanders farther away than about 100 times the distance of the moon,"" said Chodas. ""The same effect also prevents the asteroid from approaching much closer than about 38 times the distance of the moon. In effect, this small asteroid is caught in a little dance with Earth."" Asteroid 2016 HO3 was first spotted on April 27, 2016, by the Pan-STARRS 1 asteroid survey telescope on Haleakala, Hawaii, operated by the University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy and funded by NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office. The size of this object has not yet been firmly established, but it is likely larger than 120 feet (40 meters) and smaller than 300 feet (100 meters).

13997,Flushing out an equatorial fraud,"On Twitter recently, I saw the following tweet: Phil Plait Phil Plait writes Slates Bad Astronomy blog and is an astronomer, public speaker, science evangelizer, and author of Death From the Skies! Advertisement [That tweet was from Minute Physics, a great channel on YouTube which does very short, informative, and fun animated physics videos.] Intrigued, I clicked the link and watched this video. I describe it below. [You may have to refresh the page to get the video to load; if you see a blank spot beneath this then refresh.] Advertisement Amazing, right? Not really. It's totally bogus! And I'm happy to explain how. Advertisement Spinning the truth Here's the deal. The trick plays on the idea that people think water will drain (or flush in a toilet) one way north of the equator, and the other way south. Most people know hurricanes rotate one way (counterclockwise) in the north and the other (clockwise) in the south, so there's some basis for this. The reason cyclones spin opposite ways in opposite hemispheres is due to the Coriolis effect, which I've explained in detail both on this blog and on my old website. Read those explanations first if you'd like, but you don't need to understand the Coriolis effect in detail here. All you need to know is that over the size of a water basin, the Coriolis force has no effect. I mean it: none. Any random eddy or movement of water in the basin is hugely more important than the teeny tiny effect of the rotating Earth on the basin. Advertisement Brain drain So how does this work then? Watch the guy working the ruse carefully. First he goes through a show of finding north, and locating the position of the Equator. This is all simply for show. As you'll see in a second, this exact trick will work anywhere, not just on the Equator. I could do it in Boulder, at a latitude of 40 north! Advertisement He goes first to a basin on the Equator. It's already filled, and the video jumped right before that, so I don't know if he filled it right before draining it, or if it was sitting there for a while already filled. My guess is it had the water sitting for awhile -- you'll see why in a second. When he pulls out the plug the water drains straight down. OK. He then grabs the basin and bucket and moves a few meters south. Watch very carefully what happens then: he pours the water from a bucket, making sure the water is flowing in to the left of the drain hole: I've noted with an arrow where the plug is, and where he's pouring the bucket. When he does this, it sets up a natural clockwise spin to the water overall; it hits the back of the basin and will flow to the right from there. At least some of the people around him don't notice this, though, since you can hear them talking excitedly about it. Now watch again starting at 1:40 when he moves the basin to the north of the Equator. It's hard to see, but you do very certainly see him pouring the water to the right of the drain hole: See? That naturally sets up a counterclockwise rotation to the water! It has nothing to do with where the basin is; if he swapped the two locations but still poured to either side of the drain hole, the water would do exactly the same thing! As for the water in the basin on the Equator, that's why I think it was sitting for awhile first: he probably filled it carefully so there was no circular motion of the water. That way, when it drains, it drains straight down. Flushed away One thing I want to point out here: that guy knows exactly what he's doing. He has to, to make it work. So at the very least, this is a trick. If he's asking for money, though, and not explaining it, then in my opinion it's just plain old fraud. Of course it's not like he's the first guy to take advantage of tourists! Caveat emptor, of course. But then, caveat venditor, too. Because there are folks like me who are fond of lux et veritas*. My point is simply this: it's easy to fool people, and it's really easy to fool them if they already have some vague knowledge of how things are ""supposed"" to be. By coincidence, my friend James Randi wrote about this very topic for Wired magazine recently. It's worth a read. I'll note -- speaking of separating people from their money -- that I have a whole chapter in my book Bad Astronomy debunking exactly this type of thing, though the person in the example I used had a slightly different technique. But the bottom line is this: for hurricanes and shooting cannon and launching missiles, yeah, the Coriolis effect is important. For draining sinks and flushing toilets, though, it's all a matter of spin. Tip o' the cyclone to Minute Physics.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/coriolis-effect/,Science,Snopes
516,United States health care facilities face an intravenous bag shortage because of the devastation wreaked by Hurricane Maria in September 2017.,"SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO ��� When things went bad during Hurricane Maria, they went bad all at once, across this entire island. Suddenly, everything was dysfunctional, including the power grid, the cellphone towers, the banking system. Even the disaster managers, the professionals in charge of responding to hurricanes, were forced to evacuate the buildings where they had sheltered during the powerful storm.

They shifted operations to the convention center here, an improvised maneuver that was just one of the reasons the government struggled to meet the challenges Maria presented. They were in the dark. The island���s residents were in the dark. No one knew the extent of what had happened ��� or what was happening ��� for days.

���Everything collapsed,��� said H��ctor Pesquera, the Puerto Rico governor���s director of safety and public protection. ���Everything collapsed simultaneously.���

Nearly two weeks after Maria caused a historic catastrophe and thrust Puerto Rico into a humanitarian crisis, President Trump on Tuesday is scheduled to make his first visit to the island since the storm hit on Sept. 20.

Trump is expected to meet with Gov. Ricardo Rossell��, who has repeatedly expressed appreciation for federal support from Washington. It is unclear whether Trump will encounter San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul��n Cruz, who has sharply criticized the federal effort, saying that Puerto Ricans are dying while the nation���s bureaucracy stumbles.

Trump has tweeted attacks on Cruz���s leadership, and the president has repeatedly said that stories highlighting the slow response to the crisis are fake news.

Watch aerial views of damaged Guajataca dam in Puerto Rico

That view was echoed, if in a more subtle way, by the Federal Emergency Management Agency���s administrator on Monday after he flew to the island and, as he told reporters, saw signs of civic vibrancy in San Juan. William ���Brock��� Long said he managed to get a cellphone signal when he was 20 minutes outside the capital and heading to a remote area.

���As we were going down the road, I saw numerous fuel trucks with security, I saw numerous water trucks with security,��� he said. ���I saw a lot of resilient Puerto Ricans. I saw neighbors helping neighbors. I didn���t see anybody in a life-threatening situation at all.���

[Trapped in the mountains, Puerto Ricans don���t see help, or a way out]

The statutory requirements and protocols of disaster management are complex. The Defense Department has authority to send some of its assets where it sees fit, and in the case of Hurricane Maria did not initially deploy as many ships, sailors and soldiers as it could have. But the Defense Department is supposed to support, and follow the guidance of, FEMA. FEMA, in turn, is supposed to support the local and state (and in this case, territory) government.

Political sensitivities enter the calculation ��� with governors invariably wanting to show command and control ��� as was the case with Rossell��, who on Thursday took pains to say that the government of Puerto Rico is fully in charge of the Maria disaster response.

���The last thing a political leader wants to admit is that the problem is beyond their control,��� said retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, who played a critical role in the federal responses to Hurricane Katrina and the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. ���There has to be a frank, unvarnished conversation about the scope of the problem and how to deal with it. It is politically hard but operationally essential.���

Even before Maria, Puerto Rico had been hobbling along economically amid a financial crisis and at the same time convulsing politically. Now comes the longer-term question of whether the island can rebuild its economy and stave off wholesale flight of its residents to the mainland.

Rossell��, trying to steer attention toward the broader issues facing Puerto Rico, said on Sunday: ���I invite you to reflect on why Puerto Rico is in the current state of disadvantage and inequality. It���s not something that happened just a few months or few weeks before this storm. It is a condition that has happened for more than a century in Puerto Rico. .���.���. I invite you to reflect on the reality that even after the storm hit Puerto Rico, even when it was evident that it was a disaster in the United States, only half of our U.S. citizens knew that Puerto Ricans were U.S. citizens.���

Rosell�� and other officials have not denied that the government struggled to provide food, water, medicine and fuel in the wake of Maria, but they have pointed to the challenges of being an island 1,000 miles from the mainland, as well as the communication breakdowns they experienced.

The scale of the disaster became clear only when mayors from across the island arrived in San Juan on Sept. 23, three days after the storm, for a meeting at the convention center at which they delivered dire reports in person. The U.S. government did not ramp up all of its capabilities until six days had passed. Last Tuesday, the Pentagon dispatched an Army one-star general to the island and then quickly elevated that command by sending in a three-star general.

[���If anyone can hear us .���.���. help.��� Puerto Rico���s mayors describe widespread devastation from Hurricane Maria]

���Every day we get more and more situational awareness,��� said John Rabin, the acting administrator for the FEMA division that oversees Puerto Rico. ���As soon as we recognized there was a need for more resources and more capability, we ordered up that proverbial bigger boat.���

Asked if the response was slow, he went silent for a few beats.

���It���s not that it was ���slow���; it���s ���complex,��� is the way I would describe it,��� Rabin said.

He cited one example of the way the response is evolving: FEMA and the Puerto Rico emergency managers sent relief supplies to 11 locations around the island. But the lack of communication meant that many people were not showing up for the supplies. Officials since have been using military helicopters to carry aid to rural locations.

The difficulty in responding to Maria has revealed how unique each disaster is ��� and how resistant to a one-size-fits-all approach. Hurricane Harvey, for example, created a flooding disaster in Houston and other cities in southern Texas, and thousands of people had to be rescued from their homes, often by civilians using private boats.

For Maria, numerous Coast Guard and FEMA urban-search-and-rescue teams were on hand or arrived quickly. But it soon became clear that what people needed most were life-sustaining provisions ��� including water, food and diesel fuel for generators ��� that the search-and-rescue teams didn���t have.

Senior officials in the Pentagon debated sending additional assistance in the first few days after the storm, including deploying a 1,000-bed hospital ship, the USNS Comfort, under their own authority. They decided instead to fill requests from the Puerto Rico government to send a couple of 50-bed hospital units that could be set up on shore.

Long visited Puerto Rico last Monday, and afterward the Pentagon���s effort changed. The next day Long appeared at the White House and announced the deployment of the Comfort.

Several U.S. military officials with knowledge of Puerto Rico operations said afterward that they hadn���t known about the ship���s deployment. The Comfort was not yet ready to sail.

Military officials said they have filled every request they have received in a timely fashion. The Navy had two amphibious combat ships, the USS Kearsarge and the USS Oak Hill, already in the region in response to Hurricane Irma, and after maneuvering to avoid Maria they sailed to Puerto Rico with a complement of Marines and sailors aboard. The Coast Guard had at least nine ships off the Puerto Rico coast shortly after the storm.

The unpredictable path of the storm played a role in the decision to send some ships, notably the USS Iwo Jima and USS New York, to ports on the mainland rather than to Puerto Rico in advance of Maria, the officials said. When pressed, they acknowledged that the ships could have steered clear of the storm while at sea and responded to the storm sooner.

As of Monday, there were 10 Army helicopters, 17 Navy and Marine Corps helicopters, and 10 National Guard helicopters involved in the Maria response, with an additional 12 Army Black Hawk helicopters and four MV-22 Osprey arriving soon, the Pentagon said.

Angela Fritz, The Washington Post���s deputy weather editor, confirmed this phenomenon is real and may occur during extremely powerful hurricanes such as Irma. The storm is so powerful, it can essentially change the shape of the ocean, Fritz said.
���Basically, Hurricane Irma is so strong and its pressure is so low, it���s sucking water from its surroundings into the core of the storm,��� Fritz wrote.
���In the center of the storm, where there is extreme low pressure, water is drawn upward. Low pressure is basically a sucking mechanism ��� it sucks the air into it, and when it���s really low, it can change the shape of the surface of the ocean. As the storm draws water toward the center, it gets pulled away from the surroundings.���
Wayne Neely, a forecaster with the Bahamas��� Department of Meteorology, warned residents of Long Island and Exuma, where water had also reportedly receded from the beaches, to be careful as the ocean returned back to high levels.
���Care must be taken in this case because the water often returns with even greater fury,��� Neely said in a Facebook post explaining the phenomenon.

708,Can the FireChat App Send Messages Without an Internet Connection?,"FireChat makes use of a feature Apple introduced in the latest version of its iOS mobile software, iOS7, called multipeer connectivity. This feature allows phones to connect to one another directly using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi as an alternative to the Internet. If you���re using FireChat, its ���nearby��� chat room lets you exchange messages with other users within 100 feet without sending data via your cellular provider.

Micha Benoliel, CEO and cofounder of startup Open Garden, which made FireChat, says the app shows how smartphones can be set free from cellular networks. He hopes to enable many more Internet-optional apps with the upcoming release of software tools that will help developers build FireChat-style apps for iPhone, or for Android, Mac, and Windows devices. ���This approach is very interesting for multiplayer gaming and all kinds of communication apps,��� says Benoliel.

Anthony DiPasquale, a developer with consultancy Thoughtbot, says FireChat is the only app he���s aware of that���s been built to make use of multipeer connectivity, perhaps because the feature remains unfamiliar to most Apple developers. ���I hope more people start to use it soon,��� he says. ���It���s an awesome framework with a lot of potential. There is probably a great use for multipeer connectivity in every situation where there are people grouped together wanting to share some sort of information.��� DiPasquale has dabbled in using multipeer connectivity himself, creating an experimental app that streams music from one device to several others nearby.

The new feature of iOS7 currently only supports data moving directly from one device to another, and from one device to several others. However, Open Garden���s forthcoming software will extend the feature so that data can hop between two iPhones out of range of one another via intermediary devices. That approach, known as mesh networking, is at the heart of several existing projects to create disaster-proof or community-controlled communications networks (see ���Build Your Own Internet with Mobile Mesh Networking���).

Apps built to exploit such device-to-device schemes can offer security and privacy benefits over those that rely on the Internet. For example, messages sent using FireChat to nearby devices don���t pass through any systems operated by either Open Garden or a wireless carrier (although they are broadcast to all FireChat users nearby).

That means the content of a message and metadata could not be harvested from a central communications hub by an attacker or government agency. ���This method of communication is immune to firewalls like the ones installed in China and North Korea,��� says Mattt Thompson, a software engineer who writes the iOS and Mac development blog NSHipster. Recent revelations about large-scale surveillance of online services and the constant litany of data breaches make this a good time for apps that don���t rely on central servers, he says. ���As users become more mindful of the security and privacy implications of technologies they rely on, moving in the direction of local, ad-hoc networking makes a lot of sense.���

However, peer-to-peer and mesh networking apps also come with their own risks, since an eavesdropper could gain access to local traffic just by using a device within range.

Open Garden���s main product is an app that allows Android devices to share their Internet connections (see ���Could You Spare Some Internet Access?���). However, Benoliel says that won���t be coming to the iPhone anytime soon because the feature that FireChat relies on cannot be used to share data connectivity.

Peer-to-peer mobile communications and mesh networks could prove especially important in countries with minimal communications infrastructure. ���You can see Google spending billions on fiber and balloons, but this is not going to solve the problem of ubiquitous mobile connectivity,��� Benoliel says. He argues that the spread of cheap Android phones across the world will make mesh networking feasible. ���We need to create small Internets that can function on their own and [then] connect them to the big Internet.���",TRUE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/can-firechat-send-messages-without-internet/,Science,Snopes
783,Is a Wisconsin Company Offering to Microchip its Employees?,"A Wisconsin company is to become the first in the US to microchip employees.

Three Square Market is offering to implant the tiny radio-frequency identification (RFID) chip into workers' hands for free - and says everyone will soon be doing it.

The rice grain-sized $300 (��230) chip will allow them to open doors, log in to computers and even purchase food.

And so far, 50 employees have signed up for the chance to become half-human, half-walking credit card.

But far from being some sort of dystopian nightmare, Three Square Market's Patrick McMullan believes everyone will soon be wanting their own microchip.

What does it feel like? BBC reporter gets chipped
""The international market place is wide open and we believe that the future trajectory of total market share is going to be driven by whoever captures this arena first,"" Mr McMullan said.


The company, which provides self-service ""micro markets"" to businesses around the world, was inspired by the micro-chipping already taking place in Sweden, where so-called ""bio-hackers"" have been inserting the tiny devices into willing participants for at least three years.

Three Square Market are even working with a Swedish company, BioHax, to deliver the new technology, which they see as one day being simply another payment and identification method - only instead of a credit card or phone, there would be a microchip between your thumb and finger.

But how did employees react?
While a large proportion of the world might think twice before putting a tiny chip in their hand, it seems those at Three Square Market had no such worries.

Out of 85 employees at the company's head office, 50 have come forward, vice-president of international development Tony Danna told the BBC.

""The people that wanted it were like yes, no hesitation,"" he said.

Can they be tracked?
""That is going to be the inevitable reaction,"" Mr Danna acknowledged.

""But there is no GPS tracking ability to it. It is really the same thing as the chip that is in your credit card.""

How does it go in - and how do you get it out?
The entire point of the chip is convenience, Mr Danna explained.

Eventually, he hopes it will replace everything you might have in your wallet - from your key fob to your credit card and ID. For now, it is just aiming to make life easier for those using Three Square Market's facilities.

But the convenience also stretches to installing and removing the chip.

""It takes about two seconds to put it in and to take it out,"" he told the BBC. Putting it in is ""like getting a shot"" using a syringe, while taking it out it like removing a splinter.

""Easy in, easy out,"" Mr Danna said.

What if you get robbed?
Like everything in life, it could happen.

But, says Mr Danna, at least it is all in one place, making it easier to cancel all those cards.",TRUE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/three-square-market-microchip/,Science,Snopes
8245,Is Fentanyl-Laced Marijuana Use on the Rise?,"CINCINNATI, OH (WLWT) ��� Synthetic opiates like fentanyl have been found in marijuana, Hamilton County Coroner Dr. Lakshmi Sammarco confirmed to NBC affiliate WLWT-TV Monday.

Fentanyl, a drug 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine, has been linked to a surge of fatal overdoses across the county. It has been showing up in other drugs across the area.

���We have seen fentanyl mixed with cocaine, we have also seen fentanyl mixed with marijuana,��� Sammarco said during a joint press conference with Sen. Rob Portman.

Sammarco said that there have already been 297 deaths in Hamilton County this year caused by suspected opioid overdose, compared to 403 confirmed deaths in all of 2016.

She did not specify how many cases involved marijuana mixed with a synthetic opiate.

���Essentially, the message we���ve tried to get out there, is if you are using any form of street drugs, count on them having some form of synthetic opioid mixed in,��� Samarco said.

Samarco added that it is nearly impossible to tell which drugs are mixed with a synthetic opiate.

���We can���t tell you for sure until we test the blood of someone who has died or any of the drugs seized by law enforcement,��� she added.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/fentanyl-laced-marijuana-rise/,Science,Snopes
8455,A major Hepatitis A outbreak in San Diego has been pinned on undocumented immigrants there.,"Dean James AMERICA���S FREEDOM FIGHTERS���
The ultra liberal city of San Diego, California which incidentally is inundated with illegal aliens is facing a health crisis and authorities have declared PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY.
A public health emergency was declared Friday over an outbreak of ���hepatitis A��� that has been linked to at least 15 deaths and 400 hospitalizations.
The liver disease outbreak started last November, with the homeless population affected most. The emergency declaration will help the city access state funds and provide legal protection for new sanitation measures, the Union-Tribune reported.
Areas with high concentrations of homeless people will receive roughly 40 portable hand-washing stations to help combat the disease, which can spread through fecal matter when people fail to thoroughly clean their hands after using the restroom.
Crews also plan to use bleach-spiked water for high-pressure washing to remove ���all feces, blood, bodily fluids or contaminated surfaces,��� according to a sanitation plan outlined in a letter Thursday.
Other cities in the region can expect to see similar hand-washing and street-sanitizing efforts, said Dr. Wilma Wooten, the region���s public health officer, FOX News reported.
After previous vaccination and educational programs failed to significantly reduce the infection rate, and with death reports spiking in recent weeks, San Diego decided to mimic a campaign used in Los Angeles, which is home to tens of thousands of homeless, in an attempt to curb the outbreak.
���We know that L.A. has had no local cases of hepatitis A related to the strain that we���re seeing here in San Diego,��� Wooten said. ���If they���re doing it there and they haven���t had any cases, it could be beneficial here as well.���
The moves in San Diego follow finger-pointing between city and county officials, with both sides insisting they were doing the best they could under tough circumstances, the newspaper said.
���There is no precedent for this,��� Wooten said. ���We will definitely have a playbook for if we have something like this in the future. But this is the first time we have had something of this nature happen.���

These kind of problems are typical in liberal cities.
Build the wall.

0,Congress takes up controversy over 5G service near airports,"Lawmakers wondered aloud Thursday how a showdown between two federal agencies over the rollout of new high-speed wireless service reached crisis proportions last month, but they were short on answers to a dispute that raised concerns about interference with key equipment on planes.

Some flights have been canceled since Verizon and AT&T turned on their new networks last month, but predictions of widespread cancellations turned out to be wrong. The Federal Aviation Administration has cleared 90% of the nation���s airline fleet to land during poor visibility at airports near 5G cell towers.

Those approvals are being made each month, plane by plane, based on the model of radio altimeter that they use to measure their height above the ground. Some ���lower-performing��� planes are still restricted, and a permanent fix for the entire fleet is likely at least a year away, FAA Administrator Stephen Dickson said during a hearing of the House aviation subcommittee.

The CEOs of American Airlines and United Airlines have said they don���t expect any more disruptions. However, more than half of the planes operated by regional airlines remain restricted during bad weather, said Faye Malarkey Black, president of a trade group for the smaller carriers, some of which operate flights for American Eagle, United Express and Delta Connection.

Congress takes up controversy over 5G service near airports
Black said cancellations are still occurring, and more than one-fourth of flights at the three major airports in the New York City areas are operated by smaller planes that can���t land there during bad weather because of restrictions related to 5G.

Verizon and AT&T agreed to two delays before launching most of their planned new 5G service on Jan. 19 except near airports, where they agreed not to turn on new cell towers for the time being.

Dozens of flights were canceled because of 5G concerns after the services went live, but widespread cancellations were avoided.

The current, temporary fix came after the White House stepped to settle a lack of cooperation between the FAA and the Federal Communications Commission that threatened to create massive disruptions for airlines and passengers.

Rep. John Katko, R-N.Y., told Dickson that FAA���s last-minute directives about operating around 5G indicates ���that you really didn���t have a plan and didn���t understand the gravity of the situation ahead of time.���

Dickson said FAA couldn���t authorize low-visibility flights near the new signals until it got information from the telecom companies about the location, height and power of their 5G towers.

House Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., blamed the FCC, which approved plans by Verizon and AT&T to launch faster and more reliable 5G service using the C-Band part of the radio spectrum that is close to the range used by altimeters, which are critical for landing in poor visibility.

DeFazio said he and aviation interests raised concerns about possible interference for several years, but the FCC ignored them and auctioned off 5G spectrum without ensuring there would be no interference with aviation.

���Having a dropped call is way less serious than having a dropped airplane,��� he said.

The FCC has said it provided enough buffer between C-Band and radio altimeters to prevent interference.

FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel was invited to testify but had a conflict, according to an agency spokesman, who declined to describe the conflict. He said that Rosenworcel spoke separately on Wednesday with DeFazio and the chairman of the aviation subcommittee, Rep. Rick Larsen, D-Wash.

The FCC and the telecom companies say that 40 other countries have rolled out C-Band 5G service without any reports of radio interference with planes. Aviation groups say those countries have lower-power 5G signals or impose other restrictions on the service to prevent interference, a claim that is disputed by the telecom industry.",TRUE,https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-telecommunications-transportation-federal-aviation-administration-94a3f92cf9a6f8d17874427c9a6a9b4b,Science,AP
0,Tesla recall: ���Full Self-Driving��� software runs stop signs,"DETROIT (AP) ��� Tesla is recalling nearly 54,000 cars and SUVs because their ���Full Self-Driving��� software lets them roll through stop signs without coming to a complete halt.

Recall documents posted Tuesday by U.S. safety regulators say that Tesla will disable the feature with an over-the-internet software update. The ���rolling stop��� feature allows vehicles to go through intersections with all-way stop signs at up to 5.6 miles (9 kilometers) per hour.

The recall shows that Tesla programmed its vehicles to violate the law in most states, where police will ticket drivers for disregarding stop signs. The Governors Highway Safety Association, which represents state highway safety offices, said it is not aware of any state where a rolling stop is legal.

Tesla agreed to the recall after two meetings with officials from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, according to documents. Tesla said in documents that it knows of no crashes or injuries caused by feature.

The recall covers Model S sedans and X SUVs from 2016 through 2022, as well as 2017 to 2022 Model 3 sedans and 2020 through 2022 Model Y SUVs.

Selected Tesla drivers are ���beta testing��� the ���Full Self-Driving��� software on public roads. The company says the cars cannot drive themselves and drivers must be ready to take action at all times.

A firmware release to disable the rolling stops is expected to be sent out in early February.

Tesla, which disbanded its media relations department, did not comment Tuesday.

NHTSA says failing to stop for a sign can increase the risk of a crash. ���The Vehicle Safety Act prohibits manufacturers from selling vehicles with defects posing unreasonable risks to safety, including intentional design choices that are unsafe,��� the agency said. ���If the information shows that a safety risk may exist, NHTSA will act immediately.���

Tesla introduced the ���rolling stop��� feature in a software update that was sent out to the testing owners on Oct. 20, 2020. NHTSA met with Tesla on Jan. 10 and 19 this year to discuss how the software operates, the documents said. On Jan. 20, the company agreed to disable the rolling stops with the software update.

The ���rolling stop��� feature let the Teslas go through all-way stop signs as long as the owner enabled the function. The vehicles have to be traveling below 5.6 mph while approaching the intersection, and no ���relevant��� moving cars, pedestrians or bicyclists can be detected nearby. All roads leading to the intersection had to have speed limits of 30 mph or less, the documents said. The Teslas would then be allowed to go through the intersection at 0.1 mph to 5.6 mph without coming to a complete stop.

Philip Koopman, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, said 4-way stop signs are commonly placed to protect intersections for children when no crossing guard is present. He said Tesla���s ���machine learning��� system can mistakenly identify objects. ���What happens when FSD decides a child crossing the street is not ���relevant��� and fails to stop?��� he asked. ���This is an unsafe behavior and should never have been put in vehicles.���

Koopman said traveling through a stop sign at 5.6 mph is akin to treating it as a yield sign.

Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the governors safety association, said he���s not surprised that Tesla programmed vehicles to violate state laws. ���They keep pushing the bounds of safety to see what they can get away with, and they���ve really been pushing a lot,��� he said. ���Each time it���s just a little bit more egregious. It���s good to see NHTSA is pushing back.���

The automaker should make safety a priority ���not taking advantage of some of our worst behaviors on the road,��� Adkins said.

In November, NHTSA said it was looking into a complaint from a California Tesla driver that the ���Full Self-Driving��� software caused a crash. The driver complained to the agency that a Model Y went into the wrong lane and was hit by another vehicle. The SUV gave the driver an alert halfway through the turn, and the driver tried to turn the wheel to avoid other traffic, according to the complaint. But the car took control and ���forced itself into the incorrect lane,��� the driver reported. No one was hurt in the Nov. 3 crash.

In December, Tesla agreed to update its software to prevent video games from being played on center touch screens while its vehicles are moving.

NHTSA also is investigating why Teslas using the company���s less-sophisticated ���Autopilot��� driver-assist system have repeatedly crashed into emergency vehicles parked on roadways.

Last week Tesla said in its earnings release that ���Full Self-Driving��� software is now being tested by owners in nearly 60,000 vehicles in the U.S. It was only about 2,000 in the third quarter. The software, which costs $12,000, will accelerate Tesla���s profitability, the company said.

CEO Elon Musk said he���d be shocked if the software can���t drive more safely than humans this year. In 2019, Musk predicted a fleet of autonomous Tesla robotaxis on the roads by the end of 2020.

0,IBM partners with Canadian province of Quebec in quantum computing push,"MONTREAL, Feb 3 (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) is partnering with the Canadian province of Quebec to boost quantum computing in a collaboration that could help advance areas like battery development, a company official said on Thursday.

IBM is deploying the quantum computer known as IBM Quantum System One in Canada for the first time, which is expected to be available for use at its facility in Bromont, Quebec by early 2023, Anthony Annunziata, IBM's director of accelerated discovery, said in an interview.

The partnership with Quebec would integrate quantum computing with cloud technologies, high-performance computing and artificial intelligence (AI) to tackle broader challenges like the environment.

""Batteries are very tough to build and improve. We've been working on them for decades and progress is slow, incremental,"" he said.

""If we bring AI and quantum into the picture, that can start to change and we can actually start to understand what's happening at the heart of batteries and understand new materials and new processes to build much better ones.""

The United States and other nations are in a race to develop quantum technology, which could fuel advances in artificial intelligence, materials science and chemistry.

Quantum computers could operate millions of times faster than today's advanced supercomputers.

The technology is based on quantum bits, or qubits, that can be 'superposed' on each other, exponentially increasing the amount of information that can be processed.

0,EXCLUSIVE iPhone flaw exploited by second Israeli spy firm-sources,"WASHINGTON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - A flaw in Apple's software exploited by Israeli surveillance firm NSO Group to break into iPhones in 2021 was simultaneously abused by a competing company, according to five people familiar with the matter.

QuaDream, the sources said, is a smaller and lower profile Israeli firm that also develops smartphone hacking tools intended for government clients.

The two rival businesses gained the same ability last year to remotely break into iPhones, according to the five sources, meaning that both firms could compromise Apple phones without an owner needing to open a malicious link. That two firms employed the same sophisticated hacking technique ��� known as a ���zero-click��� ��� shows that phones are more vulnerable to powerful digital spying tools than the industry will admit, one expert said.

""People want to believe they're secure, and phone companies want you to believe they're secure. What we've learned is, they're not,"" said Dave Aitel, a partner at Cordyceps Systems, a cybersecurity firm.

Experts analyzing intrusions engineered by NSO Group and QuaDream since last year believe the two companies used very similar software exploits, known as ForcedEntry, to hijack iPhones.

An exploit is computer code designed to leverage a set of specific software vulnerabilities, giving a hacker unauthorized access to data.

The analysts believed NSO and QuaDream's exploits were similar because they leveraged many of the same vulnerabilities hidden deep inside Apple's instant messaging platform and used a comparable approach to plant malicious software on targeted devices, according to three of the sources.

Bill Marczak, a security researcher with digital watchdog Citizen Lab who has been studying both companies' hacking tools, told Reuters that QuaDream's zero-click capability seemed ""on par"" with NSO's.

Reuters made repeated attempts to reach QuaDream for comment, sending messages to executives and business partners. A Reuters journalist last week visited QuaDream���s office, in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan, but no one answered the door. Israeli lawyer Vibeke Dank, whose email was listed on QuaDream's corporate registration form, also did not return repeated messages.

An Apple spokesman declined to comment on QuaDream or say what if any action they planned to take with regard to the company.

ForcedEntry is viewed as ""one of the most technically sophisticated exploits"" ever captured by security researchers.

So similar were the two versions of ForcedEntry that when Apple fixed the underlying flaws in September 2021 it rendered both NSO and QuaDream���s spy software ineffective, according to two people familiar with the matter.

In a written statement, an NSO spokeswoman said the company ""did not cooperate"" with QuaDream but that ""the cyber intelligence industry continues to grow rapidly globally.""

Apple sued NSO Group over ForcedEntry in November, claiming that NSO had violated Apple's user terms and services agreement. The case is still in its early stages.

In its lawsuit, Apple said that it ""continuously and successfully fends off a variety of hacking attempts."" NSO has denied any wrongdoing.

Spyware companies have long argued they sell high-powered technology to help governments thwart national security threats. But human rights groups and journalists have repeatedly documented the use of spyware to attack civil society, undermine political opposition, and interfere with elections.

Apple notified thousands of ForcedEntry targets in November, making elected officials, journalists, and human rights workers around the world realize they had been placed under surveillance.

In Uganda, for example, NSO's ForcedEntry was used to spy on U.S. diplomats, Reuters reported.

In addition to the Apple lawsuit, Meta's WhatsApp is also litigating over the alleged abuse of its platform. In November, NSO was put on a trade blacklist by the U.S. Commerce Department over human rights concerns. read more

Unlike NSO, QuaDream has kept a lower profile despite serving some of the same government clients. The company has no website touting its business and employees have been told to keep any reference to their employer off social media, according to a person familiar with the company.

REIGN

QuaDream was founded in 2016 by Ilan Dabelstein, a former Israeli military official, and by two former NSO employees, Guy Geva and Nimrod Reznik, according to Israeli corporate records and two people familiar with the business. Reuters could not reach the three executives for comment.

Like NSO's Pegasus spyware, QuaDream's flagship product - called REIGN - could take control of a smartphone, scooping up instant messages from services such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal, as well as emails, photos, texts and contacts, according to two product brochures from 2019 and 2020 which were reviewed by Reuters.

REIGN's ���Premium Collection��� capabilities included the ""real time call recordings"", ""camera activation - front and back"" and ""microphone activation"", one brochure said.

Prices appeared to vary. One QuaDream system, which would have given customers the ability to launch 50 smartphone break-ins per year, was being offered for $2.2 million exclusive of maintenance costs, according to the 2019 brochure. Two people familiar with the software's sales said the price for REIGN was typically higher.

Over the years, QuaDream and NSO Group employed some of the same engineering talent, according to three people familiar with the matter. Two of those sources said the companies did not collaborate on their iPhone hacks, coming up with their own ways to take advantage of vulnerabilities.

Several of QuaDream's buyers have also overlapped with NSO's, four of the sources said, including Saudi Arabia and Mexico - both of whom have been accused of misusing spy software to target political opponents.

One of QuaDream's first clients was the Singaporean government, two of the sources said, and documentation reviewed by Reuters shows the company's surveillance technology was pitched to the Indonesian government as well. Reuters couldn't determine if Indonesia became a client.

0,Short-Staffed U.S. Hospitals Using Green Card Boom to Hire Foreign Nurses,"ith many U.S. hospitals experiencing a nursing shortage due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some are hoping to bring foreign nurses in to help after many green cards went unprocessed or unclaimed.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates more than 500,00 seasoned nurses will retire by the end of 2022. Additionally, the National Center for Biotechnology Information found that while nursing employment opportunities are expected to grow 15 percent by 2026, the aging population of baby boomers, burnout from those currently in health care, and the stress from the COVID-19 pandemic means hospitals are even more understaffed, leading to increased patient mortality.

However, with more than double the available green cards this year, recruiters hope to bring more nurses to hospitals to help mitigate the staffing shortage.

Amy L. Erlbacher-Anderson, an immigration attorney, told the Associated Press she is seeing a greater demand for foreign nurses now than she has in 18 years.

""We have double the number of visas we've had available for decades,"" she said. ""That is kind of temporarily creating a very open situation.""

In September, the U.S. State Department instructed embassies to prioritize visa applications for health care workers on a case-by-case basis. However, Greg Siskind, an immigration attorney, told the AP U.S. consulate offices are not required to issue visas simply because they are available and most green cards are awarded to professionals already in the U.S.

Faith Akinmade, a nurse from Nigeria, has been working as an ICU nurse in Kentucky, but her work visa is set to expire in March, meaning one more nurse could be leaving her understaffed hospital.

""At this point and time, I just feel like I have faith that at the end of March, something is going to show up to continue to work,"" Akinmade told the AP.

Additionally, while the American Association of Colleges of Nursing reported a six percent increase in enrollment, insufficient faculty to teach and COVID constraints limited the number of students accepted to study in the program.

Sinead Carbery, the president of a nursing recruiting firm, told the New York Times nearly 1,000 nurses are arriving in the U.S. each month, the highest she's seen in three decades. Additionally, since the start of the pandemic, she said the demand for international nurses rose somewhere between 300 percent and 400 percent.

However, hospitals seeing nursing shortages before the pandemic will still face them despite the potential increase of foreign nurses coming to the U.S.

Avant Healthcare Professionals, which recruits nurses from countries overseas to place them in the U.S. hospitals, used to see 800 nurse requests, but now have more than 4,000.

""And that's just us, a single organization,"" Lesley Hamilton-Powers, the president of Avant told KTVQ-TV. ""Hospitals all over the country are stretched and looking for alternatives to fill nursing vacancies.""

Billings Clinic, the largest hospital in Montana, is just one of the many U.S. hospitals experiencing a shortage and turning to alternative methods to fill in the gap. In addition to hiring as many as 200 traveling nurses and paying them up to $200 an hour, the hospital also hired nearly two dozen nurses from countries, including the Philippines, Thailand, Kenya, Ghana, and Nigeria.

0,Denmark Has Lifted All COVID Restrictions���Why Isn't America Ready to Follow?,"Denmark became the first country in the European Union to lift all of its COVID restrictions on Tuesday. The country used its high vaccination rate to justify the move despite COVID cases in the country reaching their highest level in the pandemic.

People in Denmark are no longer required to wear face masks in indoor spaces. COVID passes for bars and restaurants and the need to self-isolate after a positive test result have also been removed.

The decision has been made as officials in countries, including the U.S., reconsider their approach to controlling COVID in what is the third calendar year of the pandemic. It also comes in the light of data suggesting the Omicron variant is less severe than its predecessors, and as vaccines and treatments have become more widely available.

Ahead in COVID deaths, the U.S. is behind Denmark in terms of COVID vaccinations, with just 64 percent of the country's population currently fully vaccinated. In Denmark, 81 percent of the population is fully vaccinated.

Mark Jit, professor of vaccine epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) in the U.K., told Newsweek: ""Right now countries with high vaccine coverage are able to relax restrictions without causing the same death rates we saw in previous waves. In the USA, due to lower vaccine coverage, death rates are higher and are continuing to rise.""

Jit cautioned against the lifting of restrictions in general. He told Newsweek: ""We still need to be vigilant as vaccine protection may wane and new variants may emerge. A new BA.2 Omicron variant that is more transmissible is spreading rapidly across Europe, and could cause cases to spike again, with a rise in deaths likely to follow.""

The epidemiologist said that allowing infections to spread so that people will develop natural immunity may not protect them from future variants, pointing out that being infected with Delta did not protect people from Omicron.

Jit concluded: ""For many countries with high vaccine coverage, we are entering a new phase of the COVID pandemic. But what this phase will look like is still unclear.""

COVID restrictions in the U.S.
Rules on restrictions such as masks and vaccine passports vary across the U.S. Currently, many U.S. states still require individuals to wear masks while indoors, with some areas such as Miami-Dade County, Florida, requiring visitors to county facilities to wear masks regardless of vaccination status, and others such as Portland, Maine saying masks need not be worn with proof of vaccination.

As of January 3, Chicago required residents over the age of 5 to show proof they are fully vaccinated to enter restaurants, fitness centers, and entertainment venues where food or drinks are served if their stay will last longer than 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in Indiana, Governor Eric Holcomb has signed a bill that bans state or local governments from requiring vaccine passports.

Seema Lakdawala, a respiratory virus expert at the University of Pittsburgh, told The New York Times she was surprised more states did not have new mask mandates amid the rise of the more transmissible Omicron variant. She said: ""I'm not sure anywhere at the moment is in a place that there is sufficient decrease in cases, at least in the U.S., to warrant taking off mask mandates.""

Lakdawala said that while she was ""hopeful we've turned a corner,"" she wants to see weeks of a downward trend for the virus.",TRUE,https://www.newsweek.com/denmark-vaccination-rate-covid-restrictions-lifted-compared-us-1674953,Science,Newsweek
0,Chicago Schools' COVID Testing Taking Double the Promised Turnaround Time,"icole Granacki has spent weeks dedicating her time to encourage parents at her daughter's school to sign up for the COVID testing program provided by the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) district.

When her hard work finally appeared to pay off���with testing enrollment among pre-K students jumping from 35 percent to 70 percent in a month���the district's program failed to take advantage of her efforts, with stagnant testing rates and delayed results.

For many parents and families at Helen C. Peirce Elementary, the testing program offered by CPS has been critical to their children's COVID safety.

Parents like Granacki rely on weekly testing to ensure that her four-year-old, who is too young to be eligible for COVID vaccination, is healthy.

NEWSWEEK NEWSLETTER SIGN-UP >
But the delay in testing results has rendered CPS' program almost pointless now that quarantine guidelines have shifted again.

While CPS has promised to deliver digital access to test results within 24 to 72 hours, parents at Peirce Elementary have been waiting four to five days���and some up to seven days���for their results.

By the time they've received their child's results, the recommended five-day isolation period for unvaccinated kids���a CPS policy that went into effect this week���has already passed.

""This essentially means no quarantining for unvaccinated students like my pre-K child,"" Granacki told Newsweek. ""I've been at our school advocating everybody to sign up for the testing program and we have a lot of families enrolled in that program, more than at other schools.""

NEWSWEEK SUBSCRIPTION OFFERS >
""Now the families are asking me, 'Well, what's the point of even doing this?' because the results are so slow that we can't take action on it,"" she said.

Comparably, students in nearby District 65, which includes Evanston and Skokie, have reportedly received next-day or same-day results as part of their testing program, which is being run by SHIELD Illinois and the University of Illinois.

School administrators in Chicago have noted that the result delays may be because Thermo Fisher samples are mailed and processed in Atlanta, unlike the SHIELD program, which is being used by more than 1,700 school districts and universities in the state.

Not only are testing results being delayed at Chicago schools, but Thermo Fisher Scientific���the company conducting the tests in partnership with CPS���has also reportedly failed to send enough testers to adequately test all the students enrolled in the program.

During the last week of January, Thermo Fisher only tested 38 percent of the Peirce Elementary students who signed up for weekly testing.

""One thing that had changed after the [Chicago Teachers Union] work stoppage was that [the district] encouraged more people to enroll, but there's not actually more testing being done at our school because there are not enough [testers],"" Granacki said.

CPS has said that while they are aspiring to be able to test all the students enrolled in the program, it is not currently committed to doing so.

""It's really discouraging to see this amazing joint effort between our families and our school administration���we're all working together to get everybody signed up for testing to keep our kids safe���and then we didn't actually see an increase in the number of tests that were being given in their school,"" Granacki said. ""Families have been disappointed each week when their kids are untested.""

The district's failure to provide enough testing resources to schools has forced some parents, like Granacki, to make difficult decisions.

For most of January, when the Omicron wave was sweeping through much of the country, she decided to keep her daughter at home even though the four-year-old wanted to be in person because Granacki didn't feel safe sending her child to school while positivity rates were still high.

""Families have been disappointed each week when their kids are untested,"" Chicago Public Schools parent Nicole Granacki told Newsweek. Students walk to A. N. Pritzker elementary school on January 12 in Chicago, Illinois.

Granacki hopes that by using COVID relief funds, CPS will be able to provide quicker test results and more resources to ensure that everyone enrolled in the weekly testing program can get a test.

In an ideal world, she said she wishes the district would adopt an opt-out program���an idea Mayor Lori Lightfoot has adamantly opposed.

Lightfoot has called it morally wrong for schools to be performing a ""quasi-medical procedure"" without parental consent.

""As a parent of a child, I would be outraged if a school system was doing anything with my child that I didn't know about, and I didn't affirmatively authorize,"" the mayor said earlier this month. ""Why would we take that option away from parents? We're not going to do that. Come up with a different plan.""

But Granacki said that most of the parents she's spoken to are not against expanded testing. She said the real reason many families haven't opted-in yet is that the district has made it difficult for parents to access enrollment forms.",TRUE,https://www.newsweek.com/chicago-schools-covid-testing-taking-double-promised-turnaround-time-1675867,Science,Newsweek
0,Ecologists Discover 400 Species Of Charles Darwin Living In Gal��pagos Islands,"PUERTO BAQUERIZO MORENO, ECUADOR���Describing an astounding variety of naturalists previously unknown to science, a team of ecologists from Stanford University announced Friday the discovery of more than 400 species of Charles Darwin living in the Gal��pagos Islands.

The Darwins, which researchers said have evolved to fill a staggering array of ecological niches throughout the archipelago, appear to have developed dramatically varied biological structures through the process of speciation, exhibiting beard lengths, for example, that range from closely cropped in some species to past the knee in others. Members of the Stanford team said they could tell which island a Darwin was from simply by studying the shape and thickness of its mutton chops.

���Our analysis of the fossil record suggests all the Darwins likely descended from a single ancestor that arrived from the mainland approximately two centuries ago.���
���The breathtaking diversity of Charles Darwin we see in the Gal��pagos is the result of each species having adapted to survive in different environments,��� said head researcher Dr. Robert Colletti, citing the example of a cold-blooded, 6-inch-long scaly Darwin that can fit into small holes on the sides of volcanic cliffs. ���We see Darwins of every conceivable sort, like an avian Darwin with a sophisticated vocal mechanism that allows it to mimic observations about natural history, or a bright pink, feathered Darwin that stands on long legs in shallow water and gets its color from the massive quantity of brine shrimp it consumes.���

���Our analysis of the fossil record suggests all the Darwins likely descended from a single ancestor that arrived from the mainland approximately two centuries ago,��� Colletti added. ���It���s absolutely remarkable.���

The ecologists explained that the proliferation of Charles Darwin in the Gal��pagos began with a now-extinct mammalian species, which at one time roamed the islands foraging for specimens of flora and fauna it could collect, place into categories according to their physical characteristics, and then carefully label before sending off to Cambridge University for expert analysis by contemporary naturalists.

As time passed, many highly adaptive traits appear to have emerged in its descendants, such as the thin, nimble talons that allowed one species of Darwin to examine the physiology of earthworms and determine its effects upon the soil before going on to write a popular book on the subject. Another remarkable adaptation can reportedly be observed in the still-extant citron-crowned Darwin, which displays its brilliantly colored bald spot during its courtship dance to woo sexual partners with its presumed virility.

According to Colletti and his team, most Charles Darwins are now vanishingly rare, as are many of the species that depend upon them, including a critically endangered orchid that can only be pollinated by one uniquely adapted Darwin with a 12-inch-long proboscis.

���We must act quickly if we wish to save the Darwins,��� said Colletti, expressing concern about the potential overfishing of aquatic Darwins, which he worried would be traded as exotic pets or sold as meat. ���Throughout the Gal��pagos, invasive species represent a real threat: Darwins are unable to compete for scarce water with large land mammals such as cattle and donkeys. And even the fittest Darwins, unfortunately, are unable fend off attacks from the feral pigs that now roam the islands.���

Though scientists cannot be certain what caused the sudden explosion of divergent Darwin species 200 years ago, they have noted that newly unearthed journals of the British naturalist Charles Darwin describe in detail the many nights he spent alone in the Gal��pagos longing for the intimate embrace of another.",FALSE,https://www.theonion.com/ecologists-discover-400-species-of-charles-darwin-livin-1830382825,Science,Onion
0,Facebook Announces Plan To Combat Fake News Stories By Making Them Actually Happen,"MENLO PARK, CA���Responding to widespread criticism over the hoaxes and political disinformation featured on its platform, Facebook announced at a press conference Friday a new initiative to combat fake news by making the inaccurate stories on the social media site actually happen.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who told reporters it was vitally important that Facebook address the false information it distributes and regain the trust of users by bringing every single untrue story to life, said the company has already hired 100,000 new employees to carry out widespread government conspiracies and other erroneously reported activities until all purported news on the site was accurate.

���We take this problem very seriously, and I want our users to be confident that the stories they see on Facebook are either true already or will be very soon,��� said Zuckerberg, who explained that the company has budgeted $45 billion toward ensuring that anytime news on the site was determined to be fake, vast resources would be available to make that news real. ���For example, if you read about high-level Democrats running a child sex ring out of the basement of a D.C.-area pizzeria, we will go to that restaurant, dig a basement if there isn���t one already, and get that human-trafficking operation up and running. That���s how dedicated we are to factual accuracy at Facebook.���

���In fact, we recently stopped a major fake story when we forced thousands of Muslim families to establish sharia law in Dallas and then blackmailed the entire police department until they agreed to treat a local neighborhood as a no-go zone,��� Zuckerberg added.

In addition to employing a new, state-of-the-art algorithm to help sort out stories that are currently true from those that need to become true, officials said the company would introduce a new feature that allows users to flag articles that are not yet real. According to sources, stories would then be sent to Facebook���s fact-checking partners, including InfoWars, YourNewsWire.com, and the Daily Stormer, for further review.

The social media company has also completed construction on a 3-million-square-foot command center in Silicon Valley, from which it will deploy tens of thousands of employees to points across the globe in order to carry out in real life the events depicted in fake stories, whether that means setting up Obamacare death panels, hiring immigrants to go out and commit crimes in disproportionately high numbers, convincing Melania Trump to employ a body double, or working around the clock to develop a vaccine that will finally cause autism in children.

���If an article on Facebook states that President Trump���s agenda is being undermined due to a deep-state conspiracy headed by Ellen DeGeneres, it is our public responsibility to infiltrate the federal government with thousands of highly trained agents, recruit Ms. DeGeneres as an asset, and make that a reality,��� said Zuckerberg, who also outlined a plan to purchase a massive fleet of jets that will spray trails of chemicals across the sky in order to psychologically manipulate the world���s populace. ���As a precautionary measure, we���ve already begun sending paychecks to anyone who protests at an event where Trump is speaking, just in case another story on Facebook accuses them of having been paid for their efforts.���

���Similarly, in response to fabricated accounts on Facebook of how the government is attempting to destroy Second Amendment rights, we staged a ���school shooting��� in which no one actually died and child actors were used to portray the supposedly dead victims,��� Zuckerberg continued.

Executives at Facebook confirmed their efforts go beyond fighting politically motivated stories, saying that after an article about a sleeping morgue employee being mistaken for a dead body and cremated was flagged as false, they saw to it the individual in question was burned alive. In response to a story spread on the site about a banana in an Oklahoma Walmart testing positive for HIV, Facebook hired a team of scientists to genetically engineer fruit capable of contracting the disease and had it placed in the store���s produce department.

Because fake celebrity death stories are among the most widespread of hoaxes perpetuated on Facebook, the company has reportedly corrected those mistakes by ordering its in-house team of assassins to kill Kirk Douglas, Bob Barker, Robert Redford, Carlos Santana, Paul McCartney, Jackie Chan, Mark McGrath, and others.

Early feedback from Facebook users on the plan to make fake news real has been largely positive.

���It���s great to know that when I see a story about Malia Obama getting arrested for drug possession, Facebook will, one way or another, make sure that is indeed what happens,��� said 33-year-old Greenville, NC resident Keith Wade. ���I hate it when I get told things like, ���Delta Airlines is offering free tickets if you take a short survey,��� and then find out later it���s not true.

0,NASA���s Mars Roomba Begins Mission To Clean Dust From Planet���s Surface,"PASADENA, CA���As part of ongoing preparations for a manned mission to the Red Planet, scientists at NASA���s Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced Wednesday that its autonomous Mars Roomba vehicle had landed safely and commenced the task of cleaning dust from the planet���s surface.

A NASA spokesperson confirmed that the circular, 1,900-pound, self-navigating vacuum had survived the 8-month journey from Earth with all vital sweeping and suction systems intact and had already begun removing iron oxide particles and small debris from the approximately 55.9 million square miles of Martian terrain.

���At this rate, we project that the entire planet will be spick and span by the time the first astronauts arrive.���

���We���re pleased to say that after years of planning, the Mars Roomba is finally hard at work cleaning some of the dustiest parts of the Red Planet,��� said senior engineer James Wurzburg, describing the jubilant scene at mission control after the Roomba successfully touched down and immediately started vacuuming loose pebbles and dust kicked up by its retrorockets during descent. ���Everything from the bristle brushes to the satellite mapping software is currently functioning as designed. In fact, the Roomba has already made significant progress in tidying up the Schiaparelli Crater.���

���At this rate, we project that the entire planet will be spick and span by the time the first astronauts arrive,��� added Wurzburg.

According to NASA officials, the Mars Roomba uses a number of advanced features to navigate and clean up around its environment, including independently spinning tracks of all-terrain wheels that allow it to turn a full 360 degrees while traveling at a maximum speed of 1.3 kilometers per hour, and an array of proximity sensors that can discern steep slopes and prevent it from accidentally plunging into a canyon. Additionally, NASA personnel confirmed the autonomous cleaning vehicle includes a contact-detecting front bumper that signals it to change directions whenever it encounters a large boulder or other obstacle.

For power, mission engineers confirmed that the Mars Roomba employs a portable nuclear reactor that provides up to three sols worth of cleaning time before the vehicle is forced to return to its self-charging station.

Prior to the Roomba���s launch, researchers reportedly spent six years testing various prototypes in a particularly dusty and desolate stretch of the Nevada desert, ultimately settling on a lightweight design that could remove all dirt down to the bedrock.

���If we���re ever going to establish a long-term colony, it���s crucial that the planet is tidy,��� said project director Kaitlyn Mendoza, highlighting the potential danger of future astronauts tracking muck all over the place. ���The first Mars cleaning rover we sent in 1997, Sterility, had a pair of radio-controlled mop and bucket arms, but those just resulted in getting the Cydonia region all muddy. It���s a unique set of challenges compared to, say, the moon, where we could just have Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin clean the whole lunar surface with push brooms.���

���But fortunately everything is going to plan with the Roomba, minus a brief period where it kept bumping into the Olympus Mons over and over,��� Mendoza continued.

0,Nvidia gives upbeat revenue forecast; Applied Materials sees supply-chain challenges,"Feb 16 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) on Wednesday forecast current-quarter revenue above analysts' estimates, banking on the strong demand for data centers.

Nvidia expects first-quarter revenue of about $8.1 billion, compared with analysts' estimates of $7.29 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

���We are seeing exceptional demand for NVIDIA computing platforms,��� Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in a statement. Data center revenue grew 71% to $3.26 billion in the fourth quarter.

Despite the strong results, Nvidia shares were down 2.5% in after-hours trading, and KinNgai Chan, analyst at Summit Insights Group, said the company's sales to the crypto industry could be a concern.

""A meaningful part of its gaming sales do include crypto-mining which we think could be volatile. Our most recent industry check does indicate a significant weakness in crypto-mining demand,"" said Chan.

Chan also said he was disappointed that Nvidia's gross margin did not rise in the fourth quarter from the third, despite the datacenter business outgrowing other units.

The company said it sold $550 million in crypto-specific cards in fiscal 2022, and only $24 million in the fourth quarter. Fourth-quarter gaming revenue was a record $3.42 billion, up 37% from a year ago.

With tech firms venturing into the ""metaverse"" and a spike in demand for data centers, revenue is surging for Nvidia, the world's largest maker of graphic and artificial intelligence chips, and for other chip makers.

Nvidia reported fourth-quarter revenue of $7.64 billion, a record, compared with estimates of $7.42 billion.

Nvidia's net income rose to about $3 billion in the fourth quarter from $2.46 billion a year earlier.

The results come on the heels of SoftBank Group Corp's (9984.T) collapsed deal to sell chip designer Arm to Nvidia. Worth up to $50 billion at current market prices, it would have been the largest-ever chip deal.

Meanwhile, supplier to chip makers Applied Materials Inc (AMAT.O) also posted record quarterly revenue on Wednesday, driven by robust demand for its semiconductor-making equipment from customers including Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company . read more

However, Applied Materials' chief executive, Gary Dickerson, said the supply environment remains challenging and that the company is doing everything it can to deliver for customers. The company expected second-quarter revenue of $6.35 billion, marginally below analysts' estimates, according to Refinitiv data.

""Since we are already close to being sold out for the year, we also have a positive growth outlook for 2023,"" Dickerson told analysts on a conference call, adding that demand is very strong and spending on wafer fabrication equipment could reach $100 billion in 2022.

The space rock, called 2022 BH7, will pass our planet on Friday whilst traveling at a speed of more than 50,000 miles per hour.

It will reach its closest distance to Earth at around 4:45 p.m. ET that day, when it will be around 1.4 million miles away���roughly six times as far away as the moon is.

As such, Earth will be perfectly safe during 2022 BH7's pass. However, the asteroid is still classed as a potentially hazardous asteroid (PHA) by NASA's Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS).

Asteroids are given this classification based on their size and their potential to make threatening close passes by our planet, though an asteroid can still be a PHA even if it's not expected to hit Earth.

2022 BH7 meets this criteria, with its size estimated to be between 557 feet and 1,246 feet across, CNEOS data shows. This means that, at the upper limit, the asteroid could be nearly as wide as the Empire State Building is tall.

Again, Earth is expected to be perfectly safe when 2022 BH7 flies past. In fact, it's common for many asteroids to come much, much closer. CNEOS data shows that the asteroid 2022 CO6 is due to fly past Earth on Tuesday and will come within just over half the distance between Earth and the moon.

NEWSWEEK SUBSCRIPTION OFFERS >
2022 CO6 is still not expected to hit us, and in any case it is much smaller than 2022 BH7 with an estimated maximum diameter of around 144 feet.

While asteroid impacts may sound like the domain of Hollywood films, scientists take the threat they pose seriously. According to CNEOS, rocky or iron asteroids larger than about 100 meters (328 feet) across would be expected to reach Earth's surface once every 10,000 years or so on average. These would be large enough to cause local disasters, including tidal waves.

Once every several hundred thousand years or so, asteroids larger than a kilometer (0.62 miles) across would be expected to collide with our planet, which would pose a threat to life on Earth.

A couple of notable asteroid impacts have occurred in recent history���both of them in Russia. One was the 1908 Tunguska event, thought to have been caused by a space rock with varying size estimates up to 300 feet in diameter.

It hit near the Podkamennaya Tunguska River in central Siberia, producing an explosive force of as much as 15 megatons of TNT, which is 1,000 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, on August 6, 1945, according to Britannica. A NASA estimate puts the explosive force lower, equivalent to 185 times that of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.

Then there was the Chelyabinsk asteroid which exploded around 14 miles above the Russian city of Chelyabinsk in 2013.

Among the attackers��� targets was the hosting provider for Ukraine���s army and Privatbank, said Doug Madory, director of internet analysis at the network management firm Kentik Inc.

���There is no threat to depositors��� funds,��� Zhora���s agency, the Ukrainian Information Ministry���s Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security, said in a statement. Nor did the attack affect the communications of Ukraine���s military forces, said Zhora.

It was too early to say who was behind the attack, he added.

The ministry statement suggested Russian involvement: ���It is possible that the aggressor resorted to tactics of petty mischief, because his aggressive plans aren���t working overall,��� the Ukrainian statement said.

Quick attribution in cyberattacks is typically difficult, as aggressors often try to hide their tracks.

���We need to analyze logs from IT providers,��� Zhora said

Oleh Derevianko, a leading private-sector expert and founder of the ISSP cybersecurity firm, said Ukrainians are always worried that such ���noisy��� cyberattacks could be masking something more sinister.

Escalating fears about a Russian invasion of Ukraine eased slightly as Russia sent signals Tuesday that it might be pulling back from the brink, but Western powers demanded proof.

The cyber aggression is nevertheless typical of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who likes to try to keep his adversaries off balance.

���These attacks are ratcheting up attention and pressure,��� said Christian Sorensen, the CEO of the cybersecurity firm SightGain who previously worked for U.S. Cyber Command. ���The purpose at this stage is to increase leverage in negotiations.���

Ukraine has been subject to a steady diet of Russian aggression in cyberspace since 2014, when Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula and backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.

On Jan. 14, a cyberattack that damaged servers at Ukraine���s State Emergency Service and at the Motor Transport Insurance Bureau with a malicious ���wiper��� cloaked as ransomware. The damage proved minimal ��� some cybersecurity experts think that was by design, given the capabilities of Russian state-backed hackers. A message posted simultaneously on dozens of defaced Ukrainian government websites said: ���Be afraid and expect the worst.���

Serhii Demediuk, the No. 2 official at Ukraine���s National Security and Defense Council, called the Jan. 14 attack ���part of a full-scale Russian operation directed at destabilizing the situation in Ukraine, aimed at exploding our Euro-Atlantic integration and seizing power.���

Such attacks are apt to continue as Putin tries to ���degrade��� and ���delegitimize��� trust in Ukrainian institutions, the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said in a subsequent blog post.

In the winters of 2015 and 2016, attacks on Ukraine���s power grid attributed to Russia���s GRU military intelligence agency temporarily knocked out power.

Russia���s GRU has also been blamed for perhaps the most devastating cyberattack ever.

0,EXPLAINER: Will burglar alarms still work after 3G shutdown?,"NEW YORK (AP) ��� As telecom companies rev up the newest generation of mobile service, called 5G, they���re shutting down old networks ��� a costly, years-in-the-works process that���s now prompting calls for a delay because many products out there still rely on the old standard, 3G.

AT&T is scheduled to be the first carrier to shut down its 3G network on Feb. 22. T-Mobile will shut down its 3G network by summer and Verizon in December.

The home-alarm industry has asked the Federal Communications Commission, the U.S. regulator, to delay AT&T���s network sunset until December. The FCC is monitoring the 3G phase-out and working to ���implement safeguards��� for older phones and other devices, spokesperson Paloma Perez said late Monday.

Verizon has already pushed back its shutdown ��� twice ��� from an original target date in 2019, saying customers needed more time to update their devices. T-Mobile has also delayed the shutdown of the Sprint 3G network it acquired in 2020, to the end of March; it���ll shut down the T-Mobile 3G network by July 1.

EXPLAINER: Will burglar alarms still work after 3G shutdown?
WHY IS 3G SHUTTING DOWN?

First, some history. AT&T���s 3G network launched in the U.S. in 2004; later that decade it was the exclusive carrier for early iPhones, helping usher in the first phase of the smartphone era. The networks we currently rely on for video streaming, social apps, Uber and other must-haves of the modern era mostly use the subsequent 4G standard.

For the carriers, shutting down 3G is an efficiency move. As they upgrade to the latest technology, they shut off outdated networks and use the freed-up bandwidth for newer ��� and what they hope will be more profitable ��� services.

WHAT IF I HAVE AN OLDER PHONE?

People with older phones that aren���t compatible with 4G will have to upgrade; once 3G shuts down, those phones won���t work for calls or texting. AT&T says it has reached out to offer its customers free replacements via letters, emails and texts. Spokesperson Jim Greer said fewer than 1% of AT&T���s consumer devices, including phones, tablets and watches, will lose cellular service, but declined to say how many devices that is. The company reported about 196 million phones and connected devices using its network in the most recent quarter.

WHAT ABOUT OTHER DEVICES?

Industry groups have also raised concerns about other products that will need to be replaced or updated ��� everything from home fire alarms to ankle bracelets used by law enforcement. It���s not certain how many outdated products are out there, or how big a deal it would be if updates take place after Feb. 22.

The alarm industry and other companies say they have had issues replacing devices even though they���ve known about the coming shutdown for years. Recent setbacks include both pandemic-triggered supply-chain issues and customers hesitant to let technicians into their homes during the pandemic.

HOW MANY OUTDATED PRODUCTS ARE OUT THERE?

It���s not really clear. An alarm-industry lobbying group estimates that 1.5 million customers still need to upgrade their fire or burglar alarms, while about half a million have medical alert devices that run on 3G; it said most rely on AT&T service. While an unnetworked fire alarm will still sound an alarm if there���s smoke, it won���t be able to contact the fire department. Likewise, burglar alarms won���t route to emergency responders if triggered. Not all providers say there���s an issue. ADT said in November that it was on track to update its AT&T customers by February; a spokesperson declined to offer an update on Sunday.

AARP, the advocacy group for adults over 50, is also concerned that users of medical alert systems ��� those necklaces and bracelets, like Life Alert ��� that connect users to emergency call centers won���t know their gadgets don���t work anymore or won���t be able to replace them in time.

HOW SHOULD I PREPARE?

Check your phone to make sure it will still work. Here���s an AT&T list of devices that the carrier says will work normally after Feb. 22. Call the companies that make or service your burglar and fire alarms and personal medical alert systems to see if any need an update. If so, schedule a service visit immediately or get a new device shipped.

OK, DONE. ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD WORRY ABOUT?

A few. One manufacturer of ankle bracelets for people on probation, parole or pre-trial release said it hasn���t been able to update many 3G-reliant devices. A premature shutdown could potentially allow tens of thousands of offenders like child abusers, sex offenders and drunk drivers to go unmonitored while out of prison, Alcohol Monitoring Systems wrote in an August FCC filing. The company did not respond to questions.

Zonar, which provides GPS and other services for buses and trucks, says tens of thousands of vehicles will be affected. Trucks that aren���t upgraded may have to be idled if drivers can���t electronically log their hours as federal rules require. Zonar has a workaround for the trucking industry, but not all customers have placed orders for it, said Susan Corscadden, a company marketing executive.

Affected school districts could also lose their ability to track the location of school buses, while their drivers may not be able to use GPS systems for directions. The National Association for Pupil Transportation seconded these concerns in a September filing, although Noelle Ellerson Ng, the group���s legislative liaison, said in an interview that she hasn���t heard school superintendents raise the issue.

SO DOES THE SHUTDOWN POSE A SERIOUS PUBLIC-SAFETY THREAT?

It���s unclear. ���There���s a lot of uncertainty about the impact and about how many people are affected,��� said Tom Kamber, the executive director of Older Adults Technology Services, a nonprofit affiliated with AARP. The AARP has asked the FCC to delay the AT&T shutdown until December.

Public Knowledge, a public-interest group, also urged the FCC to block the February shutdown unless AT&T can show that it has made sure that essential services won���t be disrupted or that it can restore service immediately if problems arise.

SO WHY NOT DELAY?

AT&T says that delaying the shutdown would hurt its 5G rollout, degrading its customers��� ability to use their service and causing more dropped calls. The company argues that the alarm companies have had years to upgrade their customers��� devices. The company also says the FCC doesn���t have the authority to stop its shutdown.",TRUE,https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-federal-communications-commission-967e798ec0bb8074f1815b06cf01a0c1,Science,AP
0,GM to restart Chevy Bolt factory after battery fire recalls,"DETROIT (AP) ��� General Motors says it will start making Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles again in early April after an eight-month pause due to a series of battery fire recalls.

The automaker says Tuesday that battery supplier LG Energy Solution is now making enough to supply replacement modules for the recalls as well as to resume production.

The company will start making hatchback and SUV versions of the Bolt on April 4 at a factory north of Detroit. Those should start reaching dealers a few weeks later. Vehicles on dealer lots at the time of the recalls can be sold once battery modules are replaced.

In August GM expanded a previous recall to more than 140,000 Bolts sold worldwide since 2016 because battery manufacturing defects could cause the vehicles to catch fire.

The company said at the time that in rare cases, batteries that have two manufacturing defects can cause fires even when parked.

The recall follows reports of 13 battery fires, GM said, which can occur when both defects are present in the battery modules.

In October LG agreed to reimburse GM $2 billion for the recall costs, and the company remains in a joint venture with the company to build batteries for its next generation of electric vehicles.

The battery fires and recalls have been an embarrassing setback for GM, which has lofty goals of switching from internal combustion to battery powered vehicles. GM sold just under 25,000 Bolts in the U.S. before telling dealers to stop selling them due to the recall in August.

To capture U.S. electric vehicle market share leadership, GM plans to spend $35 billion to roll out more than 30 new battery vehicles globally by 2025, including about 20 in North America. The company has said it aspires to make only electric passenger vehicles by 2035.

GM has said it plans to overtake Tesla as the world���s leading seller of electric vehicles. Tesla sold just under 353,000 EVs in the U.S. last year, according to estimates from Motorintelligence.com.

GM has started selling its Hummer large electric vehicles and plans to start making a Cadillac SUV next month. A Chevy Silverado electric pickup is to follow in 2024.

0,"World Economic Forum Wargames How To Push Digital ID, Vaccine Passports","A new document by the World Economic Forum (WEF) outlines how to introduce the world population to a digital ID system based on technology that will someday be ���embedded in the skin.���

The 46-page document called ���Advancing Digital Agency: The Power of Data Intermediaries��� claims that because a digital ID will be used for authentication in virtually every aspect of your life ��� from financial services to travel and commerce ��� the technology could ���enhance privacy protection��� and ���reduce rise of identity fraud.���


But if you dig deeper, the document goes on to explain how a digital ID won���t be used just for authentication, but also to record biometric attributes, credit and medical histories, online and purchasing behaviors, and even to control the ability to travel.


The WEF cites the widely unpopular vaccine passport as a ���form of digital ID��� the globalist body calls an ���incredible public health asset��� that ���verifies��� your private health information.

Such vaccine passports are used when travelling between jurisdictions and at a local level, such as when entering dining establishments or other places where proof of vaccination status is necessary. Importantly, these intermediaries provide a means of verifying status without sharing health data with the establishment per se, in a sort of zero-knowledge proof scenario whereby the trusted data intermediary verifies that the data subject is vaccinated but does not share any other information. This avoids unwanted secondary effects of the establishment sharing the data any further.

As we���ve reported, the digital ID is a key component of the WEF���s Great Reset agenda, which aims to transform the world���s economy and institutions into a global communist New World Order, where private property and free market enterprise no longer exist.

Another aspect of the digital ID and Great Reset, according to WEF founder and transhumanist Klaus Schwab, is to merge the physical, digital, and biological worlds to fundamentally change ���what it means to be human.���

0,Top Chinese Whistleblower Warns CCP May Deploy Hemorrhagic Fever Virus At Winter Olympics,"The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) could use the Winter Olympics as an outbreak vector for a new and more deadly virus developed by its military bioweapons program, according to virologist Dr. Li-Meng Yan.

���The CCP is enlarging their whole military-civilian fusion network���to develop their bioweapon industry,��� Dr. Yan said in a Saturday interview on the JD Rucker Show.

Dr. Yan explained that the CCP was developing more ���gain of function viruses��� mixed with powerful misinformation operations to sow more chaos when another outbreak occurs.

And a good testing ground for this next phase of their bioweapons program is the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, Dr. Yan claims.

���Intelligence also shows China would launch such bio-attacks during the Winter Olympics,��� Dr. Yan said.

���So the first thing is, the Winter Olympics is a great opportunity for the Chinese Communist Party,��� she continued. ���People [gather] somewhere, and then within a short while spread the bioweapon all over the world and it���s difficult for you to trace the origin.���

���Multiple sources also told me that the CCP are trying more bioweapons, especially the virus that causes hemorrhagic fever,��� she said, such as Ebola, Lassa, Marburg, or the hantavirus, which can cause 50% mortality ���without good treatment.���

Dr. Yan then described how the CCP recently locked down the northwest Shaanxi province after cases of hemorrhagic fever were recently reported, which the CCP claimed was simply an isolated outbreak of COVID-19.

���Our sources showed that this lockdown in Xian is a military drill. So there is not only one type of hemorrhagic fever virus released,��� Dr. Yan said, adding that the military separated the patients who were experiencing different symptoms from one another, such as Marburg symptoms.

���Such patients were sent to the military hospital, and other people didn���t even notice,��� she said.

Several cases of hemorrhagic fever were even reported in the UK just days ago, marking the first time the illness was found in the country in over a decade.

Dr. Yan claimed the CCP has discovered an antidote to these new deadlier hemorrhagic fever viruses: a Johnson & Johnson drug called Darzalex (daratumumab), an expensive drug currently used to treat multiple myeloma.

���This is not a common drug like hydroxychloroquine,��� she said, explaining that China plans to ���kidnap��� these antidotes all over the world once the ���panic��� from their hemorrhagic fever virus outbreak ensues.

Symptoms of hemorrhagic fever, depending on the virus, range from high fever and bleeding from the eyes and mouth, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting, shock, and even death in many cases.

Given Dr. Yan���s credentials and high credibility after blowing the whistle on the origins of COVID-19 and the CCP���s military bioweapons program in 2020, this information is particularly alarming and hopefully some U.S. lawmakers will take her warnings seriously.",FALSE,https://www.infowars.com/posts/top-chinese-whistleblower-warns-ccp-deploying-hemorrhagic-fever-virus-at-winter-olympics/,Science,Infowars
0,AI ���Nanny��� Being Created By Chinese Scientists To Grow Babies In Robot Wombs,"The artificial intelligence nanny has arrived. Robots and artificial intelligence (AI) may now be used in conjunction to optimize the generation of human life, marking a significant milestone in the science.

Robotics and artificial intelligence can now assist in the development of newborns via the use of algorithms and artificial wombs, which is eerily similar to what we see in the cult classic, The Matrix.

According to the South China Morning Post, Chinese experts in Suzhou have pioneered the development of the latest technological breakthrough. However, there are concerns about the ethical implications of raising human beings in an artificial environment.

The discoveries were published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Biomedical Engineering by Suzhou-based scientists. The AI nanny, according to the researchers, might aid in the growth of human kids in a ���long-term embryo culture device.���

This artificial womb is a big machine containing compartments for individual fetuses. The infants will be fed as they would be in a real womb if they are in the chamber, which will be filled with an optimized mix of ���nutritious fluids.���


A shocking video reveals the tyranny of Communist China in 2022.

In what seems sort of eugenics-y, a record of embryo health and ���developmental potential��� will be kept on file by the software over the duration of the embryo���s development.

It probably won���t happen any time soon..
At the moment, the new technology is being utilized to assist in the development of animal embryos that are developing into fetuses in the laboratory. This is due to the fact that the act of experimenting on human embryos older than two weeks is prohibited under international law.

Additionally, as the SMCP points out, surrogacy is prohibited in China. Because artificial wombs would effectively convert a hospital or laboratory into a mother under Chinese legislation, the technology is unlikely to be deployed in the area anytime soon.

Having said that, the development of artificial wombs is not a new concept. While this is not a new discovery, bringing the technology into human mass production and mixing it with ranking AI is, and it is a development that is quite dystopian sounding.

Of course, not everything is a hopeless dystopia..
Although the thought of artificially developing human infants is a far-fetched one, there are certain advantages to it. In the past, for example, the process of producing kids within people has been a lengthy, drawn-out, and unpleasant process, and this could potentially aid mothers who would like to have children, but are currently unable to, without having to use a human surrogate. After all, the population is about to start shrinking by the billions by the end of the century and fertility rates around the globe are collapsing at a frightening rate. 

This seems like more of a ���when��� rather than an ���if���..
When artificial human growth becomes available, it will enable couples who would otherwise be at danger during delivery to have children. Adoption is also an option for thousands of children currently in foster care who may be placed in permanent families.

0,BioNTech plans modular vaccine factories in Africa,"BERLIN (AP) ��� German vaccine maker BioNTech, which developed the first widely approved shot against COVID-19 together with Pfizer, unveiled plans Wednesday to establish manufacturing facilities in Africa that would boost the availability of much-needed medicines on the continent.

The modular design presented at a ceremony in Marburg, Germany, consists of shipping containers fitted with the equipment necessary to make the company���s mRNA-based vaccine, save for the final step of putting doses into bottles, a process known as fill and finish.

���Our goal is to enable mRNA production on all continents,��� BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin told The Associated Press.

BioNTech has been criticized by some campaign groups for refusing to suspend its vaccine patents and let rivals manufacture the shots as part of an effort to make them more widely available, especially in poor countries. The company argues that the process of making mRNA vaccines is difficult and it prefers to work with local partners to ensure consistent quality of the shots worldwide.

���Even collaborating with world-class companies, it takes three to four months just to ensure that the fill and finish (know-how) is transferred,��� Sahin said. ���And we have, of course, a limited capacity to do the full technology transfer.���

The first turnkey facility will be shipped to either Senegal or Rwanda in the second half of this year, BioNTech said. It aims to start production of up to 50 million doses of vaccine a year within 12 months, pending approval from local regulators.

That���s a fraction of the 1.2 billion doses the company produced in Marburg last year. But the vaccines made in the target country would likely be for use there and other African Union states at a not-for-profit price, BioNTech said.

BioNTech said it would initially staff and operate the facilities but later transfer the know-how to local partners to enable independent operation.

The system, which consists of 12 containers, could be scaled up easily in the future and modified to manufacture drugs for other diseases, such as malaria, cancer or tuberculosis, when they become available, the company said.

Sahin said adjusting the vaccine-manufacturing process also would be possible with the modular system.

���We could end up with vaccines requiring a lower dose or another formulation,��� he said.

The head of the World Health Organization, Secretary-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, welcomed BioNTech���s plan to increase vaccine production on the continent, saying it would complement the global body���s own effort to foster use of mRNA technology in South Africa and elsewhere.

WHO took the unusual step last year of teaming up with local companies and scientists to essentially replicate the mRNA-based COVID-19 shot made by U.S. company Moderna.

Sahin said BioNTech had no problem with other approaches.

���The more solutions are available, the better is the situation,��� he told the AP.

���We would like to bring our innovation to people worldwide,��� Sahin added. ���If others have similar aims, that���s perfect.���

Despite efforts to provide millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccine to Africa through an international donor mechanism, only about 11% of the population on the continent has received the shot, compared to the global average of about 50%.

0,S. Korea to give out rapid tests as omicron shatters record,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) ��� South Korea will distribute free coronavirus rapid test kits at schools and senior care facilities starting next week as it weathers an unprecedented wave of infections driven by the fast-moving omicron variant.

Health officials on Wednesday reported its highest daily jump in coronavirus infections with 90,443 new cases, shattering the previous one-day record set on Tuesday by more than 33,000 cases. The figure represents more than a 20-fold increase from the levels seen in mid-January, when omicron emerged as the country���s dominant strain, and some experts say the country could see daily cases of around 200,000 in March.

While experts say omicron appears less likely to cause serious illness or death compared to the delta variant, which rattled the country in December and early January, hospitalizations have been creeping up amid the greater scale of outbreak.

Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum, Seoul���s No. 2 official behind President Moon Jae-in, said officials will start distributing free rapid test kits next week at kindergartens, elementary schools and senior care facilities, including nursing homes and neighborhood welfare centers, to strengthen protection for unvaccinated children and high-risk groups.

Education Minister Yoo Eun-hye said schools will be getting enough kits for students to use twice a week, but added that such tests won���t be mandatory.

���We ask for students to be tested at home with the rapid antigen test kits on the evenings of Sunday and Wednesday before coming to school,��� Yoo said during a briefing. ���When testing positive from those tests, please visit the local health office to get PCR (lab) tests.���

Health workers have diagnosed a daily average of 60,230 new coronavirus cases in the past seven days, which translates to 116.64 infections per 100,000 people, as the national caseload grew over 1.55 million.

The fast-developing omicron surge has left officials debating whether the country should maintain strict social distancing rules, including a six-person limit on private social gatherings and a 9 p.m. curfew for restaurants.

Struggling business owners have called for the measures to be removed, questioning whether they are meaningful when cases are growing rapidly.

But health experts warn that easing social distancing may allow transmissions to veer further out of control, which would further stretch worn-out health and government workers and threaten high-risk groups and children younger than 12 who have yet to be vaccinated.

The country has already eased quarantine restrictions significantly starting this month to prevent major disruptions at workplaces and essential services, which may occur if huge numbers of people are constantly forced into isolation.

There are also concerns that transmissions could worsen as campaigning and political rallies began on Tuesday ahead of the March 9 presidential elections.

Prime Minister Kim said officials will consider both the pandemic���s growing economic strain and threats posed by the omicron surge before announcing new social distancing measures on Friday.

While omicron more easily infects those who have been vaccinated or had COVID-19 previously, experts say vaccination and booster shots still provide strong protection from serious illness and death.

More than 86% of South Koreans have been fully vaccinated and 58% have received booster shots. Health officials plan to offer fourth vaccination shots at nursing homes and other long-term care settings starting later this month.

The country also started offering Novavax���s coronavirus vaccine at hospitals and public health offices this week, adding another tool in a mass immunization campaign that has mainly depended on Pfizer and Moderna���s mRNA vaccines.

China has been able to control the virus within its borders by maintaining a strict ���zero tolerance��� policy that involves total lockdowns, extensive contact tracing and mass testing millions of people. The strategy seeks to contain outbreaks as soon as they are detected.

Lam has stuck to the strategy despite geographical and other differences between Hong Kong and other parts of China. Last week, the entire upscale Discovery Bay neighborhood in Hong Kong was ordered to undergo testing after authorities found traces of the virus in its sewage.

The comments from Xi and Zheng were the latest pressure from Beijing for her to stay the course.

Thousands of people in the city have tested positive for COVID-19 and are waiting to be admitted into hospitals or isolation facilities, said Dr. Sara Ho, the chief manager for patient safety and risk management at the Hong Kong Hospital Authority.

���This situation is undesirable. Therefore, we are looking for ways with the government to set up more isolation facilities. We hope to shorten the patients��� waiting time,��� she added.

People who test positive are required to quarantine either in hospitals if they have serious symptoms or in government-run facilities for light or asymptomatic cases. The record number of new cases, driven by the highly transmissible omicron variant, has led to the current overcrowding.

Yancey Yau, a construction worker, said the city���s hospital workers are facing heavy stress.

���They are working so hard. But the government is not doing what they should do,��� Yau said. ���The hospital workers are just miserable. I hope more citizens will support them. I don���t have any hope for this government.���

By contrast, the city-state of Singapore, which is similarly sized to Hong Kong with a population of some 5.7 million compared to 7.5 million, undertook strict lockdown measures early in the pandemic but is now pursuing a ���living with COVID��� approach.

The number of new cases per capita in Singapore has skyrocketed with the arrival of omicron, with 1,911 new cases per million people reported on Monday, versus 66 per million in Hong Kong, according to Our World in Data.

But people testing positive who have no symptoms or only mild symptoms just need to self-quarantine at home, and even those who have more severe symptoms are told to see a physician for medical advice before going to the hospital.

Consequently, it is not suffering the stress on its health care system that Hong Kong is now experiencing.

Singapore also boasts one of the world���s highest vaccination rates, with 88% of its population fully vaccinated, compared to Hong Kong���s 64%.",TRUE,https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-beijing-xi-jinping-hong-kong-6700d6a93c19f47ebb0a0ec7b9e0e413,Science,AP

The nation���s leading health officials said Wednesday that the U.S. is moving closer to the point that COVID-19 is no longer a ���constant crisis��� as more cities, businesses and sports venues began lifting pandemic restrictions around the country.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said during a White House briefing that the government is contemplating a change to its mask guidance in the coming weeks. Noting recent declines in COVID-19 cases, hospital admissions and deaths, she acknowledged ���people are so eager��� for health officials to ease masking rules and other measures designed to stop the spread of the coronavirus.

���We all share the same goal ��� to get to a point where COVID-19 is no longer disrupting our daily lives, a time when it won���t be a constant crisis ��� rather something we can prevent, protect against, and treat,��� Walensky said.

With the omicron variant waning and Americans eager to move beyond the virus, government and business leaders have been out ahead of the CDC in ending virus measures in the last week, including ordering workers back to offices, eliminating mask mandates and no longer requiring proof of vaccine to get into restaurants, bars and sports and entertainment arenas.

UK to offer COVID vaccine to all children 5-11
BioNTech plans modular vaccine factories in Africa
The efforts have been gaining more steam each day.

Philadelphia officials on Wednesday said the city���s vaccine mandate for restaurants was immediately lifted, though indoor mask mandates remain in place for now. At Disney World, vaccinated guests will no longer have to wear masks at the Florida theme park starting Thursday. Professional sports teams including the Utah Jazz and Washington Wizards and Capitals have stopped requiring proof of vaccine for fans.

Health Commissioner Cheryl Bettigole said Philadelphia���s average daily case count had dropped to 189 cases per day in the city of more than 1.5 million people. Bettigole said the plunge in infections has been steeper in Philadelphia than elsewhere in the state or the country, making it easier to lift the vaccine mandate for restaurants and other businesses announced in mid-December and that just fully went into effect this month.

���Our goal has always been to the least restrictive as possible while ensuring safety,��� she said.

In Provincetown, Massachusetts, a seaside town that became a COVID hot spot with an early outbreak of the delta variant last summer, officials on Tuesday lifted a mask mandate and vaccine requirement for indoor spaces like restaurants and bars. Town Manager Alex Morse said the community of about 3,000 recorded zero active cases last week among Provincetown residents ��� something that hasn���t happened since the surge following last year���s July 4 celebrations.

���We are learning to live with, and mitigate, the impact of the virus on our community,��� Morse said.

COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations have fallen sharply in the U.S., with the seven-day rolling average for daily new cases dropping from about 453,000 two weeks ago to about 136,000 as of Tuesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Hospitalizations are at levels similar to September, when the U.S. was emerging from the delta variant surge. Almost 65% of Americans are fully vaccinated.

���As a result of all this progress and the tools we now have, we are moving to a time where COVID isn���t a crisis but is something we can protect against and treat,��� said Jeff Zients, the White House coronavirus response coordinator.

Walensky said the CDC ���will soon put guidance in place that is relevant and encourages prevention measures when they are most needed to protect public health and our hospitals.��� She suggested any changes will take into account measures of community transmission, as well as hospitalization rates or other gauges of whether infected people are becoming severely ill. They also would consider available bed space in hospitals.

Several states with indoor mask mandates announced last week they would be lifted in coming weeks, also citing promising numbers.

Two music festivals that draw thousands of people to the California desert town of Indio in April and May, Coachella and Stagecoach, also said this week there will be no vaccination, masking or testing mandates in accordance with local guidelines. Coachella also noted that could change along with COVID conditions.

In Philadelphia, Bettigole said the vaccine mandate helped spur ���a very large��� increase in pediatric vaccinations, pushing the city way ahead of the national average for first doses among kids ages 5 to 11. More than 53% of Philadelphia residents in that age group have received a first dose, compared to closer to 30% nationally, she said.

Not all businesses plan to immediately change course. Philadelphia Irish sports bar and restaurant O���Neals will keep asking to see customers��� vaccination cards for now, said managing partner Greg ���Spoonie��� Rand, even though the city is lifting its vaccine mandate.

���Guests are more compliant and employees are more happy for us to continue doing vaccine cards inside,��� he said. He thinks vaccinated people will be wary of coming in if the pub stops checking cards.

Walensky said the CDC wants to ���give people a break from things like mask-wearing��� when circumstances improve, though be able to mask up again if things worsen. She also said there will be instances where people should continue to wear masks even if prevention measures ease. Examples include when individuals have symptoms of COVID-19 or are within 10 days after being diagnosed with it.",TRUE,https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-health-pandemics-rochelle-walensky-b55c18049f901dff2a9d83aa9557bbd1,Science,AP
0,"King County ending vaccine requirements at bars, restaurants","SEATTLE (AP) ��� Washington���s most populous county will no longer require COVID vaccination checks to enter restaurants, bars, theaters and gyms beginning March 1.

King County officials made the announcement Wednesday. The Seattle Times reports from March 1, businesses will be free to impose their own vaccination requirements if they choose, but there will be no countywide requirement.

Since last fall, indoor eateries and cultural and recreational spaces have been required to verify their customers��� vaccination status or a negative COVID test, as a condition for entry.

The policy has also applied to outdoor events with more than 500 people, like concerts and sporting events.

���Our public health experts believe that now is the appropriate time to lift vaccine verification, based on high rates of vaccine coverage and the decrease in new cases and hospitalizations across the county,��� King County Executive Dow Constantine said Wednesday.

Constantine and Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell also announced that they will begin, gradually, calling back to the office the thousands of county and city employees who have been working remotely for nearly two years.

0,Gwyneth Paltrow���s Vagina-Scented Candle Is Reportedly Giving People Herpes in Their Nasal Passages,"Gwyneth Paltrow, who has been shilling garbage Goop products for years ��� items that have been proven multiple times to be a sham at best, and potentially life-threatening in their bad pseudoscience at worst. But her latest endeavor, Goop candles that smell like her former A-list vagina, have added a new treat for people dumb enough to buy it ��� the candles are giving people herpes in their nose.

Paltrow, perhaps best known for playing Robert Downey Jr.���s love interest, Pepper Potts, in the Iron Man films, has fallen to the levels of midnight pitchman over the last few years, and for some reason thought that selling candles scented specifically like her putrid pussy would be hot sellers. Somewhat confusingly, she appears to be right, as the candles are selling, but as they are made from the ���natural juices��� of Paltrow���s poon, they smell like her vagina, and are also causing people who burn the candle too long to contract herpes.

���I first noticed that I had a weird bump on the outside of my nose,��� said Kirk Brown, who has estimated he���s spent around $2,000 on several hundreds of Paltrow���s candles. ���I thought it was a pimple. It happens. After it got severe, and I started to feel the bumps in my nose, I went to the doctor. A test confirmed it was nose herpes. I didn���t even know it was possible!���

���I only burned one of her candles for a very short time,��� said Melissa Rogers of Atlanta. ���I got it as a gag gift from a co-worker at Christmastime. It smelled horrendous; like a cross between stale pee and the cheese you scrape out of an infected vagina. I was not a fan. I became less of a fan when it became clear that I was getting nose herpes.

1509,Baldwin taking wait and see approach on tariffs,"Getty MADISON, Wis. - Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin is withholding judgment for now on President Donald Trump's proposal to increase steel and aluminum tariffs. The proposal has generated broad opposition from Republicans, including Gov. Scott Walker, while liberal Democrats and unions have praised the move. Baldwin said Tuesday she wants to see all the details of the administration's plan first. Baldwin says she supports sending a ""strong message to bad actors"" like Russia and China, but she also fears a blanket tariff could start a trade war with allies like Canada and hurt Wisconsin manufacturers and the state's agricultural economy. Baldwin's two Republican challengers didn't take firm positions on Trump's plan. Republican Sen. Leah Vukmir's campaign manager says she applauds Trump fighting for better trade deals. And a spokesman for Delafield businessman Kevin Nicholson says he supports renegotiating trade deals to benefit the U.S.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2018/mar/12/leah-vukmir/Vukmir-misfires-on-Baldwin-trade-barb/,Economy,Polifact
1574,Trump's Tariffs Look Like a Self-Inflicted Wound,"There's a right way  and a wrong way  to help. Trade wars, President Donald Trump recently declared on Twitter, are good, and easy to win. But its questionable whether the presidents proposed tariffs -- a tax of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on imported aluminum -- will be a war or an act of friendly fire. As I recently wrote, tariffs are generally not a good way to promote domestic industry. They encourage American producers to hunker down behind the taxs protective wall, focusing on the captive local market instead of figuring out how to prevail in the rough-and-tumble of global competition. Forcing American consumers to use the domestic-made product might eventually result in American steel and aluminum becoming bywords for low quality. Theres also the danger that making metals more expensive will hurt a lot more U.S. manufacturers than it helps. The construction industry would take the biggest hit: Where the Pain Would Be Felt the Most Share of total U.S. steel use by industry Source: Statista.com Import taxes will tend to drive already exorbitant U.S. construction costs even higher, hurting commercial development around the country. It will also harm U.S. exporters. The U.S. makes a lot of internationally tradeable products that use steel -- aircraft, autos, appliances and industrial machinery. A lot of others use aluminum. Although the majority of what they use is produced locally -- the U.S. steel industry supplied about 70 percent of the domestic market in 2017 -- a tax on imports will allow American metal producers to charge more to companies like Boeing Co., General Motors Co. and Whirlpool Corp. Higher steel and aluminum company profits will therefore come at the expense of these other American manufacturers -- exporters like Caterpillar Inc. and Harley-Davidson Inc. are already warning that the tariff would put them at a competitive disadvantage in world markets. No wonder shares of these companies slid after the tariff plan was announced: That Didn't Feel So Great Indexed share performance of companies that might be hurt by tariffs Source: Bloomberg So Trumps ham-fisted attempts to protect one American industry seem likely to deal a blow to many others. This is the exact opposite of the increased international manufacturing prowess that Trump has promised. Defenders of the tariffs argue that steel and aluminum are important for national defense, and so need to be protected even at the cost of less martial industries. But military shipbuilders will be hurt by higher metals prices, as will makers of tanks, planes, guns and other crucial defense equipment. Nor will the tariffs bring back good jobs at steel and aluminum factories. Since 1990, production of metals in the U.S. has held roughly constant, but the number of people employed in the industry has fallen steadily: Look Elsewhere for the Growth Story of Tomorrow Industrial production of primary metal* Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Doing the Same With Fewer People Employment in primary metals production Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis The reason is technology. Productivity has improved, even as demand has stayed more or less constant. Mathematically, that means fewer jobs for steel and aluminum workers. Tariffs wont change that equation. If anything, by hurting downstream industries like car and equipment manufacturers, the new import taxes will probably kill more factory jobs than they save. So Trumps metals tariffs look likely to be a self-inflicted wound for the U.S. -- even if they dont spark retaliation from trading partners, and even if they dont weaken American alliances. If Trump wants to help the steel and aluminum industries, there are better ways to do it. Instead of letting U.S. metal-makers charge higher prices to other American industries, the government could focus on helping to raise exports. The reason domestic steel production hasnt grown isnt because of cheap imports; its the fact that the U.S. market hasnt grown. The U.S. is a mature economy with a lot of existing buildings, infrastructure and vehicles, meaning that its consumption of metal can be expected to grow only slowly. Countries in Asia and Africa, however, need lots of new steel to fuel their economic development. The U.S., which makes higher-quality steel than countries like China, could potentially be supplying much of those countries needs. Currently, U.S. steel companies command only 2 percent of world exports, compared with 24 percent by China. There are things the government could do to improve that situation, including export promotion, export loans and assistance for small producers looking to break into world markets. Selling more steel and aluminum abroad is a much better bet than trying to capture a bigger slice of a stagnating pie back home. So far, though, Trump has shown more interest in trade war for its own sake than in actually helping U.S. companies compete. Tariffs might make Trump and his diehard followers feel better, but theyll hurt more American pocketbooks than they benefit.

1664,CNNs Brianna Keilar Embarrasses NRA-Supporting Lawmaker Over Delta Discounts,"A Republican candidate for governor in Georgia tried to spread fake news on CNN Tuesday afternoon, but anchor Brianna Keilar didnt let him. Keilar, who gained notoriety for her remarkable Says who? moment with Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, repeatedly disputed a claim from State Sen. Michael Williams (R-GA) about Delta Air Lines discounts. Along with his fellow Republican gubernatorial candidate, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, Williams has threatened to punish Delta for eliminating its discount for National Rifle Association members in the wake of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting. During his appearance on CNN Tuesday, he argued that if Delta is going to give discounts to Planned Parenthood members, they should do the same for the NRA. One problem: Theres no evidence that there is a Planned Parenthood discount for Delta Air Lines. Where are you getting that, that Delta gives a discount to Planned Parenthood members? Keilar asked her guest. I need to be clear on this. You just indicated that they give discounts to Planned Parenthood members. I havent seen that anywhere. Ive seen allegations of that on right-wing blogs. Ive had no verification of that. We have people looking at that. Where are you getting that? Williams admitted that he looked it up on Google, but could not provide a source and said he still believes very firmly that its true. To be clear, we looked it up as well and it doesnt appear after some digging that weve been able to determine that that is actually factual, Keilar said. Youre indicating something that may not be true there. If youre making that argument, shouldnt you have your facts straight? Are you telling me Delta is not giving away discounts to left-leaning organizations, is that what youre telling me? No, you told me it was Planned Parenthood, she said. Theres no indication they are giving discounts to that organization is my point.

1899,Republican gubernatorial hopefuls debate in Amherst,"Three candidates seeking the Republican nomination to run against Governor Andrew Cuomo this fall appeared in Amherst Saturday morning, where they took turns taking shots at the incumbent and his policies, including the Buffalo Billion. The debate was hosted by Daemen College and sponsored by the Erie County Republican Committee. Part One of the Republican gubernatorial candidate debate hosted by Daemen College and sponsored by the Erie County Republican Committee. Erie County GOP Chairman Nick Langworthy makes the opening remarks. Part Two of the Republican gubernatorial candidate debate Saturday morning, February 10, hosted by Daemen College and sponsored by the Erie County Republican Committee. We continue with debate moderator Andrea Bozek asking a question. ""Nothing is more important to the Republican Party than defeating Andrew Cuomo,"" said Erie County GOP chairman Nick Langworthy in his opening remarks. ""It is the absolutely number one objective of the Erie County Republican Committee to do everything we can. We thought it was very important to bring these candidates to you. so you could hear them."" Former Erie County and City of Buffalo elected official Joel Giambra, longtime State Senator John DeFrancisco and former Housing Commissioner for the Pataki Administration Joe Holland took turns criticizing Governor Cuomo's Buffalo Billion program, an energy policy that bans hydrofracking, the state's taxes and regulations, ethical troubles in Albany and education policies including the Excelsior program. The criticism began with the Buffalo Billion. ""The Buffalo Billion, unfortunately, has been a tremendous public failure,"" said Giambra, a businessman who previously served as the Erie County Executive, Buffalo Comptroller and Buffalo Common Councilmember. ""What the governor attempted to do here was to gain political access, if you will, to Western New York because of the tremendous beating he took by (former gubernatorial candidate) Carl Paladino. This was his way of trying to find a way to ingratiate himself politically, using taxpayer dollars to fund a billion-dollar building that today sits, virtually, almost empty."" That building is the Tesla/Panasonic Gigafactory 2 factory in Buffalo's Riverbend neighborhood. Holland spoke of the factory while criticizing Cuomo for an energy policy that entirely eliminated hydrofracking as an option. ""Unfortunately, this governor has been colonized by the environmental lobby,"" he said. ""All of these policies, solar panel factories, it's not based on grassroots and an economically driven approach in order to create the kind of development that's needed. It's dictated by policies of the far left and that's unfortunate because it won't work."" John DeFrancisco, who hails from Syracuse, has spent the past 25 years in the State Senate and is giving up his seat to run, and with it his influential role as Deputy Majority Leader. He, too, considers Buffalo's Gigafactory 2 a Cuomo failure. ""The governor does things based upon the political benefit he is going to get,"" DeFrancisco said. ""He had a great news conference, thousands of jobs. There was nothing behind it. There was no clawbacks. There was no security that the taxpayer had, once he did that. And so, not thousands of jobs. It's down to 200."" DeFrancisco went on to say that Buffalo is not alone. ""Look at the Soraa project in Syracuse,"" he continued. ""A $90 million building sitting there empty. And you know what he wants to do? No penalties for them walking away."" Like DeFrancisco and Giambra, Holland is an Upstate New York resident, hailing from Auburn. He explained during the debate that he holds ""upstate roots but also downtown credibility."" ""I'm the only statewide candidate for governor that can put together that winning coalition,"" Holland said. ""I can do that, not only because I will make history as the first African-American Republican candidate for governor, but I also have a track record of service, of making a difference in the New York City area. Out of that comes a network of supporters I can cultivate to vote for me and move the numbers in a positive direction."" DeFrancisco, like Holland, thinks even New York City voters have acquired a ""Cuomo fatigue"" that may work to the Republican Party's advantage. He suggested Cuomo and New York City mayor Bill De Blasio are not on speaking terms. ""Just look at the papers over the summer, the 'summer from hell' with the subway system,"" he said. ""How does the governor deal with it? He doesn't say 'it's my problem, I've made some mistakes, I'm going to correct it.' He blames De Blasio."" The Republican hopefuls also noted the current corruption trial of former Cuomo aide Joseph Percoco during the debate. The overall tone of the debate was cordial, with no candidate attacking any other. Giambra did say he was the only candidate among the three with a record of cutting taxes and, after the debate, offered a hint of how he may position himself against one of his opponents. ""Mr. DeFrancisco has been in the Senate for a long time. He's voted for all these budgets. It's going to be very hard for him, I think, to be able to ask the voters to send him back to Albany to fix the problems that he helped create,"" Giambra said. DeFrancisco, following the debate, was asked if being a longtime lawmaker in a Legislature where many other have been disgraced with scandal might work against him. He believes voters will quickly realize he's not ""part of the machine."" ""If people watch what I have done over the years, as far as the advocacy against some of the things that have happened, I don't think they will take me in that light,"" he replied. The field of GOP contenders was reduced to three following Friday's surprise withdrawal from the race by Assembly Minority Leader Brian Kolb, who cited a desire to spend more time with family. ""This is going to be a competitive race for the Republican nomination,"" Holland said. ""At this point there are three candidates, two who have served in elected office. One is an Albany insider. What I bring to the race is the difference that's needed for the Republicans to win back the State House."" In his opening remarks, New York State Republican Chairman Edward Cox said New York State is the least business-friendly of all states in the nation and 11 years of policies under Democratic governors has worsened conditions and killed jobs. ""New York State is a blue state. But we are not Manhattan or West Side blue, we are blue collar blue. That's New York State,"" said Cox. ""New York State wants good jobs and Republican governors will bring good jobs to New York State.""",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/new-york/statements/2018/feb/16/edward-cox/new-york-state-leads-country-government-debt-resid/,Economy,Polifact

The index rose to 107.8, a three-point gain, with small businesses reporting high numbers in several key areas including compensation, profits, and sales trends. Main Street optimism is on a stratospheric trajectory thanks to recent tax cuts and regulatory changes. For years, owners have continuously signaled that when taxes and regulations ease, earnings and employee compensation increase, said NFIB President and CEO Juanita Duggan. The May report hit several records:  Compensation increases hit a 45-year high at a record net 35 percent.  Positive earnings trends reached a survey high at a net three percent.  Positive sales trends are at the highest level since 1995.  Expansion plans are the most robust in survey history. In another interesting marker, a net 19 percent of small business owners are planning price increases, the highest since 2008 and a signal of a strong economy. A net three percent reported positive profit trends, up four points and the best reading in the surveys history. In addition, a net 15 percent reported higher nominal sales in the past three months, up an astonishing seven points and the sixth consecutive strong month for sales. Small business owners are continuing an 18-month streak of unprecedented optimism which is leading to more hiring and raising wages, said NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg. While they continue to face challenges in hiring qualified workers, they now have more resources to commit to attracting candidates. Small business owners continue to hire with a seasonally-adjusted net 18 percent planning to create new jobs. Twenty-nine percent of owners have job openings for skilled workers, the third highest reading since 2000. Twelve percent have job openings for unskilled workers, with the strongest demand in the transportation, travel, communications, and utilities sector. To compete in the job market, 35 percent of owners reported increases in labor compensation to attract job applicants. The percentage of owners reporting capital outlays moved up one point to 62 percent, with 47 percent reporting spending on new equipment, 24 percent acquiring vehicles, and 16 percent improving expanded facilities. Thirty percent plan capital outlays in the next few months. Access to credit continues as a non-issue with 37 percent of owners reporting all credit needs were satisfied and 43 percent saying they were not interested in a loan, down seven points from last month and the lowest reading since 2007. Only one percent reported that financing was their top business problem. Owners planning to build inventories rose three points to a net four percent, the nineteenth positive reading in the past 20 months.

3298,Get big money out of California politics,"California has proudly declared itself the leader of the resistance, a progressive counter to the Trump administrations continual assault on the rule of law and the most vulnerable among us. However, for California to truly lead our nation forward, we need to create a real system of public financing for political campaigns in order to get big money, and the stink of potential corruption, out of our government. Last week, Gov. Jerry Brown signed the Disclose Act, a product of a multiyear, comprehensive effort to shine a light on dark money that has invaded our political system. I proudly endorsed the Disclose Act, but we must go further. There is no doubt in my mind that our democracy is in trouble. Big money in politics adds to public cynicism and subtracts from our faith in our form of government. In a democracy, the government is us. To lose faith in government means that we have lost faith in each other. This lack of faith rips apart the fabric of our civil society and allows the worst among us to rule. Budgets are statements of values, and, in the words of the late Sen. and Vice President Hubert Humphrey, the moral test of government is how it treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the aged; and those in the shadows of life, the sick, (and) the needy. I am afraid that our democracy is under significant assault because we are failing this moral test, even here in California, where we have the highest number and percentage of poor children in the country. People become cynical because the path to a brighter future is becoming more remote. Ninety percent of people born in the 1940s ended up doing better financially than their parents. But those born in the 1980s, the much-maligned Millennials, have only a 50-50 chance of doing better than their parents , despite being the best-educated generation in our history. While I fully support a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United, the Supreme Court decision that lifted limits on corporate and union political spending, that battle will likely take many years. Californians cannot afford to wait. In 2016, the pharmaceutical industry spent more than $100 million to prevent voters from regulating the price of prescription drugs  and won. The high cost of our elections means that people of modest means dont consider running for office. It also means that politicians who do run find themselves on a never-ending path of fundraising instead of governing. Politicians should be meeting with their constituents, listening to their aspirations and concerns, and taking these ideas back to the Capitol to craft sound, progressive and beneficial policy. Did you know that the maximum donation to a candidate for governor of California is $29,200, just for the primary election? One married couple can contribute more than $116,000 in the primary and general elections combined. We have a moral imperative to get this kind of money out of politics and create a clean system of public financing for campaigns. This isnt a partisan issue. The voters understand that something is rotten in politics, and sometimes that rottenness is enacted into law. Californians can improve our system of government by passing state legislation modeled after the Fair Elections Now Act, which is pending federal legislation supported by Common Cause, Sen. Bernie Sanders and many others. A statewide campaign-finance law should set hard limits on large-dollar donors, offer public financing and establish requirements for candidate participation in debates. This would help reduce the cynicism and malaise affecting our youngest voters and encourage them to engage in the act of participatory democracy. If Californians organize, we can get big money out of our political system and put direct democracy back into the hands of the people. As California goes, so goes the nation.

4248,Full Transcript and Video: Trumps News Conference in New York,"Now I knew the process very well, probably better than anybody. I had to get permits for this building and many of the buildings I built, all of the buildings I built in Manhattan and many other places. And I will tell you that the consultants are rich people. They go around making it very difficult. They lobby Congress. They lobby state government, city governments to make it very difficult so that you have to hire consultants and that you have to take years and pay them a fortune. So we are streamlining the process, and we wont be having so much of that anymore. No longer will we allow the infrastructure of our magnificent country to crumble and decay. While protecting the environment, we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, railways, waterways, tunnels and highways. We will rebuild our country with American workers, American iron, American aluminum, American steel. We will create millions of new jobs and make millions of American dreams come true. Our infrastructure will again be the best in the world. We used to have the greatest infrastructure anywhere in the world. And today, we are like a third-world country. We are literally like a third-world country. Our infrastructure will again be the best. And we will restore the pride in our communities, our nation. And all over the United States will be proud again. So I want to thank everybody for being here. God bless you. God bless the United States. And if you have any questions, we have Mick. You could come up here, please. Come on up. Mick Mulvaney. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. REPORTER: Why do you think these C.E.O.s are leaving your manufacturing council? TRUMP: Because theyre not taking their jobs seriously as it pertains to this country. But we want jobs, manufacturing in this country. If you look at some of those people that you are talking about, they are outside of the country. They are having a lot of their product made outside. If you look at Merck as an example, take a look  excuse me, excuse me  take a look at where their product is made. Its made outside of our country. We want products made in the country. Now I have to tell you, some of the folks that will leave, theyre leaving out of embarrassment, because they make their products outside. And I have been lecturing them, including the gentleman that you are referring to, about you have to bring it back to this country. You cant do it necessarily in Ireland and all of these other places. You have to bring this work back to this country. Thats what I want. I want manufacturing to be back into the United States so that American workers can benefit. REPORTER: Why did you wait so long  [cross talk] TRUMP: I didnt wait long. I didnt wait long. I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct, not make a quick statement. The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement but you dont make statements that direct unless you know the facts. It takes a little while to get the facts. You still dont know the facts. It is a very, very important process to me. It is a very important statement. So I dont want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement. I want to know the facts. If you go back to my statement, I brought it. I brought it. [cross talk] As I said, remember, Saturday, we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence. It has no place in America. And then I went on from there. Here is the thing. Excuse me. Take it nice and easy. Here is the thing. When I make a statement, I like to be correct. I want the facts. This event just happened. In fact, a lot of the event didnt happen yet as we were speaking. This event just happened. Before I make a statement, I need the facts. So I dont want to rush into a statement. So making the statement when I made it was excellent. In fact, the young woman, who I hear is a fantastic young woman, and it was on NBC, her mother wrote me and said through I guess Twitter, social media, the nicest things. And I very much appreciated that. I hear she was a fine, really actually, an incredible young woman. Her mother, on Twitter, thanked me for what I said. And honestly, if the press were not fake and if it was honest, the press would have said what I said was very nice. But unlike you  [cross talk]... and unlike the media, before I make a statement, I like to know the facts. [cross talk] How about a couple of infrastructure questions. REPORTER: The C.E.O. of Walmart said you missed a critical opportunity to help bring the country together.

4550,Donald Trump Ohio Rally Speech: Read Full Transcript,"President Donald Trump returned to Youngstown, Ohio, a state that was arguably key to his success over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. Although the President finds himself embroiled in controversies and policy fights in Washington, D.C., that range from the Russia investigation to health care, those issues were largely left behind in the beltway. Tonight Im back in the center of the American heartland, far away from the Washington swamp to spend time with thousands of true American patriots, he told the crowd, as cheers of drain the swamp filled the arena. And, despite reports of infighting and recent staff shakeups in the White House, Trump touted the ease of being President, pushing back against claims that he has not acted presidential. Its much easier, by the way, to act presidential than what were doing here tonight, believe me, he said. And I said with the exception of the late great Abraham Lincoln, I can be more presidential than any president thats ever held this office. That I can tell you. Its real easy. But sadly, we have to move a little faster than that. Read the full transcript below: Thank you, Melania, America loves our First Lady, thank you. I am thrilled to be back in the great state of Ohio right here with the incredible men and women of Youngstown. What an amazing few days its been. On Saturday i was in Virginia with thousands of brave men and women of the United States Military. Do we love the united states military? We commissioned the newest, largest, and most advanced aircraft carrier in the history of our nation, the USS Gerald R. Ford into the great American fleet. (Cheers). Then yesterday i was in West Virginia with almost 50,000 of our most impressive young Americans. They are young men who learned to cherish words like duty, honor, god, and country, the Boy Scouts. Then only a few hours ago the senate approved a vote to begin debating the repealing and replacing the Obamacare disaster. [ cheers and applause ] Finally. You think thats easy? Thats not easy. Were now one step closer to liberating our citizens from this Obamacare nightmare, and delivering great health care for the American people. Were gonna do that too. And now tonight im back in the center of the American heartland, far away from the Washington swamp to spend time with thousands of true American patriots. [Chants of drain the swamp] We have spent the entire week celebrating with the hard working men and women who are helping us make America great again. Im here this evening to cut through the fake news filter and to speak straight to the American people. fake news. fake, fake, fake news. [Chants of drain the swamp from arena]. Boy oh boy, people. Is there anyplace thats more fun, more exciting and safer than a Trump rally? Where the hell did he come from? this has been a difficult week for the media because I forced them to travel with us all around the country and spend time with tens of thousands of proud Americans who believe in defending our values, our culture, our borders, our civilization, and our great American way of life. [cheers from crowd], Everyone in this arena is united by their love, and you know that. Do we know that. Everyone. United by their love for this country and their loyalty to one another, their loyalty to its people. [Cheers] And we want people to come into our country who can love us and cherish us and be proud of America and the American flag. [cheers] We believe that schools should teach our children to have pride in our history and respect for that great American flag. We all believe in the rule of law, and we support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. Thank you. Thank you for being here. [cheers. We celebrate our military and believe the American armed forces are the greatest force for peace and justice in the history of the world, and by the way, theyre getting a lot greater fast. A lot greater. You saw our budget. were ordering billions and billions of dollars of new ships and new planes and equipment for our great soldiers.we are building it up. Theres rarely been a time where we needed the protection of our incredible military more than right now, right here, and thats what were going to do. We believe in freedom, self-government, and individual rights. We cherish and defend  thank you, it looks like its in very good shape  our Second Amendment. congratulations. [cheers from crowd] Yes, our Second Amendment is very, very sound again. that would have been gonzo. It would have been gone, but i never had a doubt. We support the constitution of the United States and believe that judges should interpret the constitution as written and not make up new meaning for what they read. And finally, we believe that family and faith, not government and bureaucracy, are the foundation of our society. Youve heard me say it before on the campaign trail and Ill say it again tonight. In America we dont worship government. We worship God. [cheers from crowd]. Tonight were going to set aside the cynics and the critics because we know exactly why they are so angry and so bitter. Day by day, week by week we are restoring our governments allegiance to its people, to its citizens, to the people that we all love. We are keeping our promises to the people, and yes, we are putting finally, finally, finally we are putting America first. [Chants of USA from crowd]. After years and years of sending our jobs and our wealth to other countries, we are finally standing up for our workers and for our companies. [cheers from crowd] After spending billions of dollars defending other nations borders, we are finally defending our borders. [Cheers and chants of build that wall from the crowd]. Dont even think about it, we will build the wall. Dont even think about it. I watched the media as they say, well, he just had some fun during the campaign on the wall. That wasnt fun, folks. Were building that wall, and walls do work and were going to have great people come into our country, but were not gonna to put ourselves through the problems that weve had for so many years. [Cheers]. After decades of rebuilding foreign nations, we are finally going to rebuild our nation. [Crowd boos at something]. Theyre pointing to a protester. Honestly, if you dont point, nobodys even going to know hes here. Weak voice, weak voice, dont worry. [Chants of USA from crowd. Boy,hes a young one. hes going back home to mommy. Oh is he in trouble. Hes in trouble. Hes in trouble. And ill bet his mommy voted for us, right? [Cheers] By the way, so this morning im watching Fox News [crowd cheers] And they had some people on, and these were democrats that voted for trump. And they had this on. And so far if anything, theyve gotten even more committed. But they had a man on this morning  they had a man on this morning who was a Democrat his whole life. He voted as a democrat, but he voted for  I say us, I dont say me. He voted for us in the last election 2016. [cheers] And they said to him, so if the election were held now again, what would you do? And he effectively said, man, would I vote for Trump again, even faster. So his name is Gino Defabio. where is Gino? Gino, get over here, Gino. Whoa. Gino Defabio! [Defabio comes onstage as crowd cheers]. Geno: Anybody who knows me, friends of mine, people who love me its worse for them, they know how its been since President Trump started running for the election. How much I supported this guy, how much I love this guy, this guys got something, hes the real deal. Everybody else came and said were gonna fight for you, this is Youngstown, Mr. President, but this is also the Steel Valley. Every one of these people love you, Sir. And I dont want to sound silly or anything, but i thought what would I say to the President if I ever got to meet him, which this is an honest to god over the top moment for me. I thought you know Im just going to tell him something. And sir, like I said, thank you for Justice Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. Right? That started it all. And then I apologize, I said Mr. President, thank you for Melania. Could we have a more outstanding First Lady? Im probably going to be in trouble with my wife, but God bless that woman. And then last thing I said and I dont think he thought I was going to take this much time but anybody that knows me, this is gonna happen, I said thank you sir for keeping the promises you made. To these 12,000 people and to the country. In my recommendation sir, look what you could do in the bastion of the Democratic party. I dont think theres anyone except Cayahuga County who is more Democratic than us. Look who you could draw. I go back to Washington, I would tell the Republicans and the Democrats, Look. I am going to go do my rallies. You got the agenda. Those people are voting for me and mine. Do what you want. Pass my agenda or were going out on the road. Thank you sir. An absolute honor. Thank you sir. Trump: Thank you, Gino. What a man. I watched him this morning, I said, we got to find this guy, hes just a great person. Always a Democrat, now its gone. Ill tell you what, I rode through your beautiful roads coming up from the airport, and I was looking at some of those big once incredible job-producing factories, and my wife, Melania, said what happened? I said, those jobs have left Ohio. Theyre all coming back. Theyre all coming back. [cheers from crowd].Dont move. Dont sell your house. Dont sell your house. Remember, i got a lot of credit. This is hard to believe but the press gave me a lot of credit because a number of years ago I said this is the time to buy a house during one of my speeches. I said, go out and buy, and they did this big story, Trump predicted. Let me tell you folks in Ohio and in this area, dont sell your house. Dont sell your house. Do not sell it. Were going to get those values up. Were going to get those jobs coming back, and were going to fill up those factories or rip them down and build brand new ones. Its going to happen. [Cheers from crowd] Were gonna have it so that Americans can once again speak the magnificent words of Alexander Hamilton, here the people govern. Political correctness for me is easy. Sometimes they say he doesnt act Presidential. And I say, hey look, great schools, smart guy, its so easy to act presidential but thats not gonna to get it done. In fact, I said its much easier, by the way, to act presidential than what were doing here tonight, believe me. And I said  and I said with the exception of the late great Abraham Lincoln, i can be more presidential than any President thats ever held this office. That I can tell you. Its real easy. [Cheers] But sadly, we have to move a little faster than that. We will never be beholden to the lobbyists or the special interests. We will never be silenced by the media. I want to protect America, and i want to protect the citizens of america. Your hopes are my hopes. Your dreams are my dreams. Ive had a great successful career. Ive built a great, great business. This is the only thing that matters. This is the only thing that matters. There is nothing else. Your future is what Im fighting for each and every day. Here is just a small sample of what we have accomplished in just our first six months in office. And Ill say this and they always like to say,well, I dont know. But I think that with few exceptions no president has done anywhere near what weve done in his first six months. Not even close. But they dont let you know. They dont want to write about it. That unemployment last month hit a 16-year low. Since my election, weve added much more than 1 million jobs. Think of that. And remember I came in and some people said, dont say that. Id say, what do you have to lose? I talked about the inner city, and I talked about the crime and the problems and the lack of education, and I talked to my African-American friends and I said, vote for me, what the hell do you have to lose? Do you remember that? The Hispanic, the African-American, the inner cities. So now it just came out, African-Americans and teenagers are enjoying their lowest unemployment since just after the turn of the millennium.[ cheers from crowd] Thats pretty good, right? weve eliminated burdenensome regulations at record speed and many, many more are coming off. And boy, have we put those coal miners and coal back on the map. Youve seen that, havent you? And all other forms of energy. Weve achieved a historic increase in defense spending to get our troops the support they so richly deserve. We have signed new legislation to hold federal workers accountable for the care they provide to our great, great veterans. Veterans Accountability Act, theyve been trying to get that done for many, many, many years, even decades. And you understand why it was tough, but we got it done. In fact, our secretary is with us tonight, David Shulkin, and we have some just incredible people here tonight, some of whom youve already met. But the job theyre doing for the vets, having to do with choice, having to do with doctors, having to do with not having to wait online for days and days and days and getting sicker and sicker and sicker, where you could be taken care of immediately. Now you go out and you see a doctor. To protect American jobs and workers, I withdrew the united states from both the Trans-Pacific Partnership potential disaster and the job-killing Paris Climate Accord. Believe me. And if we dont negotiate a great deal with Mexico and Canada, we will terminate NAFTA and well start all over again. You remember when I was in Youngstown, I said we will either renegotiate NAFTA or well terminate it. So lets see what happens, but were right now negotiating with the heads of Mexico, a good man, the President, and the Prime Minister of Canada, a good man. Lets see what happens. But we will no longer be the foolish people. We will no longer be the stupid people that get taken care of so badly by our politicians because they dont know what theyre doing. [cheers from crowd] We will always work with our friends and partners, but we will never again sacrifice Ohio jobs or jobs from any state in our union to enrich other countries which has been what is happening to this country. [Chants of USA] And by the way, while were on it, the Iran deal which may be the single worst deal Ive ever seen drawn by anybody, if that deal doesnt conform to what its supposed to conform to, theres going to be big, big problems for them. That I can tell you. Youre going to see that. Believe me. You would have thought when that deal was made by Secretary Kerry, maybe the worst negotiator ive ever seen, you would have thought that Iran would have said, thank you, United States. We cant believe you gave us between $100 billion and $150 billion when they were ready to fail. We cant believe you gave us $1.7 billion in cash. You know what that looks like? You would have thought they would have said, thank you, United States, we really love you very much. Instead, theyve become emboldened. That wont take place much longer. [cheers from crowd] The great president from the state of Ohio, William McKinley and you know William McKinley, does anybody know who the hell he is? Do you know who he is? William McKinley understood that when America protects our workers and our industries, we open up a higher and better destiny for our people. We dont protect our people. We dont protect. Trade comes in, goods come in. I was with Harley-Davidson, a great company from Wisconsin. Who has a Harley-Davidson? A lot of you. [Cheers from crowd] They came to the White House and they said to me, yeah, its tough going outside of the United States. Were doing great in the United States but when we sell a motorcycle to certain countries, we have as much as as a 100% tax to pay. And I said, tell me, when they sell back to us, meaning reciprocal, so when they sell back to us, what tax do we charge them? The answer is zero. [Boos from crowd] Those days are going to be over very soon. [Cheers from crowd] unfortunately, like everything else, there are so many restrictions on doing whats right for our country, theres so much red tape, but dont worry, were getting through it. The red tape, you would think we could just do it. Wouldnt you think you could say, hey, you charge us 100%, were going to charge you 100%? Then either youll get the money or youll both drop it,right? We cant do that. Weve got to go back to Congress, who other than health care today, has been made some very bad deals, okay? So were going to start enriching our country. Were going to start bringing back our jobs, and we will be fools no longer, folks. Well be fools no longer. Every single President on Mt. Rushmore  now heres what i do. Id ask whether or not you think I will some day be on Mt. Rushmore, but, but heres the problem. If I did it joking, totally joking, having fun, the fake news media will say, he believes he should be on Mt. Rushmore. So I wont say it, okay? I wont say it. But every president  theyll say it anyway tomorrow. Trump thinks he should be on Mt. Rushmore. Isnt that terrible? What a group. What a dishonest group of people, Ill tell you. [Cheers from crowd] And you know the funny thing is that you would think theyd want to see our country be great again. You would really think so. But they dont. Some day theyll explain it to me why. Every president on Mt. Rushmore believed in protecting American industry. We have to protect our industry. And now we are going to start, we are reclaiming our heritage as a manufacturing nation again. Bob Kraft, the owner of the New England patriots, I dont know if you like New England but they have a hell of a team. [Boos from crowd] Thats okay. But he came to the Oval Office and he brought a sheet with him that just came out. Manufacturing enthusiasm in the United States is at an all-time high. Isnt that great? To me thats so great. because were going to bring back our jobs,bring back our wealth, and we are going to bring back our dreams, and we are going to bring back, once again our sovereignty as a nation. As a nation. [Chants of USA from crowd] Since I took office we have cut illegal immigration on our southern border by record numbers. 78%. [Chants of build that wall from crowd] Record, record numbers. And in fact, the ICE, folks ill tell you what, and the border patrol police, they are phenomenal people. Theyre working with General Kelly. And just so you understand, weve already started fixing much of the good wall thats already there. Weve already started fixing it.but we are breaking records. And it was actually told to me the other day by somebody in Mexico thats very high up, said its incredible because their southern border is getting very little traffic. Nobody is coming anymore because they know they cant get through our southern border. So they dont even come. [Cheers from crowd] Never again will America surrender the security of our people, the safety of our communities or the sovereignty of our nation. We are cracking down hard on the foreign criminal gangs that have brought illegal drugs, violence, horrible bloodshed to peaceful neighborhoods all across our country. We are throwing MS-13 the hell out of here so fast. You know, were actually  hard to believe that were talking about our great country. We are actually liberating towns and cities. We are liberating  people are screaming from their windows, thank you, thank you to the border patrol and to General Kellys great people that come in and grab the thugs and throw them the hell out. We are liberating our towns and we are liberating our cities. Can you believe we have to do that? [Chants of build that wall wall from crowd] Earlier in year and immigration and customs enforcement conducted the largest single raid of transnational gangs in the history of our country. We are dismantling and destroying the bloodthirsty criminal gangs, and well, I will just tell you in, were not doing it in a politicly correct fashion. Were doing it rough. Our guys are rougher than their guys. I asked one of our great generals, how tough are our people? How tough are they? He said, sir, you dont want to know about it. Then I saw one guy come out, a customs officer who is a monster. I said, so general, you think i could take that guy in a fight? He said, Mr. President, sir i dont even want to think about it. I said youre right, actually. We have tough people. Our people are tougher than their people. Our people are tougher and stronger and meaner and smarter than the gangs. One by one we are finding the illegal gang members, drug dealers, thieves, robbers, criminals and killers. And we are sending them the hell back home where they came from. And once they are gone, we will never let them back in. Believe me. The predators and criminal aliens who poison our communities with drugs and prey on innocent young people, these beautiful, beautiful,innocent young people will, will find no safe haven anywhere in our country. And youve seen the stories about some of these animals. They dont want to use guns, because its too fast and its not painful enough. So theyll take a young, beautiful girl, 16, 15, and others and they slice them and dice them with a knife because they want them to go through excruciating pain before they die. And these are the animals that weve been protecting for so long. Well, theyre not being protected any longer,folks. And that is why my administration is launching a nationwide crackdown on sanctuary cities. American cities should be sanctuaries for law-abiding Americans, for people that look up to the law, for people that respect the law, not for criminals and gang members that we want the hell out of our country. [Cheers from crowd] Sanctuary cities legislation has passed the house,along with Kates Law, named for Kate Steinle, who was brutally killed by a five-time deported illegal immigrant. We are asking the Senate to vote on sanctuary cities and Kates Law legislation. Weve got to get it passed. The Trump administration has the backs of our ICE Officers, our border patrol agents. And yes, our great police officers. And we have their backs 100%. We are going to also protect them, like they protect us. This month in Chicago, there have been more than 2 homicide victims per day. What the hell is going on in Chicago? Better tell that Mayor to get tough, because its not working what theyre doing. We are going to get criminals off our streets. And we are going to make America safe again. We also strongly believe that our borders must always be closed to terrorism and extremism. We dont want radical Islamic terrorists in our country. Weve seen the total devastation in Europe. And the attack from New York to Boston to San Bernardino. Exactly one year ago next month I came right here to Youngstown to deliver a major address on how my administration would protect our country from terrorism and radical Islamic terrorism. We only want to admit those into our country who share our values, who love our people and who always will love our people. We dont want people coming into our country who have bad intentions even before they start. [Cheers from crowd] We also believe that those seeking to immigrate into our country should be able to support themselves financially and should not be able to use welfare for themselves or the household for a period of at least five years. As we speak, we are working with two wonderful senators, Tom Cotton and David Purdue, to create a new immigration system for America. Instead of todays low-skill system, just a terrible system where anybody comes in. People that have never worked, people that are criminals, anybody comes in. We want a merit-based system. One that protects workers our workers, our taxpayers, and one that protects our economy. We want it merit-based. We want people that work really hard in their country and that are going to come into our country and work really, really hard. We dont want people that come into our country and immediately go on welfare and stay there for the rest of their lives. Were not going to do it. We are working every single day to move the legislation that serves the interests of the American people. As we discussed earlier, at the very top of the list is health care reform. With Obamacare, the Washington obstructionists, meaning Democrats, made big promising to the Smerican people. And every single promise they made turned out to be a lie. I can have your doctor. You can have your plan. Do you remember? 28 times. You can have your doctor. You can have your plan. I know Democrats who heard that and they would have never have voted for it but they voted for it because they believed the lies of President Obama. For seven years every Republican running for office promised to repeal and replace in disastrous law. Now they must keep their promise. The Senate is working not only to repeal Obamacare but to deliver great health care for the American people. Any senator who votes against repeal and replace is telling America that they are fine with the Obamacare nightmare, and I predict theyll have a lot of problems. In West Virginia, recent premiums have gone up 169% since Obamacare went into effect. In Alaska over 200%. And the deductibles have gone through the roof. Youll never even get to use it. In Missouri, premiums have shot up 145% under Obamacare. In Pennsylvania the cost of Obamacare insurance has more than doubled, and the coverage has become horrific. Its time for Democrats to stop resisting. Thats their term. Resist. Resist. They have to do, finally, whats right for the American people. But probably well do it ourselves. Because today we won 51 to 50 and didnt get one Democrat vote. Think of that. [Cheers from crowd] My administration is working every single day to heed and honor the will of the voters. That includes working on one of the biggest tax cuts in American history. And actually if I get what I want it will be the single biggest tax cut in American history. We have the highest taxes anywhere in the world, and this will really bring them down to one of the lowest. And we really have no choice. We will have growth. We will have everything that weve dreamed of having. Its time to let Americans keep more of their own money. Its time to bring new companies to our shores and to create a new era of growth, prosperity and wealth. We want millions of Americans to be lifted from welfare to work and from dependence to independence. One of the ways we will put more americans to work is by rebuilding our nations crumbling infrastructure. That is why I have called on legislators to pass a bill that generates $1 trillion in new infrastructure investments. Were going to fix our roads our bridges our tunnels our airports. We are going to fix all of the things that once made us great. And we are going to use American iron, American steel, American aluminum. We will buy American and will hire, finally, American. We want once again to have the best infrastructure. The best schools, the best jobs, the best factories. And we want products that proudly carry the label made in the USA. We want this country that we love so much, America, to be strong, proud and free. Which means America must also be united. Because when America is united, America is totally unstoppable. Although Ill be totally honest with you even if its not united were unstoppable so dont worry. Were gonna to be unstoppable either way but it would be nice, wouldnt it? Our small differences are nothing compared to our common history, common values and common future. Wes hare one heart, one home and one glorious destiny. Now it is up to us to preserve the birth right of freedom and justice, the birth right of prosperity that our ancestors won for us with their sweat, with their sweat, with their blood, with their work, with their muscle, with their brain. They won it for us and were gonna make it bigger and better and stronger than it ever was before. Its time to look past the old divisions. Theyre tired, really tired, politicians. And the stale debates of the past, and to finally come together as one nation under god. We have no choice. We cannot and never will back down. We will never, ever give up. We cannot fail. And if we remember what unites us, then I promise you we will not fail. We cannot fail. We will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, god bless you, god bless the state of Ohio.

5244,New York State Assembly,"Utica  The three Assemblymembers representing Herkimer County  Anthony Brindisi of Utica, Brian Miller of New Hartford, and Marc Butler of Newport say the news that a dozen beer fermentation tanks currently being transported down the Erie Canal to the Genesee Brewing Company in Rochester were made in China with nearly $10 million in State Economic Development dollars when upstate companies like Feldmeier Manufacturing Inc. in Little Falls could have done the work is deeply troubling. The fermentation tanks going down the Erie Canal are literally on a slow boat from China. It disgusts me to know that state economic development dollars were used to support a project where goods were manufactured in China, when we have companies like Feldmeier Equipment that produce products like this right in the Mohawk Valley. New York should put its money where its mouth is and support our state workers and state companies first, before they ship taxpayers money right out the door to China, Brindisi said. It simply makes no sense to export economic development dollars to China, when by definition this funding is supposed to grow jobs here in New York. New York has many long-time manufacturers like Feldmeier that are more than willing to produce quality products, and these companies deserve a chance to do business with the state, Miller said. As we struggle to improve the economy of upstate New York, I think this administration has missed a tremendous opportunity to secure employment opportunities here in Little Falls and the Mohawk Valley. Im truly disappointed that a highly regarded company like Feldmeier has been by-passed by this process, and in particular when state funding is a part of the project. We must take steps to insure that does not happen again in the Mohawk Valley or anywhere in New York State, Butler said. It is extraordinarily disappointing in light of all of the efforts my partners in government and I are putting toward keeping jobs local and invigorating the upstate economy that more effort did not go into ensuring these incentives went to Feldmeier, a company that has been in Little Falls for more than six decades, said Little Falls Mayor Mark Blask. Brindisi says the Buy New York Act (A.5510) he is sponsoring, which is supported by Miller and Butler, would require state agencies to give preference to buying goods and services produced in New York State when handing out tax dollars, as well as requiring the use of New York State iron, steel, and manufactured products for many government contracts. Enclosed is the text of the letter the three Assembly members have written on the issue to Governor Andrew Cuomo and Empire State Development President, CEO and Commissioner Howard Zemsky: Dear Governor Cuomo and Commissioner Zemsky: While it has been exciting to see the interest generated in the Erie Canal over the recent shipment of beverage tanks to the North American Brewery Facility in Rochester, the event has generated some strong concerns for us here in Herkimer County and the Mohawk Valley. As you know, the tanks were manufactured in China and then shipped here for delivery. We believe you can understand that the fanfare for this event was less than enthusiastic in the City of Little Falls, where Feldmeier Equipment, Inc., has a production facility that specializes in tanks of this nature. While there have been statements that Feldmeier did not submit a bid for the project, we are led to believe the opposite is true. In fact, we are absolutely convinced that Feldmeier submitted a proposal for the project and had asked for your support. Gentlemen, this was a $50 million project which included approximately $9.5 million in state assistance ($4.5 million in performance based Excelsior Jobs Program Tax credits and up to $5 million in Upstate Revitalization Initiative) assistance provided by the taxpayers of New York State, Herkimer County and the residents of the City of Little Falls. We feel we must express our surprise and disappointment that there were no conditions placed on the expenditure of this state funding. This project had the potential to be a great win for New York with the attention it drew to the canal, the development of additional brewing capacity for the Rochester area, and the production of the new tanks for an upstate New York Company. Feldmeier has an outstanding reputation for this kind of work and has, in fact, done other work for the Genesee Brewing Company in Rochester. As things now stand, we must express our strong disappointment that this highly-regarded local company was not given more consideration in this project. We would hope, in the future, New York companies and businesses will receive stronger support from this administration. Sincerely, Assemblyman Marc Butler Assemblyman Anthony Brindisi Assemblyman Brian Miller",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/new-york/statements/2017/jun/02/anthony-brindisi/state-money-was-not-used-buy-beer-tanks-genesee-br/,Economy,Polifact

In addition, of the more than 1,200 employees affected by the fire, approximately 400 returned to work just one week after the devastating event. In the days and weeks that followed, the State worked with Gap officials to determine next steps for the company, its employees and the Fishkill community. After weighing relocation options, Gap Inc. decided to remain in New York State, building a temporary pop up facility with $2.65 million in state funding.

9641,"Transcript: Donald Trump's full remarks in Des Moines, Iowa","Donald Trump arrives to speak at Joni Ernst's Roast and Ride at the Iowa State Fairgrounds, in Des Moines, Iowa, on Aug. 27. | AP Photo Transcript: Donald Trump's full remarks in Des Moines, Iowa Donald Trump's remarks prepared for delivery at Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst's Roast and Ride in Des Moines, Iowa. Thank you. I am thrilled to be here in Iowa among so many good friends. Story Continued Below Iowa is fortunate to have some of the best and most dedicated public servants in the country  including Governor Terry Branstad, Lt. Governor Kim Reynolds, State GOP Chairman Jeff Kauffman, Senator Chuck Grassley and, of course, our great host, Senator Joni Ernst. What an incredible roster. I also want to take a moment to thank the Bikers who have been so good to me throughout this campaign. I cant tell you how much it means to me. They are fantastic people who truly love our country. More than anything, today, I want to express my gratitude to our amazing Veterans. We will not let you down. Together, we are going to win this state in November  and we are going to win the White House for the American people. The White House will become the Peoples House. We will tackle and fix the problems that have gone unsolved for years: failing schools, crumbling infrastructure, broken borders, bloated bureaucracy, wasteful spending, and a government that just doesnt work. This is a campaign about big ideas designed to help everyday people. These are the people who work hard but who dont have a voice. Its also a campaign about restoring honesty and accountability to government service. The whole world has been shocked by the continuing revelations regarding Hillary Clinton and her pay-for-play State Department. Now it was just announced that her important calendar records will not be released to the public until after the election  more protection from a corrupt government. As Ive said many times in recent days, its hard to tell where the Clinton Foundation ends, and where the State Department begins. The Clinton Corruption scandals have been a sad time for America. The illegal server, the foreign hacking, the deleted emails, the secret schedules, the lying to Congress. Its all just too much. How much more can voters take? Hillary Clinton thinks shes entitled to be President  she thinks that shes above the law. But the truth is the opposite: her criminal conduct at home, and her failed interventions overseas, simply make her unfit to serve in the Oval Office. I believe America is ready to turn the page on this sordid past. We dont want another 4 years of Obama or Clinton Controversies: theyre not only dangerous but, frankly, exhausting to the people. How do you even keep up with them all? The Clintons have had their time on the stage but now its time to close that chapter in the history book and open a new one. That is why this is such an exciting year to be a Republican, and to vote Republican. This year, the GOP is offering the voters a chance to break-up the corrupt establishment and to create a New American Future. This chance will never come again. The Big Banks and Wall Street donors who want nothing to change are throwing millions and millions at my opponent. These are the same people who paid Bill and Hillary Clinton $150 million for speeches. Hillary Clintons campaign is all about protecting the powerful. Our campaign is about protecting those who have no power. Together, we are going to give working people a voice for the first time in a very, very long time. Lets talk about what that means. For our Veterans, it means a guarantee that they can seek medical care at either a VA facility or at a private medical doctor. Never again will we allow a Veteran to die waiting for the care they need. We will protect those who protect us. At the center of our change agenda is also a plan to fix our rigged economy. The government just revised the growth numbers for last quarter down again  its now only 1.1 percent. Thats not just bad, its catastrophic. Were going to Make America Grow Again. That begins with supporting our family farms right here in Iowa. Family farms are the backbone of this country. We are going to end the EPA intrusion into your family homes and your family farms. We are going to protect the Renewable Fuel Standard, eliminate job-killing regulations like the Waters of the U.S. rule, and provide desperately-needed tax relief. Almost 97% of farms in this country are family-owned and family-managed. Its not only a great American tradition, but a vital component of Americas economic and national security. Yet, Hillary Clinton wants to shut down family farms just like she wants to shut down the mines and the steelworkers. She will do this not only through radical regulation, but also by raising taxes on family farms  and all businesses  to rates as high as nearly 50 percent. Adding to the pain, she will tax family farms again at death by as much as 45 percent. On top of that, her anti-energy agenda will drive up the cost of energy  another attack on agriculture. We are going to end this war on the American farmer. That includes our plan to lower the tax rate on family farms down to 15 percent, and to stop the double-taxation of family farms at death  helping to ensure that the family farm tradition in Iowa continues to thrive and flourish. My economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs, jobs, jobs. I am asking for the support of all Americans who want more opportunity, higher wages, safe communities, competent leadership, and honest government. We are going to send the special interests packing, and we are going to once again have a government of, by, and for the people. Republicans are the Party of Lincoln. Which brings me to a subject that is so important and personal for me. Nothing means more to me than working to make our party the home of the African-American vote once again. There are millions of African-Americans in this country who have succeeded so greatly and who deserve a government that protects and honors their incredible contribution. But we also have to talk about the millions of African-Americans who remain trapped in poverty and failing schools. Ive spoken a lot in recent days about the deplorable conditions in many of our inner cities. As a father, as a builder, as an American, it offends my sense of right and wrong to see anyone living in such conditions. Almost 40 percent of African-American children are living in poverty  including 45 percent of children under the age of six. In Detroit, half of its residents do not work. In Milwaukee, almost 4 in 10 African-American men between the age of 24-54 are not employed. More than 6,000 African-Americans are the victims of murder every year. Just yesterday, the cousin of NBA star Dwayne Wade was the victim of a tragic shooting in Chicago. She was the mother of 4, and was killed while pushing her infant child in a stroller. It breaks our hearts. This shouldnt happen in America. We send our thoughts and our prayers to the family, and we also promise to fight for a better tomorrow. Across Chicago, more than 2,700 have been shooting victims since January of this year. We cannot, as a society, tolerate this level of violence and suffering in our own cities. Those who would deny that this is a national crisis  a crisis requiring urgent action  have no business running for elected office. Failed Democratic policies  the policies of Hillary Clinton  have created this high crime and crushing poverty. In so many communities under Democratic control, we have bad schools, no jobs, high crime, and no hope. It cant get any worse. To those suffering, I say: vote for Donald Trump and I will fix it. What do you have to lose? Let me also tell you what you have to gain: millions of jobs, better schools and safe communities. By the way, how quickly people have forgotten that Hillary Clinton called black youth super-predators, and how insulted they were. I am running to offer a better future  to the citizens of Detroit, Baltimore, Chicago, and all across this great land. African-Americans have given so much to this country. Theyve fought and died in every war since the Revolution. Theyve lifted up the conscience of our nation in the Civil Rights movement. Theyve sacrificed so much for the national good. Now is the time to put a new agenda into action that expands opportunity, ensures equality, and that protects the rights of each and every citizen. This includes one of the most important rights of all: the right to live in safety. I will work with communities, with police, and with federal law enforcement, to make communities safe and secure for all of our people. We are also going to end the discrimination that traps parents and kids in failing government schools. The Republican Party is the Party of School Choice. There is another civil rights issue we need to talk about, and thats the issue of immigration enforcement. Every time an African-American citizen, or any citizen, loses their job to an illegal immigrant, the rights of that American citizen have been violated. Equal protection under the law must include the consistent application of our immigration laws. These laws were passed to protect American citizens and lawful residents. For instance, federal law protects the ability of American workers to seek jobs and employment. When government suspends those immigration laws in order to curry favor with special interests  costing Americans their jobs  they have been denied the protection of their laws. In recent days, the media  as it usually does  has missed the whole point on immigration. All the media wants to talk about is the 11 million or more people here illegally. But my priority is the well-being of 300 million American citizens, including millions of Hispanic citizens and legal residents who want a secure border, a safe and drug-free community, and a growing economy. My goal is to provide good jobs, good schools, and safety to every Hispanic community in the country. But we cant do that if we dont secure our border. On Day One, I am going to begin swiftly removing criminal illegal immigrants from this country  including removing the hundreds of thousands of criminal illegal immigrants that have been released into U.S. communities under the Obama-Clinton Administration. These international gangs and cartels will be a thing of the past. Their reign of terror will be over. In this task, we will always err on the side of protecting the American people  we will use immigration law to prevent crimes, and will not wait until some innocent American has been harmed or killed before taking action. I am going to build a great border wall, institute nationwide e-verify, stop illegal immigrants from accessing welfare and entitlements, and develop an exit-entry tracking system to ensure those who overstay their visas are quickly removed. If we dont enforce visa expiration dates, then we have an open border  its as simple as that. I am also going to cancel all unconstitutional executive orders and empower rank-and-file ICE officers and Border Patrol officers to finally do the jobs they were hired for. Now, what is Hillary Clinton going to do? She has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, combined with the elimination of virtually all routine immigration enforcement. In other words, totally open borders. Which will lead to a massive crime wave. Most alarmingly, she has pledged to keep President Obamas executive amnesty  which has been blocked by the Supreme Court  directly disregarding a Supreme Court injunction. Beyond that, she has pledged to add another executive amnesty in violation of both Congressional law and the U.S. Constitution. These actions from Hillary Clinton will trigger one of the greatest Constitutional crisis in American history. In effect, she is pledging to abolish the law-making powers of Congress and assume the powers of an imperial ruler. This executive amnesty would bypass Congress to print millions of work permits and benefit cards to those ineligible to receive them. Hillary Clintons immigration proposal will also give illegal immigrants access to Obamacare, Social Security, Medicare and all U.S. welfare. Her plan will functionally end enforcement of visa overstays rules, another open border decree. She will also close down detention centers for border-crossers, meaning we will have an open southern border as well. This is not to mention that Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. She cant even say the words: Radical Islamic Terrorism. And she supports the Sanctuary City and catch-and-release policies that are getting innocent Americans killed. Ive met with many of these grieving families, including the incredible family of Sarah Root, a young Iowa girl who was killed by an illegal immigrant released from the border by the Obama Administration  and then released again after the killing. Ive been so inspired by the courage and bravery of the Root Family and Id like to invite them on the stage right now just to say a few words. Thank you. There is a reason why 16,500 Border Patrol agents have endorsed our campaign, and warned that Hillary Clintons plan is deeply dangerous divisive radical reckless wrecking innocent lives panders to extremists and would create unprecedented crisis So the choice couldnt be more clear. A vote for Trump is a vote to have a nation of laws, a vote for Clinton is a vote for open borders. On every issue, our campaign is about making life better for working people. But we cant accomplish that goal unless we break-up the special interest monopoly and give power back to the citizens. Many people have said that establishment media assault on me and our campaign  we have a movement  is the greatest in the political history of our country. Even today, some major papers fail to mention how strong our poll numbers have become over the short one-week period  they just refuse to print anything positive or good. They too are part of the rigged system trying to deny people the positive change they deserve. They take phrases and statements, chop them up, take them out of context, and discuss them for days. Always trying to demean and belittle me and our incredible movement to take our country back from the death spiral it is currently in. Imagine if this much media attention was spent telling the truth about the real problems facing America. Imagine if the media spent this much time telling the story of Sarah Root. All of the ugly things being said by Hillary Clinton in recent days  funded by big banks and Wall Street donors  are nothing more than a desperate attempt by failed leaders to cling to power in order to keep rigging the system. There is nothing they wont say or do, no lie they wont tell  and no amount of money they wont spend  to try to bully voters into giving them what they want. This November 8th, the American people are going to reject the cynicism of the past and embrace the optimism of the future. The old attacks arent going to work anymore. The Clinton-Kaine fear-mongering isnt going to resonate with anyone but the most radical factions of their far-left base. I want to empower people. Hillary Clinton wants to scare people. Empowering people begins with three simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs. Our economy will soar. Wages will rise. We will make new friends abroad, and achieve new peace at home. We will be a country of laws, and a country of great success. Our cities will be safe, sound and secure. Our government will be honest, ethical and responsive. Rule by special interests will be over. The rule of the American people will begin. So lets get out and vote on November 8th, and create the future our children deserve. Together, We Will Make America Strong Again. We Will Make American Wealthy Again. We Will Make America United Again. We Will Make America Safe Again. And We Will Make America Great Again  For Everyone.

11666,"Wendy Davis And Trapped Director Dawn Porter Talk Abortion, Television, And Daviss Political Future","There are people you expect to see all over SXSW: Andrew W.K., or Big Boi, or the cast of Silicon Valley. One of the people you might not expect to be a regular presence at the tech/film/music mega-conference, though, is former Texas State Senator Wendy Davis. But Davis is everywhere at SXSW this year. Shes been at screenings of Dawn Porters abortion law documentary Trapped; she spoke at the online harassment summit organized for Saturday; shes appearing on Monday at SXGood to announce a new project, Deeds Not Words; and shes going to speak at Tumblrs 79 Party on Wednesday evening, intended to celebrate womens voices. Thats a lot of SXSW appearances for anybody, let alone a former state senator whose last public move was a failed gubernatorial campaign. But Daviswho came to fame for her 2013 filibuster of the Texas abortion law, a story thats told (among others) in Trappedis readying her second act. Texas Monthly caught up with Davis and Porter to talk about abortion, her next moves, and what she says to women who want to take a picture with her. Texas Monthly: Whats the reaction been like to the film so far? Dawn Porter: The film premiered at Sundance, and the most surprising reaction from that audience was how emotional people are. One in three American women have an abortion, but theres so much shame and stigma that theres not an opportunity to speak about that experience. A number of people have said that after watching it, they felt like they werent alone. They were feeling a little bit of grief, but not regretting their decisions, and just that feeling of feeling supported by women. Here, its very interesting: People are so much more in tune to the law, so here people are not shocked by whats happening. I think what the audience here appreciates is seeing some of the people who are standing up for them. Out in the rest of the country, people are not aware of whats happening here with HB2, or really across the country. Here, theres a lot more like, Yeah, finally someones putting things together, and then tying it to the rest of the country. Texas Monthly: In addition to appearing with Trapped, theres a big Wendy Davis presence at SXSW this year: the movie, the panel on online harassment, the speech at SXGood, and youre appearing at Tumblrs party during SXSW Music, too. What do you have going on that makes having a big presence at SXSW worth doing? Wendy Davis: Im continuing to be a voice, as I can, for womennot just for reproductive autonomy and all that that signifies for womens ability to equalize opportunity in this world, but equal opportunity on a number of levels for women, which of course includes a myriad of issues that have yet to be addressed in the United States. Theres a lot of great work being done and Ive been proud to be a part of trying to advance to that. Texas Monthly: What other issues are you thinking about besides reproductive autonomy? Wendy Davis: Of course, equal pay. You may recall that I, along with the amazing Senfronia Thompson in the Texas House, was successful in passing an equal pay bill here, which was no easy featonly to have it vetoed by Governor Perry. So Texas is one of only a handful of states that does not have an equal pay law. Even the law that exists at the federal level needs some punch. We need a better mechanism for proactively addressing companies self-examining and bringing pay levels up, much like weve seen happen in Great Britain, for example, where companies are required to publicly report their pay scales. As a consequence of that, theyve done a lot of self-reflection and many didnt really realize the implicit bias in their pay structure, so things like that. Family leave, of course, very important. But for me, empowering girlsand I say girls purposefully, young girls from the very smallest of ages to not be socialized in ways that treat us to be other than the very equals that we are. Thats important and my work going forward is primarily going to be focused around young women on helping to move this incredibly passionate group of millennial women to some constructive action, because I get asked often by women who want to make a difference, How do I do it? What do I do? So were putting together an initiative thats going to help put some real concrete action steps in place for young women to take advantage of. Texas Monthly: The filibuster was in 2013, and things move fast in politics and in media, but you still clearly have a constituency among the people who came to recognize you then. When you do the Lenny Letter, people want to read what you say. When youre at SXSW, people want to come see you. Does it surprise you that you to still have this audience thats hungry to hear what you have to say? Do you see that as an opportunity, or a responsibility? Wendy Davis: I see it as both. All. All of the above. Its surprising to me, yes, and incredibly humbling and I feel so honored by it. Every now and then when someone asks to take a photo with me and they apologize for asking, I tell them I thought that the moment my gubernatorial campaign was behind me no one would want to take a photo with me again, so its an honor. I feel this incredible responsibility to young women and I see how hungry young women are for female role models in the world. I have been blessed with the opportunity to be one of those, and I take that responsibility very seriously and I want to make sure that I use that opportunity as productively as possible. Dawn Porter: We didnt interview Senator Davis for the film, really because as a style choice we wanted to stay in the moment and really use what she did on the floor at the Texas State Capitol as a starting-off point for the political conversation. So when the film was done and we knew we were coming to SXSW, we reached out to her and she immediately said yes, and has been incredibly generous with her time for some random documentary people who called up to say, Hey, can you come spend days with us? Her voice is so important and I think there is a hunger for people to have a voice. I think women in particular are feeling like we are being drowned out, and to have her here is incredibly important for us. Texas Monthly: This is a movie that is very unapologetically talking about abortion and abortion providers. Its very much on their side. During your campaign, the word abortion didnt come out a lot. It was language like womens health, and things like that. Im curious if youre more comfortable now just being involved with someone who really is very explicit is talking about abortion with a capital A. Wendy Davis: One of the most extraordinary things about not being in public office anymore is the freedom of no longer being constrained by message management. No matter whether I run for office, or have the ability to hold office again in the future, I will never allow myself to be message-managed again. I think its unbelievably important that we de-stigmatize abortion. We cant hide and pretend that thats not what were fighting for. That is a very important part of what were fighting foralong with a host of other reproductive rights. I feel a responsibility that I make sure to continue to speak up and out about that, and give other women the freedom to feel like they can do so as well. Because as Dawn said, one of the reasons that we are where we are on this issue is that these very real, human stories. The unbelievable devastation and the impact of laws like this arent necessarily known because its a topic that people feel is taboo, and they dont talk about it in their community conversations, and what Dawns done is really to help illuminate that. I hope it prompts a broader conversation that more of us feel comfortable talking openly and without any shame whatsoever about abortion and why its important to protect that constitutional right. Texas Monthly: When you opposed HB2, you and your colleagues made arguments about the purpose of the law that ultimately didnt affect anyones vote when it passed. When the Supreme Court heard arguments last week, justices like Kagan and Ginsburg made similar points, but this time, the people who support the law have to answer them. Whats it like for you, as someone who was saying those things almost three years ago, to see those arguments made in a way that has more consequence? Wendy Davis: It makes me so grateful for the fact that we have a three-branch system of government. Really that is what the courts are there for, to keep us in compliance with our constitutionally-held values. As a lawyer, it was very important to me, and I know for others on the Senate and the House floor during those debates, to make sure that we set the legal stage to empower this argument as strongly as possible. We knew that we werent going to change any minds in terms of the bills author and the supporters of the bill, but pinning them to the wall, forcing them to admit that they essentially had absolutely no objective, rational evidence that somehow supported the argument that these laws would make womens health better, it was important for us to build that record. Because we knew that day would come, and Im so grateful and thankful for the justice system and how it works, and the fact that we have had our day in court and that weve been able to really make those points in a very clear and profound way. Dawn Porter: Im actually a lawyer also and I cant underscore how critical that record is. I think what you have seen in the evolution in this argument and what you saw at the Supreme Court, is that the people challenging the law do not have to ask the Supreme Court to make new law. You can abide by the undue burden standard, because of the record that was created in the states. So saying, were not asking you to create a new legal standard, we are asking you to uphold the one that you have adhered to for the last several decades. Legally, this should be an easy case before the Supreme Court. Its whether or not the politics can actually overcome the law. I think were at a real tipping point in our culture of politics. Its going to be a really important test of our justice system. Texas Monthly: There are so many different groups of people who are fighting this battle: youve got documentarians, youve got doctors who are providing the abortions, youve got support staff who are running these facilities, youve got politicians who are fighting in state houses. How does all that come together? Dawn Porter: Eighty percent of Americans, if you ask them, believe that abortion should be legal and should be accessible. Theres a range of opinions on that, but the overwhelming majority of Americans believe in the right to an abortion. What I think is happening is a number of us are too silent about that, so part of the effort to use media is to say whatever you believe, use your voice. We all tell our toddlers, Use your words. This is a use your words momentif you are complacent, the loudest voices in the choir will win and those results will be devastating. This movie is certainly about abortion as an issue, and womens rights as an issue, and its also about our political system that would allow a small minority to dictate to the rest of us. I hope between brave lawyers, people willing to speak up, and people willing to tell their stories, that that will motivate others to be active. Texas Monthly: Youve got Wendy Davis here, whos obviously someone that people associate with this issue. When you make a movie like this and you get to introduce people to someone like Willie Parker, is that interesting to you? Dawn Porter: As a filmmaker youre attracted to people because you see something in them. What I love about my job so much is giving other people the opportunity to see what I saw. Doctor Parker was speaking and had somewhat of a public persona. Whats really thrilling is to see people that dont think of themselves as extraordinary and, I hope, helping them to see that the clinic owners, their work, is the living embodiment of our democratic system. Its I have rights because they are there. I know that certainly after these screenings, they have said they didnt see themselves that way and Im glad that now they do. Texas Monthly: Is it important to lend the stature that you have as the senator who filibustered the bill to help these people see themselves that way? Wendy Davis: What happened here in Texas was a profound and important day, and Ive had the opportunity to continue to speak up about reproductive rights, but what the folks who are highlighted in that movie are doing is the real workthe hard work of fighting day after day after day after day for adequate healthcare for the people that come to their clinics and to fight against the barrage of laws that try in every way possible to shut them down. Their dedication to human beings and the care and concern that they have for them is profound, and I was deeply touched watching the film last night to see the way that Dawn put an incredibly face on the work that they do and the value that they provide. They truly are the unsung heroes, and Im glad that theres a film out there that will help people to see that. Texas Monthly: Were at SXSW, which is music, film and entertainment, and I know you had some things in the works on television. Im curious, hows that going? Wendy Davis: Its kind of stalled for now. NBC did not move it forward to its upcoming pilot season, so the producer of the show and the writer of the show are shopping other networks right now. Texas Monthly: What was the process of developing that like for you? Wendy Davis: Interesting. I really enjoyed helping to write the script for the pilot, because it gave me an opportunity to give some light to a lot of these political issues that we deal with in Texas. I think thats whats so important about a show like that and why Im hopeful still that well find a home for it is because shining a light on the impact of some of the lawmaking thats occurring in places like Texas is really, really important. I think a lot of people in the public dont know whats happening and they dont understand how corrupting it is to our shared values. Texas Monthly: What specific role did you play in the writing? Did you have Final Draft open? Wendy Davis: I helped to create the storyline, is the best way to say it. After that, the writer would put together that story, give my perspective on whether it was being accurately portrayed, and some suggestions on how to make some changes to achieve that.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2016/may/27/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-wrongly-says-texas-among-states-no-equ/,Economy,Polifact

12186,North Carolina Becomes Ninth State with 10 Million Population,"By adding an average of 281 people per day during the last year, North Carolinas population crossed the 10 million mark, making the state the ninth in that category, according to U.S. Census Bureau state population estimates released today. North Carolinas population gain over the July 1, 2014, to July 1, 2015, period ranked it behind only Texas, Florida, California, Georgia and Washington. Notably, Florida added more people than California for the first time in nearly a decade. Floridas gain of 365,703 people also pushed it past 20 million, becoming the third state to reach that milestone. California continued to be the most populous state on July 1, 2015, with 39.1 million, followed by Texas with 27.5 million. North Dakota was the nations fastest-growing state or equivalent over the last year, for the fourth year in a row. Its population increased 2.3 percent, followed by 1.9 percent growth in Colorado, the District of Columbia and Nevada. Each of the 10 fastest-growing states was in the South or West with the exception of North Dakota. Seven states lost population between July 1, 2014, and July 1, 2015: Illinois (22,194 or -0.17 percent), West Virginia (4,623 or -0.25 percent), Connecticut (3,876 or -0.11 percent), Mississippi (1,110 or -0.04 percent), Maine (928 or -0.07 percent), Vermont (725 or -0.12 percent) and New Mexico (458 or -0.02 percent). The United States as a whole saw its population increase by 0.79 percent over the period to 321.4 million, slightly faster than the rate of growth over the previous one-year period (0.78 percent). In addition to the 50 states and the District of Columbia, the new statistics also include estimates for Puerto Rico. On July 1, 2015, Puerto Rico had an estimated population of 3.5 million, a decline of 60,706, or 1.7 percent, from one year earlier. The Census Bureau produces population estimates each year, allowing the public to gauge the growth and demographic composition of the nation, states and communities. These statistics use administrative data to estimate population change between census years, using the decennial census count as a starting point. Local governments use estimates to locate services, and the private sector uses them to locate businesses. The Census Bureau also released today estimates of the number of people 18 and older in the U.S., states and Puerto Rico. The downloadable file also includes total population and the percentage of people 18 and older. In 2015, there were 247.8 million voting-age residents in the U.S., comprising 77.1 percent of the nations population. Internet address: www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/data-sets.html. During 2016, the Census Bureau will release estimates of the 2015 population of counties, cities and towns, and metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas as well as national, state and county population estimates by age, sex, race and Hispanic origin.

But Kenney is not backing down. Its not a grocery tax, number one, which is very misleading to people, Kenney says. The mayor says everyone is entitled to their opinion, but he would like opponents to stick to facts. He pulled out a few of his own that he thinks work in his favor. We have a 26 percent poverty rate, we have children not getting education, we have facilities that are falling down, Kenney says. And big soda has a lot of money, they make a lot of profit off their product and they market in neighborhoods that suffer from these very things that were trying to cure.

13203,One step up and two steps back,"With the release of the  triennial Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) from the Federal Reserve, it is once again time to look at trends in wealth. The SCF is one of the best sources for data on net worth (assets minus liabilities) in the U.S. In this post I use the newly released 2013 data to update my previous posts that looked at wealth trends using the 2007 and 2010 SCFs. The figure below reports changes in wealth for two periods. First, the purple bars are a repeat of the post on the 2010 SCF which reported changes in wealth from 2007-10. That period happened to coincide with the Great Recession. So, the first purple bar reflects the effects of the bursting of the housing bubble and financial debacle followed by the Great Recession, which caused typical families to lose about two-fifths of their total wealth. The middle purple bar reports the change in cumulative wealth of those on the Forbes 400 list. Forbes estimates the net worth of the 400 wealthiest Americans, and it turns out these folks  heavily invested in the stock market, real estate and myriad other financial assets  also lost ground during the recession (-16%). Finally, the third purple bar breaks out the Walton 6 listed on the Forbes 400. They fared pretty well over the Great Recession as their wealth was up 22% from 2007-10. At the time the companys then-CFO rightly stated that tough times are actually a good time for Wal-Mart. I turn now to the green bars in the figure. These represent just-released 2013 data and reflect changes in wealth from 2010-13. Unfortunately, even as the recession is officially far behind us (it ended in June 2009); the benefits of economic growth have yet to reach typical families as they lost another 2% of wealth over this period. Typical family wealth in 2013 was $81,200  which is about the same as it was in 1992 at $80,200 (all figures in this post are in 2013 dollars). But things are really looking up for the wealthiest among us, as those on the Forbes 400 saw a 45% rebound in their wealth during 2010-13 and the subset of Walton wealth increased by just over half (51%). The cumulative wealth of the Forbes 400 was about $2.1 trillion, or roughly the same as that held by the entire bottom 60% of American families. The combined worth of the Walton 6 was $145 billion in 2013  which equaled the total wealth of the entire bottom 43%. On this side of the Great Recession, after much discussion of inequality, it looks like it is going to be more of the same  typical workers and their families, who paid the price during the downturn, have gained little during the upturn.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2016/mar/14/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-says-walmart-heirs-are-wealthier-bo/,Economy,Polifact
13352,"Transcript of the Democratic Presidential Debate in Flint, Mich."," In 1963, and an important day for me, I went to the march on Washington led by Dr. King for jobs and freedom. Dr. King has been an important inspiration for me. In this campaign, if you go toberniesanders.com and read our position on criminal justice, it is I believe the strongest position of any candidate. What it says among other things, 51 percent of African-American kids today are unemployed  you know were going to do? Were going to provide education and jobs for those kids, not jails or incarceration. COOPER: In a speech about policing, the FBI director borrowed a phrase from Avenue Q saying, everybody is a little racist. So on a personal front, what racial blind spots do you have? CLINTON: Let me go answer Mr. Mcghees question because I think its a profound one. I think the most important that happened to me was a combination of my church and youth minister when I was a teenager, insisting that we go in to inner-city Chicago because I lived in a suburb and have exchanges with kids in black and hispanic churches. It was also important for me to be a baby-sitter for the children of migrant workers and to learn more about their lives, and to hear Dr. King speak in Chicago when I was about 14 years old. That got me thinking about what I needed to do to try to fulfill my faith. When I was in law school, I had the opportunity to mead a visionary woman, named Mary Right Adelman, who worked with Dr. King who was the first African-American woman who passed the Mississippi bar. I asked her for a job and she said she didnt have any money. I was working my way through law school and she said if I could get a job and get myself paid, she would give me a job. So I got law students a Civil Rights Research Council Grant. The first thing she did was send me to look at South Carolina, to investigate juveniles being sent to adult jails. The second thing she did was to send me to Alabama to investigate segregated academies. So from that moment until today, I am so grateful for my experiences as a very young woman driven by my church and my experiences working for the Childrens Defense Fund which have given me some insight and have lit a fire inside me to do everything I can to address systemic racism. LEMON: I want to ask both of you this question. I appreciate you responding to that question, but I want to ask both of you again. In a speech about policing, the FBI director James Comey borrowed a phrase saying, everyone is a little bit racist. What racial blind spot do you have? Secretary, you first.CLINTON: Well, Don, if I could, I think being a white person in the United States of America, I know that I have never had the experience that so many people, the people in this audience have had. And I think its incumbent upon me and what I have been trying to talk about during this campaign is to urge white people to think about what it is like to have the talk with your kids, scared that your sons or daughters, even, could get in trouble for no good reason whatsoever like Sandra Bland and end up dead in a jail in Texas.  CLINTON: And I have spent a lot of time with the mothers of African-American children who have lost them, Trayvon Martins mother. And Ive gotten to know them. Ive listened to them. And it has been incredibly humbling because I cant pretend to have the experience that you have had and others have had. But I will do everything that I possibly can to not only do the best to understand and to empathize, but to tear down the barriers of systemic racism that are in the criminal justice system, in the employment system, in the education and health care system. That is what I will try to do to deal with what I know is the racism that still stalks our country.

13897,Raimondo details Rhode Island's pitch to GE,"Began with 7 a.m. phone call, included private dinner at Bacaro  before company opted for Boston PROVIDENCE, R.I.  Governor Raimondo offered details Tuesday about how Rhode Island worked its way onto General Electric's radar as the company sought a new headquarters, how she traveled to Fairfield, Conn., last July for a meeting and then how the Ocean State stayed in the running with an economic incentives package ""over $100 million,"" which was ""competitive"" with the $145 million in subsidies the company ultimately got to move to Boston. The state offered Rebuild Rhode Island and Qualified Jobs Incentive tax credits and a tax-increment financing district, Raimondo said. But she offered no details about the source of that much money. It's difficult to say exactly how much is available from current state incentives. GE whittled its list from 30 locations to Boston, New York City and Providence, Raimondo said. Now, she remains ""very much in talks with them"" about possibly bringing back-office or information-technology jobs here, or, ""It could be an innovation center."" During a meeting with a group of reporters, Raimondo released what she said was her first presentation to GE. The governor stressed ongoing state efforts to create a more predictable tax and business climate, skilled workers from Brown University's data science and computer science programs and the Rhode Island School of Design, pension reform, plus the state's optimal location between Boston and New York, good quality of life and lower cost-of-living. Raimondo's pitch began with a 7 a.m. Saturday phone call to a member of General Electric's board of directors, Douglas Alexander Warner III, with whom Raimondo serves on the Yale Corporation, her law school's governing board: ""I said, 'Hey, I want to put my hat in the ring. We've got a lot going on.' "" That led to a call with Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey S. Bornstein, then Chairman and CEO Jeffrey R. Immelt: ""And I said, 'Just let us compete.' "" At first, GE executives questioned, ""Rhode Island?!"" Raimondo said. Yet they knew of the state's pension-reform efforts, which she led as state treasurer. The state's pitch included a private dinner with GE executives at the Italian restaurant Bacaro on South Water Street. They met when the restaurant was closed to keep the talks quiet. Guests included Hasbro CEO Brian Goldner, two to three other CEOs, presidents of the University of Rhode Island, Brown and RISD, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed and Providence Mayor Jorge O. Elorza, who ""stopped by."" When she took the call that the company wanted a bigger city, Raimondo said she was ""disappointed."" But overall, ""I was thrilled. When we started this ...

14908,Boehner: House Republicans for responsible energy,"American energy policy needs to be more responsive and less onerous A gas pipeline riser on private property in Reno, Texas. (Photo: Michael Mulvey for USA TODAY) One thing I learned running a small business is that you have to play to your strengths. Our economy has its challenges, but America is at the forefront of an energy boom. We have more combined oil, coal and natural gas resources than any other nation on Earth. That's why, every day, Republicans are working on a true all-of-the-above energy agenda that will help lower costs, create jobs, strengthen our allies and make us a nation of builders again. Such a strategy has the potential to usher in a new era of American leadership and prosperity  but we can't do it alone. President Obama says he supports all of the above, but his actions prove the opposite. Just consider his plan to impose excessive new EPA regulations on power plants  what amounts to a national energy tax. It will have Americans asking, ""Where are the jobs?"" for years while their bills go up, electric grid reliability is compromised, and energy-intensive sectors like manufacturing take on even more water. The president is so out of touch that he won't even approve the popular Keystone XL pipeline. As for his party's leaders in the Senate, they also talk a big game about energy only to block our most common-sense solutions. Here are some examples: The House has acted to prevent duplicative federal regulations on hydraulic fracturing, which has lowered unemployment in states that have safely and effectively regulated this type of energy production. And we have pressed the president to open more areas to exploration and production, and cut back red tape on new energy projects. We'll continue that effort this summer with legislation to reduce permitting delays for new factories  making it easier to plan, invest and revitalize manufacturing. America has the resources to become an energy superpower, but we need the right infrastructure in place to get there. Thanks to technological advancements, natural gas production on state and private lands is up 33% and oil is up 61% since 2009. That energy boom, however, is being throttled by a pipeline system that has not kept pace with our changing energy landscape. The House has voted to expedite the approval of new pipelines, and will soon advance additional legislation to create a more efficient process for cross-border pipeline approvals and prevent another debacle like we've seen with the Keystone pipeline. The nearly six-year delay in approving Keystone is costing Americans more than 100,000 jobs and nearly a million barrels of oil a day, and forcing our most important trading partner to look to China for new energy markets. The House passed a bill last year that would green-light the project immediately, creating jobs and reducing our dependence on unstable energy sources. But the president and Senate Democrats remain opposed. Advancing our energy independence is imperative for our economic and national security, and for that of our allies. Just last week, Russia announced it was cutting off natural gas exports to Ukraine, which is also the transit route for 15% of Europe's natural gas. The House has voted to give the president the tools he needs to counter Vladimir Putin's aggression, but we must do more to break Russia's energy stranglehold on Europe. With a backlog of 26 liquefied natural gas export applications pending, the House will act where the administration has not and move a bill to expedite the approval of more LNG exports. Doing so will not only strengthen our international partners, it will help create jobs and promote energy production here at home. In addition to all this, we've also passed legislation to prevent that national energy tax from taking effect without congressional approval, while advancing several other bills aimed at stopping regulations targeting coal-fired electricity. And because a true all-of-the-above policy requires us not only to harness the resources we have, but to use them wisely, we have passed bipartisan, common-sense legislation to promote increased energy efficiency. The president has no more elections to win, yet he allows the narrow interests of his most extreme political allies to dictate an agenda that puts jobs and opportunity out of reach for middle-class families. While he's writing America's energy workers off, we're trying to give them the tools they need to succeed. That's how we play to our strengths, and that's how America can win against significant global competition. Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, is speaker of the house.

17640,"Inequality, exhibit A: Walmart and the wealth of American families","Two weeks ago saw the 50th anniversary of the opening of the first Walmart. And just a week before that, the Federal Reserve released the underlying data on family wealth from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). The SCF is the survey that reported the median wealth of American families (that is, the wealth of that American family that is exactly wealthier than half of all families and less wealthy than half) fell by 38.8 percent between 2007 and 2010. We have argued previously that Walmart is a useful archetype for trends in the larger American economy over the past three decades. Its enormous size and bargaining power has led to fabulous wealth for its owners (most notably the Walton family), while the compensation it pays its employees is generally low, even by retail standards; and the ubiquity of Walmart stores means that it is effectively the marginal employer in many U.S. counties. And its role as this marginal employer often serves to drive down workers wages county-wide. The three years of wealth data from 2007 to 2010 just provides an extreme example of how the economic fortunes of Walmarts owners have diverged from those of typical American households. Concretely, between 2007 and 2010, while median family wealth fell by 38.8 percent, the wealth of the Walton family members rose from $73.3 billion to $89.5 billion (note that the 2007 wealth number is slightly larger than was reported at the timeto provide an inflation-adjusted comparison, I converted the 2007 wealth value of $69.7 billion to 2010 dollars using the consumer price index (the CPI-U-RS, to be specific)). In 2007, it was reported that the Walton family wealth was as large as the bottom 35 million families in the wealth distribution combined, or 30.5 percent of all American families. And in 2010, as the Waltons wealth has risen and most other Americans wealth declined, it is now the case that the Walton family wealth is as large as the bottom 48.8 million families in the wealth distribution (constituting 41.5 percent of all American families) combined. Its hardly a surprise that the economic circumstances of the Walton family and that of most Americans are moving in opposite directions, but some have attempted to quibble with the use of this particular statistic by noting that nearly 13 million American families have negative net worthmeaning that they have outstanding debts greater than the value of their assets. This is a bit of a strange objectionof course, many American families have negative net worth, but this is an economic reality, not a statistical fluke. Its true that some of these negative net worth families are not necessarily families that are economically struggling: take a 27-year-old recent graduate of Harvard Medical School who has enormous student loan debt, but also has 40 or 50 or 60 years of very high earnings potential in front of them. However, its probably a safe guess that negative net-worth families that are actually very well-placed economically are a rare exception, and not the rule. And increasingly, many of these negative net-worth families are people who find themselves underwater in the wake of the housing bubbles burstas can be inferred in the large increase in the share of families reporting negative net worth between 2007 and 2010 (negative net-worth families rose from roughly 7.7 percent of the total in 2011 to 11 percent in 2011). But still, these critics charge, the Walton wealth comparison is unfair because the negative net-worth families distort the whole calculation. Anyone with positive net worth, even $1, they point out, has more wealth than millions of American families. Lets take these critics suggestion and remove all the negative values at the bottom of the distribution, extinguishing the value of their debts that exceed their assets and assigning them a zero net worth instead. What does the comparison look like then? Not that different: After making this adjustment, about 15.4 million families (13.1 percent of the population) have zero net worth, no small number to be sure. But the Walmart heirs $89.5 billion is still equal to the combined net worth of the bottom 33.2 million families (about 28.2 percent of the total), even after extinguishing all negative net worth values in the SCF. Again, it should be noted that this modification of the SCF is just not an economically sound thing to do; the negative net-worth observations in the SCF data represent economic information (let alone the realities of millions of families) that cannot just be discarded because people think that the number of families that need to have their wealth added together to sum to the Walton familys total is arbitrarily too high in some way. To address these points in one last way, take the wealth of the Walton family ($89.5 billion) compared to the wealth of the median American familythat family that is wealthier than half of all others and less wealthy than half. In 2010, median wealth was $77,300 (down from $126,400 in 2007). How many of these typical American households (i.e., those with median wealthwealthier than fully half of the overall population) would you need to lump together to reach the Walton familys wealth? About 1.16 million, up from 580,000 in 2007. In short, it would still take a citys worth of families with the overall median wealth to match the Walton familys net worth. The figure below shows just how many families with median wealth would need to be combined to equal the Walton familys wealth, and how this has changed over time.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/dec/08/one-wisconsin-now/just-how-wealthy-wal-mart-walton-family/,Economy,Polifact
17711,Testimony before the Rhode Island Special Joint Legislative Commission to Study the Sales Tax Repeal,"Download Testimony before the Rhode Island Special Joint Legislative Commission to Study the Sales Tax Repeal Testimony before the Rhode Island Special Joint Legislative Commission to Study the Sales Tax Repeal November 21, 2013 Joseph Henchman Vice President for Legal & State Projects, Tax Foundation Mr. Chairman, Members of the Commission: Good afternoon. It is an honor and a pleasure for me to be in front of you today. For many years now, I've had the chance to come to Rhode Island to discuss tax policy with elected officials and Mr. Simmons has invited me up many times to speak at his events. Visiting the Ocean State is something I always truly look forward to. We at the Tax Foundation get a lot of mail and e-mail with crazy tax ideas. It's the nature of the business, I suppose. People convinced the Sixteenth Amendment was never ratified. People who have come up with their own new all-encompassing tax idea. Not a week goes by without something like that coming across our desk. Depending on who it is, we try to be polite and explain whatever needs to be explained. A state doing without a sales tax is not crazy. As you know, of course, there are five states that do without a state sales tax. Before eighty years ago, no state had a sales tax. They came about not as a well-thought-out, well-designed tax but as a crash implementation in the midst of crisisthe Great Depression. In fact, if you got the nation's public finance and state tax experts in a room, and asked them to design a sales tax, it would look very different from the sales tax that many states, including Rhode Island, have today. What 9 out of 10 public finance experts would say is that the sales tax should apply to all final sales of goods and services, while exempting all business inputs. That way, the tax is neutral, does not distort economic decisions, and keeps pace with the economy. Many state sales taxesincluding Rhode Islanddo the opposite. Many goods and nearly all services are exempt from tax, while business purchases are taxed. The result is that some items are taxed multiple times and others not at all. I think you all already know that Rhode Island's sales tax rate is high, both nationally and compared to its neighbors. But you may not know that Rhode Island's sales tax basewhat is and is not taxedis among the narrowest in the country. Only 25 percent of what people buy is subject to Rhode Islands sales tax. Only Illinois, Massachusetts, and New Jersey have narrower sales taxes. You are exempting 75 percent of the economy from the sales tax already and imposing a high rate on the rest that you do tax. I would say that this means reform of some kind is needed. We've spoken in the past on various reform measuresGovernor Chaffee's sales tax broadening plan right after he took office, Governor Carcieri's income tax changes, and so forth. I will be perfectly honest with you, when I first heard of the zero sales tax idea for Rhode Island, my first reaction wasnice idea but how can it possibly happen? Again, and you don't need me tell you this, Rhode Island depends on the sales tax for about 30 percent of its tax revenuea lower dependence than the average state but still a big number. Almost $900 million. So if you'll indulge me, there are three points I want to share as I thought about this idea and whether it should happen and, if so, how it can happen. First, no fiscal expertnot onewould tell you that a sales tax repeal would mean a 100 percent revenue loss of all $887 million. Taxes affect behavior, and that's as true of the sales tax as any other tax. Delaware has no sales tax and on the border with New Jerseywhich has the same sales tax rate as Rhode Islandthere are a bunch of retail stores that do a brisk business. I was just in Portland, Oregon, another state with no sales tax, and it has about the most vibrant independent retailer market in the country for a big city. People will drive out of their way to avoid that 7 percent. Those added sales will mean added business activity, added jobs, and added income and business tax payments to the state. So called ""static"" revenue estimates are easy to do but get more and more wrong the bigger the tax change. For a tax change like this, you have to know there will be strong dynamic effects. Where we start disagreeing is how much will come back of that $887 million. I know you have been hearing from the STAMP people, and the REMI people, and of course Mr. Dion and the DOR, and probably some others. They probably all agree that repealing the sales tax will lose more than $0 and less than $887 million, will create jobs of some positive net number, and will lead to increased business activity of some amount. All of these modelers have a reputation for being conscientious about doing their best to try and get as close as possible. It is, however, difficult to model the decisions of a million people in Rhode Island, and millions more in surrounding states, and estimate how their behavior will change with a bold tax change. Think about their results carefully, but I would agree there would be a revenue loss involved of much less than $887 million. Second, a spurious argument you should be aware of is the three legged stool argument. Now there are plenty of decent and sensible reasons to oppose a sales tax repeal or reduction but this is not one of them. The argument goes something like you need every major tax because that way you have a diversity of revenue options. Much like a stool needs three strong equal legs, a state revenue system needs three separate revenue sources. There is no academic evidence supporting this urban legend. In fact, the state with the most stable revenue over the last ten years was South Dakota: a state that doesnt even have corporate and individual income taxes, and gets nearly half its revenue from the sales tax. One of the most volatile was California: a state that has every major tax. Believe meits my home stateif theres a tax out there, California's got it. In reality, if you want a stable tax systemstable for government and for taxpayerswhat matters is that you have a well-structured tax system with broad bases and low rates. Having three revenue sources achieves nothing if each of them is badly designed, with high rates and narrow bases as in California. There's no magic number of taxes, whether it be 2, 3, or 120. What matters is that the taxes you do have be well-structured. Third, I cannot understate how intense the interstate competition for jobs and investment and people is becoming now. I chat with governors, economic development officers, site relocation experts, businesses big and small, and they are constantly looking at their options. Instantaneous communication and near-instantaneous transportation for people and goods means that, increasingly, people can live and work just about anywhere. And that means states increasingly need to be thinking aboutand if I leave you with one thought, it's thiswhy my state? Why should a business entrepreneur, a college graduate, or a venture capitalist pick here out of all the places in the world. Now I work at the Tax Foundation, but I freely admit taxes are not the only factor that go into these decisions. State services matter. Housing prices matter. Where you were born matters. Even the restaurant scene matters. New York has an awful tax system but they have the legacy of when they had a good tax systemWall Street and skyscrapers filled with corporate officersand you can buy a hot sandwich at 3:00 in the morning. The difficulty confronting Rhode Island is do you keep the awful tax systemone near the bottom of every national rankingand ""make it up"" with something else, or do you try do something bold to stand out and make the tax system better? We ran the sales tax repeal proposal through our State Business Tax Climate Index, where Rhode Island currently ranks 46th out of the 50 states, with a more business friendly tax system than only Minnesota, California, New Jersey, and New York. With no sales tax, Rhode Island would have rocketed up to 31st, a significant improvement. If reform were coupled with some reform of the corporate income taxtaking away some targeted tax credits and lowering the very high rateRhode Island could move into the top half of states on taxes. It can happen. Something bold is needed. New Hampshire and Montana, in particular, are two states with about the same population size as Rhode Island, and without any of the resource or business location miracles that allow Alaska or Delaware to go without a sales tax. I have a handout on these differences but that is how I would characterize this proposal: bold, difficult, but feasible.

21101,"With Stickers, a Petition and Even a Middle Name, Secession Fever Hits Texas","The official in East Texas, Peter Morrison, the treasurer of the Hardin County Republican Party, said in a statement that he had received overwhelming support from conservative Texans and overwhelming opposition from liberals outside the state in response to his comments in his newsletter. He said that it may take time for people to appreciate that the fundamental cultural differences between Texas and other parts of the United States may be best addressed by an amicable divorce, a peaceful separation. Photo The online petitions  created on the We the People platform at petitions.whitehouse.gov  are required to receive 25,000 signatures in 30 days for the White House to respond. The Texas petition, created Nov. 9 by a man identified as Micah H. of Arlington, had received more than 116,000 signatures by Friday. It asks the Obama administration to peacefully grant the withdrawal of Texas, and describes doing so as practically feasible, given the states large economy. Residents in other states, including Alabama, Florida, Colorado, Louisiana and Oklahoma, have submitted similar petitions, though none have received as many signatures as the one from Texas. A White House official said every petition that crossed the signature threshold would be reviewed and would receive a response, though it was unclear precisely when Micah H. would receive his answer.

View all New York Times newsletters. Gov. Rick Perry, who twice made public remarks in 2009 suggesting that he was sympathetic to the secessionist cause, will not be signing the petition. Governor Perry believes in the greatness of our union, and nothing should be done to change it, a spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, said in a statement. But he also shares the frustrations many Americans have with our federal government. The secession movement in Texas is divergent, with differences in goals and tactics. One group, the Republic of Texas, says that secession is unnecessary because, it claims, Texas is an independent nation that was illegally annexed by the United States in 1845. (The groups leader and other followers waged a weeklong standoff with the Texas Rangers in 1997 that left one of its members dead.) Mr. Kilgore, the candidate who is changing his middle name, said he had not signed the White House petition because he did not believe that Texans needed to ask Washington for permission to leave. Our economy is about 30 percent larger than that of Australia, said Mr. Kilgore, 48, a telecommunications contractor. Australia can survive on their own, and I dont think well have any problem at all surviving on our own in Texas. Few of the public calls for secession have addressed the messy details, like what would happen to the states many federal courthouses, prisons, military bases and parklands. No one has said what would become of Kevin Patteson, the director of the states Office of State-Federal Relations, and no one has asked the Texas residents who received tens of millions of dollars in federal aid after destructive wildfires last year for their thoughts on the subject. But all the secession talk has intrigued liberals as well. Caleb M. of Austin started his own petition on the White House Web site. He asked the federal government to allow Austin to withdraw from Texas and remain part of the United States, in the event that Texas is successful in the current bid to secede. It had more than 8,000 signatures as of Friday.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2012/dec/20/larry-kilgore/larry-kilgore-says-texas-economy-about-30-percent-/,Economy,Polifact
21105,"ICYMI: Scott Walker's WEDC Faces ""Serious"" Problems","ICYMI: Scott Walker's WEDC Faces ""Serious"" Problems In typically secretive fashion, Scott Walker late Friday afternoon dumped the bad news that his troubled Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, which lost track of $56 million in taxpayer funds and has become a symbol of Walker's job-creation failures, faces serious problems, according to an internal memo. Scott Walkers unaccountable WEDC has faced problems since its sloppy inception. In September 2012, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development suspended the states Community Development Block Grant program, citing WEDCs ineligibility to administer such funds as they were not an instrumentality of the state. As recently as October, Scott Walker stated that, I want to make it clear that overwhelmingly the staff of the WEDC is doing a good job. The quasi-private agency, which is not legally bound to report their financial records and whose employees are not subject to state ethics laws, has also come under fire for a suspected bid-rigging scheme, its failure to recognize education and worker training as essential building blocks in economic development, and for its failure to create and attract family-sustaining jobs in Wisconsin. The internal memo cites WEDCs single-minded focus to drive job creation through new initiatives as the reason for any missteps that have been made. However, under Scott Walker, Wisconsin has been among the worst states for job creation and has the under-performed the rest of the Midwest, leading one in five Wisconsin business owners to say they foresee layoffs in the coming year. Scott Walkers WEDC was supposed to help create 250,000 new jobs and be the symbol of his first term in office, Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Mike Tate said Monday. Well, it HAS become emblematic of Scott Walker deception and mismanagement. WEDC has lost $56 million in taxpayer funds and is dogged with rumors of bid-rigging, has a board full of Walkers campaign donors, and is led by a career Walker campaign operative with zero business experience. Scott Walker has even removed the 250,000 jobs promise from his website. It sounds like WEDC is going to symbolize perfectly Walker's time in office.

21118,Job growth improves in 20 states,"More state labor markets are pulling out of the economic slump created by the recession. As recently as March of this year, only two states (North Dakota and Alaska) were adding nonfarm jobs year-over-year. By May, the number of states posting year-to-year growth had improved to an even dozen. Now, based on June nonfarm employment figures from the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, jobs in the past 12 months are up in an expanded total of 20 states. These gains dont mean that job creation is on the verge of a boom, but the percentage decrease of 0.05 percent for the nation was the smallest recorded in two years of monthly year-over-year job losses. By Lee McPheters _EMAIL_ P. Carey (Note: Complete current and historical rankings and data on year-over-year non-agricultural employment changes for states and metro areas are available at the newly-expanded Job Growth Update, published by the W. P. Carey School, including extensive detail on employment by industry.) More state labor markets are pulling out of the economic slump created by the recession. As recently as March of this year, only two states (North Dakota and Alaska) were adding nonfarm jobs year-over-year. By May, the number of states posting year-to-year growth had improved to an even dozen. Now, based on June nonfarm employment figures from the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, jobs in the past 12 months are up in an expanded total of twenty states. These gains dont mean that job creation is on the verge of a boom. Employment in 30 states and the nation-as-a-whole declined over-the-year once again in June. But the percentage decrease of 0.05 percent for the nation was the smallest recorded in two years of monthly year-over-year job losses. Percentage gains are still small The largest employment percentage increase for the past 12 months was posted by New Hampshire (1.46%). Other states with gains exceeding one percent included Kentucky, Alaska, Indiana, and Utah (see table). While increases of one percent may seem small, the positive growth for states in June is far better than just a few months ago, when every state lost jobs year-over-year in December of 2009. In New Hampshire, the percentage gains were paced by strong increases in services both to businesses and consumers. Employment was up by more than 19 percent as the category administrative and support and waste management and remediation services within the business services industry added 5,000 new jobs. Food services including restaurants grew by 4,100 jobs over June of last year.

Health care was the single largest growth category, with more than 45,000 jobs. Federal and local governments each grew by more than 20,000 workers, and Texas oil and gas related employment was up by 15,100 in June. No state has reported consistent growth across all industries so far in the current recovery. In Michigan, for example, manufacturing employment surged by 27,200 new jobs, but construction and finance were both down by more than 8,000 jobs over-the-year in June. Still, Michigans reversal to positive over-the-year job growth was the first since the spring of 2005. And, importantly, the June manufacturing increase was the second consecutive gain, after an unbroken string of 128 monthly over-the-year decreases extending back a full decade, to the summer of 2000. The Bottom Ten States from the West and the South accounted for nine of the bottom ten states ranked by year-over-year percentage employment change in June. Nevadas employment decline of 2.3 percent placed the state in 50th position for the 19th consecutive month, starting in December of 2008. The sole Northeastern state in the bottom ten, Rhode Island was in 49th place for the third month. Western states among the very weakest labor markets included New Mexico (48th), California (47th), Colorado (46th) and Oregon (44th). California, the nations largest state, lost the greatest number of jobs (213,400) of any state in the past 12 months.

21139,Point Person: Our Q&A with Rob Portman on the GOP's take,"The 2012 presidential election was billed variously as the most important of a generation, our lifetime or anyones lifetime. In truth, we had an election four years ago, and well have another in four years. Every presidential choice, in its own way, is pivotal to our nations history and certainly for the coming years for many reasons  not the least of which what it means for the two dominant political parties. In this case, the Democrats are triumphant and the Republicans despondent. Points asked one notable leader of each side, Democrat Bill Richardson and Republican Rob Portman, how they evaluate President Barack Obamas re-election and what it means for their party going forward. Richardson was governor of New Mexico from 2003 to 2011, served previously in Congress and was U.N. ambassador and energy secretary under President Bill Clinton. GOP Rep. Portman of Ohio helped Mitt Romney prepare for the presidential debates by playing the role of Obama. So what happened? It was a very close race here in Ohio and around the country, but ultimately, Governor Romney came up short. We are divided as a country and that showed in the close House, Senate and presidential results. I do think most voters are fiscally conservative and agree Washington must control spending, but we could have done a better job explaining why we had the better plan. Same with other issues, including the economy. Most people agree the Obama administrations policies have failed to create the jobs America needs. But my sense is they needed more information on how our plans would impact them and their families. What is it that Republicans need to do to recapture the White House? This was the second consecutive presidential race in which the GOP has come up short. Pretty much everywhere you turn, you see headlines about the GOP at a crossroads. It was a wake-up call for us. We need to reach beyond our base without sacrificing our core values, and it can be done. There is a common-sense conservative majority in swing states like Ohio, but its a more diverse group than the GOP base. What about minority voters? Newt Gingrich said after the election that the GOP faces an institutional challenge in facing up to the nations changing demographics, especially with Latinos. And others, like Jeb Bush, have been promoting a broader base for a good while. To get less than 30 percent of the Hispanic vote and less than 8 percent of the African-American vote shows the potential we have to reach out with an inclusive message of fiscal conservatism, pro-growth policies to help small business and a renewed emphasis on the opportunity society. You played President Obama in debate preparations for Mitt Romney, so you have some insight into his thinking and that of his party. You also took the role of Barack Obama in prepping John McCain for his debates with his challenger. What do you think is allowing Democrats to win? Is it values, ground-game, something else? I really believe we had the better argument on policy. Most people acknowledge the need to deal with the debt and deficit and focus on job creation through the private sector, not government. They understand we need to reform our economy to make it more competitive through improving and modernizing our tax, regulatory, worker training, energy and trade policies. Those were our policies. We had the change mantle and it was a change election. But we were not as effective on communications and were outspent until the very end. And, they had a better turnout operation and have more effectively used social media and technology to communicate with and motivate their voters and, ultimately, get them to the polls. Americans communicate in ways not thought of a decade ago. They get their news from sources not in existence two decades ago, and our tactics must adapt to the changing environment. Moving ahead, what needs to happen to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff? As you know, at the years end the nations looking at a double hit of automatic tax hikes and spending cuts. Economists are worried this could sharply curtail growth of the gross domestic product and spike unemployment. The American economy has for too long been gripped by uncertainty  about taxes, regulation, debt and now an $800 billion fiscal cliff. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has just told us that these massive tax increases and defense cuts, and other aspects of so-called sequestration, will take us into a recession and kill jobs. So, first, we must ensure that Americas families and job creators do not see their income taxes rise in January. Instead, we should continue the current tax rates and tax code for six months to a year, during which time Congress would be required to pass pro-growth tax reform that simplifies the complicated tax code, lowers rates, and generates more revenue through economic growth. Congress should also work to ensure that the drastic sequestration cuts to defense  which both parties agree will be devastating to national security  will not happen. But that doesnt mean Congress should ignore the deficit. Washington should adopt short-term spending cuts equivalent to the savings under sequestration from other parts of the nations budget on both the so-called mandatory and discretionary side to take us through the next six months or year, coinciding with tax reform. While averting the fiscal cliff, next year, which is a non-election year, Washington must finally reform our inefficient tax code to generate more growth and jobs, reform our important but unsustainable entitlement programs and curb the runaway spending that has pushed federal spending to its highest levels ever. Spending annually is now a staggering $30,000 per household and the accumulated debt is now $50,000 for every person in America. It is past time for Congress to confront head-on this immoral debt burden being left to future generations. What are the problems that you think the two parties can realistically solve? We hear a lot of good intentions now, but what are we likely to see in another six months or so? It is time for Congress to break through the partisan gridlock and address a whole range of issues, as outlined above. One issue ripe for bipartisan action is corporate tax reform. America now has the highest corporate tax rate in the world. This makes American businesses less competitive globally and harms job creators here at home, too. Approximately 70 percent of the corporate tax burden is ultimately borne by workers, and reform will ultimately help them by creating jobs and raising incomes. There is bipartisan agreement in Congress that we need to reduce the 35 percent corporate tax rate down to, at most, 25 percent. We can pay for these rate cuts by eliminating unnecessary and outdated loopholes that currently allow some corporations to nearly escape tax altogether. At worst, these reforms would be deficit-neutral. But if they make businesses more competitive and increase growth  as most economists believe  then these reforms would actually reduce the budget deficit. Its a win-win for businesses, workers, and the federal budget. This Q&A was conducted and condensed by Dallas Morning News editorial columnist William McKenzie.

21223,Transcript of Obama on '60 Minutes',"The following is a transcript of President Obama on CBS' ""60 Minutes."" STEVE KROFT: Four years ago, as a young senator, Barack Obama offered the country more inspiration than experience. Today, the graying president runs with all the advantages of incumbency, and all the encumbrances of a record dogged by a sluggish recovery and chronically high unemployment. For nearly two years now a Republican House has blocked almost every initiative he's offered. His signature domestic achievements, rescuing the auto industry and reforming health care remain controversial. Yet six weeks before the election, President Obama maintains a small lead in the polls. We spoke on September 12th in the White House Blue Room. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KROFT (on camera): Mr. President, you were elected four years ago, promising hope and change for the better. Your opponent argues that you have achieved neither. Country has rarely been so divided politically. And people are afraid for their jobs. I -- I know you know that. People are fearful about the future for the families. How do you respond to that? OBAMA: I think it's important to know where we've been and how far we have traveled. The month I was sworn into office, we were losing eight hundred thousand jobs a month. We ultimately would lose nine million jobs during the height of that Great Recession. We came in, made some tough decisions, everything from stabilizing the financial system to making sure that the auto industry survived, to making sure that we cut taxes for middle- class families so they had more money in their pockets, to helping states avoid massive layoffs of teachers and firefighters and police officers. And because of that we've now had thirty months of job growth, four and a half million new jobs, half a million jobs in manufacturing alone. And the question now for the American people is, ``Do we keep moving forward and continue to make progress or do we go backwards to the very policies that got us into this mess in the first place?'' We probably have not seen a clearer choice in an election in my lifetime. KROFT: On the campaign trail, Governor Romney has been portraying you as a -- a nice guy who doesn't have a clue... OBAMA: Mm-hm. KROFT: ... about the economy... OBAMA: Right. KROFT: ... or how the country works. That private enterprises -- the engine of growth in this -- in this country. And that's what create jobs, not big government. OBAMA: Yeah. KROFT: And that you're crushing economic freedom with taxes, regulations, and high-cost health care. OBAMA: Yeah. Well, it's a lot of rhetoric, but there aren't a lot of facts supporting it. Taxes are lower on families than they've been probably in the last fifty years. So I haven't raised taxes. I've cut taxes for middle-class families by an average of thirty-six hundred dollars for a typical family. When it comes to regulations, I've issued fewer regulations than my predecessor, George Bush, did during that same period in office. So it's kind of hard to argue that we've overregulated. Now, I don't make any apologies for putting in place regulations to make sure banks don't make reckless bets and then expect taxpayers to bail them out. I don't make any apologies for regulating insurance companies, so that they can't drop a family's coverage, just when somebody in their family needs it most. And, you know, the problem that Governor Romney has is that he seems to only have one note: tax cuts for the wealthy and rolling back regulations as a recipe for success. Well, we tried that vigorously between 2001 and 2008 and it didn't work out so well. KROFT: Your opponent, Governor Romney, has another note. OBAMA: Mm-hm. KROFT: That's unemployment. Forty-three months above eight percent. Huge profits on Wall Street. You've got the stock market that's doing incredibly well. And yet you've still got this unemployment. OBAMA: Oh, absolutely. Well, look, nobody's more con -- nobody's more concerned about the employment situation than I am. The problem we have was the hole was so deep when we got in that we lost nine million jobs, we've created four point six. We've still got a long way to go. Now I've put forward very specific plans that we know would create jobs. And that's not my opinion. That's the opinion of independent economists. My JOBS Act that I presented to Congress over a year ago, we said, ``Let's help put folks back to work. Let's make sure that we are getting construction workers on the job, rebuilding our infrastructure.'' It's estimated that would create an additional million jobs right now. But we haven't seen full implementation of that plan. KROFT: You've tried things that -- that haven't worked. I mean the jobs plan, the jobs bill -- you haven't been able to get it through Congress. OBAMA: Well, Steve... KROFT: I mean, isn't that some of your responsibility? OBAMA: I take full responsibility for everything that we do, Steve, but you're asking two different questions. You're asking a question, number one, have I been able to get every plan that would work through a Republican Congress... KROFT: Right. OBAMA: ... that said its number one priority was beating me as opposed to helping the American people? And there is no doubt that I've been disappointed in trying to get more cooperation from those folks. And that's something that we're going to have to continue to do. The second question you're asking, though, is has what we've done worked? And the fact of the matter is is that what we've done has been effective in improving the situation in -- in every area that we're talking about. You know when I made a decision to save the auto industry that saved a million jobs. One in eight jobs in Ohio is dependent on the auto industry. So we've actually seen success. KROFT: How are you going to get the Republicans to agree to a tax increase for the top two percent? You've been trying for a year. You haven't been able to do it. And you've got a majority of -- of -- of Republicans in Congress, including Governor Romney, who has signed a pledge never to increase taxes under any circumstances. OBAMA: Yeah, well, we... KROFT: How are you going to get them to change their minds and make this deal? OBAMA: I -- I won't get them to make them change their minds. The American people will. I mean, ultimately, the American people agree with me that the only way we bring down our deficit is to do it in a balanced way. So, keep in mind, I've agreed with the Republicans. And we've already cut a trillion dollars of spending. And I've told them I'm prepared to do additional spending cuts and do some entitlement reform. But what I've said is, ``You can't ask me to make student loans higher for kids who need it or ask seniors to pay more for their Medicare or throw people off of health care and not ask somebody like me or Mr. Romney to do anything, not ask us to do a single dime's worth of sacrifice.'' KROFT: How are you going to make a deal? OBAMA: Well, I think... KROFT: Why can't you -- why haven't you been able to make a deal? OBAMA: Well, be... KROFT: And why do you think you will be able to make a deal? OBAMA: Well, I think that when I first came into office, the head of the Senate Republicans say, ``My number one priority is making sure President Obama's a one term president.'' Now, after the election, either he will have succeeded in that goal or he will have failed at that goal. Either way, my expectation is, my hope is, that that's no longer their number one priority. And I'm hoping that after the smoke clears and the election season's over that that spirit of cooperation comes more to the fore. KROFT: You came in running as an outsider, somebody who was going to change Washington. Do you still believe after three years in this gridlock that we've had that -- that somebody who claims to be an outsider can get things accomplished in Washington? OBAMA: Oh, yeah. Well, look, I mean, we -- we passed historic legislation that strengthened our financial regulations. We passed legislation that will not only provide thirty million more people coverage, but also ensures that you know, kids can stay on their parents' health insurance plans till they are twenty-six and seniors have lower prescription drugs. And so change has happened and positive change for the American people. I -- I'm the first one to confess that the spirit that I brought to Washington, that I wanted to see instituted, where we weren't constantly in -- in a political slugfest, but were focused more on problem solving that, you know, I haven't fully accomplished that, haven't even come close in some cases. And you know if you ask me wha -- what's my biggest disappointment is that we haven't changed the tone in Washington as much as I would have liked. KROFT: And you don't bear any responsibility for that? OBAMA: Oh, I think that, you know, as President I bear responsibility for everything, to some degree and one of the things I've realized over the last two years is that that only happens if I'm enlisting the American people much more aggressively than I did the first two years. KROFT: The Great Recession began with the housing crisis. OBAMA: Mm-hm. KROFT: We still have the housing crisis. The banks got bailed out. The homeowners didn't. That was one of the decisions that you made. Very few homeowners have gotten mortgage relief. And your efforts to get the banks and the mortgage companies to renegotiate loans and modify terms have been underwhelming, to say the least. What happened? OBAMA: We have helped several million homeowners avoid foreclosure and make sure that the terms of their mortgage were ones that they could pay. Not everything you do right off the bat -- when you've got emergencies here, there, and everywhere, and we're all putting out fires -- not everything's going to work perfectly the first time. So, for example, the housing mortgage assistance program that we put in a place, we modified when we saw that there wasn't as much take-up as we wanted. And since that time, we've actually seen that the rates of people utilizing it go up dramatically. We still have a long way to go. But this is in contrast to Governor Romney's proposal. When asked about what we should do with mark -- the housing market, he said, ``Just let it bottom out.'' That's a quote. So he was opposed to even the modest proposals that we put into place. KROFT (voiceover): While most of our White House interview involved domestic policies, the President's day was dominated by foreign affairs. The attack on the Libyan consulate that left the U.S. ambassador and three others dead had occurred the night before... BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL: Wait for what? KROFT (voiceover): ... and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had inserted himself into the presidential campaign, criticizing the President and pushing him to lay out conditions for a military attack against Iran. (on camera): How much pressure have you been getting from Prime Minister Netanyahu to make up your mind to use military force in Iran? OBAMA: Well, look, I have conversations with Prime Minister Netanyahu all the time. And I understand and share Prime Minister Netanyahu's insistence that Iran should not obtain a nuclear weapon because it would threaten us, it would threaten Israel and it would threaten the world and kick off a nuclear arms race. KROFT: You're -- you're saying you don't feel any pressure from Prime Minister Netanyahu in the middle of a campaign to try and get you to change your policy and draw a line in the sand? You don't feel any pressure? OBAMA: When it comes to our national security decisions, any pressure that I feel is simply to do what's right for the American people. And I am going to block out any noise that's out there. Now I feel an obligation, not pressure but obligation, to make sure that we're in close consultation with the Israelis on these issues because it affects them deeply. They're one of our closest allies in the region. And we've got an Iranian regime that has said horrible things that directly threaten Israel's existence. KROFT: Have recent events in the Middle East given you any pause about your support for the governments that have come to power following the Arab Spring? OBAMA: Well, I'd said even at the time that this is going to be a rocky path. The question presumes that somehow we could have stopped this wave of change. I think it was absolutely the right thing for us to do to align ourselves with democracy, universal rights, a notion that people have -- have to be able to participate in their own governance. But I -- I was pretty certain and continue to be pretty -- pretty certain that there are going to be bumps in the road because, you know, in a lot of these places, the one organizing principle has been Islam. The one part of society that hasn't been controlled completely by the government. There are strains of extremism, and anti-Americanism, and anti-Western sentiment. And, you know, can -- can be tapped into by demagogues. There will probably be some times where we bump up against some of these countries and have strong disagreements but I do think that over the long term we are more likely to get a Middle East and North Africa that is more peaceful, more prosperous and more aligned with -- with our interests. This is a tumultuous time that we're in. But we can and we will meet those challenges if we stay true to who we are. (APPLAUSE) KROFT (voiceover): The day after our White House interview, we followed the President to Colorado, a crucial swing state in the upcoming election, to ask him a few more questions central to the campaign. (on camera): Most Americans think we're spending too much money. OBAMA: Mm-hm. KROFT: The national debt has gone up sixty percent in -- in the four years that you've been in office. OBAMA: Well, first -- first of all, Steve, I think it's important to understand the context here. When I came into office, I inherited the biggest deficit in our history. And over the last four years, the deficit has gone up, but ninety percent of that is as a consequence of two wars that weren't paid for, as a consequence of tax cuts that weren't paid for, a prescription drug plan that was not paid for, and then the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Now we took some emergency actions, but that accounts for about ten percent of this increase in the deficit, and we have actually seen the federal government grow at a slower pace than at any time since Dwight Eisenhower, in fact, substantially lower than the federal government grew under either Ronald Reagan or George Bush. KROFT: Since the Benghazi tragedy, your opponent has attacked you as being weak on national defense and weak on foreign policy. He says you need to be more aggressive in Iran, haven't done enough to support the revolt in Syria, and that our friends don't know where we stand, and our enemies think we're weak. OBAMA: Yeah. Well, let's see what I've done since I came into office. I said I'd end the war in Iraq. I did. I said that we'd go after Al Qaida. They've been decimated in the FATA. That we'd go after bin Laden. He's gone. So I've executed on my foreign policy. And it's one that the American people largely agree with. So, you know if -- if Governor Romney is suggesting that we should start another war, he should say so. (END VIDEOTAPE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KROFT: President Obama also reflected on the nature of leadership with us. We spoke following his campaign stop in Golden, Colorado. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KROFT (on camera): What are the essential qualities of a leader, in your mind? OBAMA: Well, you know, I -- I think that leadership more than anything is about setting a course and describing a vision for people. And you know, in the history of -- of leadership in this country that vision isn't always realized immediately. You know, Abraham Lincoln understood that we were a single union. And it took a bloody Civil War and terrible hardship and sacrifice to achieve that vision. And that vision wasn't even fully realized until after he was -- he was gone. What I try to do is to constantly present a -- a -- a vision of America in which everybody's got a shot, everybody's treated with respect and dignity in which the -- the divides of -- of race and faith, gender, sexual orientation, that that those are not the determining factors, in terms of whether people succeed but instead it's how hard you work and are you trustworthy and are you responsible and you -- do you look after your family and do you -- do you love people and love this country? KROFT: David McCullough, the noted presidential historian, said all the great Presidents have had a number of common traits. And one of them is an understanding of history and an understanding of the history of -- of the presidency. OBAMA: Yeah. KROFT: Is there anything that you've read or learned from your study of this area that has helped you? Any examples you can give me? OBAMA: Well, whenever I look at the -- the history of Presidents I deeply admire. The one thing that I'm always struck by is persistence. It's a quality that's underrated. Being able to plow through, being able to stay buoyant in the face of -- of challenges. And, you know, I think that's a characteristic of the American people. And, I think our best Presidents are able to tap into that resilience and that strength and that grit. And -- and -- and be inspired by it. KROFT: Where do you go to kind of sort things out on your own? And when do you find time to just be alone with your own thoughts? OBAMA: Well, I'm a night guy as it is. And so, Michelle usually goes to bed about 9:30. She's -- she's an early bird, maybe ten o'clock. The girls go to bed around ten. And so I've got those hours between ten o'clock and one o'clock in the morning, let's say, where not only do I do some work, but I do some reading, I do some writing. There are times where I sit on the Truman Balcony and it's as good of a view as you get with the -- the Washington Monument and the Jefferson Monument -- Memorial set back behind that. And so those are moments of reflection that, you know, help gird you for the next challenge and the next day. KROFT: Many times in our history there have been big ideas like going to the moon or the Marshall Plan. This campaign, some people think, has been devoid of big ideas, not necessarily that the budget deficit and some of these things aren't big ideas. But what would you like to see happen in your... OBAMA: Well... KROFT: ... in your four years? OBAMA: I -- I got to tell you, Steve, I think there's no bigger purpose right now than making sure that if people work hard in this country, they can get ahead. That's the central American idea. That's how we sent a man to the moon. Because there was an economy that worked for everybody and that allowed us to do that. I think what Americans properly are focused on right now are just the -- the bread- and-butter basics of making sure our economy works for working people. And if we can accomplish that there's no bigger idea than that. That's the idea that has attracted people to our shores for -- for generations.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/27/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-hes-responsible-just-10-percent-/,Economy,Polifact

21293,"Romney to college students: Pursue your dreams, even if you have to borrow to do so","WESTERVILLE, Ohio  Mitt Romney encouraged a group of several hundred college students at a small liberal arts school here Friday to pursue their educational and career ambitions  even if it means asking their parents for money if they need a hand in doing so. Addressing an auditorium full of students and faculty at Otterbein University as part of his latest effort to woo young voters, the GOP presidential frontrunner contended that President Obamas policies have amounted to an attack on success and on those who aspire to be successful. This kind of divisiveness, this attack on success is very different than what weve seen in our countrys history, he said. Weve always encouraged young people, take  take a shot, go for it. Take a risk. Get the education. Borrow money, if you have to, from your parents. Start a business. He went on to cite the example of Jimmy John, founder of the popular Illinois-based sandwich chain, who he said he had met with recently along the campaign trail. Romney told the crowd that as a young man, Jimmy John (whose full name is Jimmy John Liautaud) had borrowed $25,000 from his father in order to get his first restaurant off the ground. Liautauds father had made the loan on the condition that if his son wasnt able to return the money, with interest, within a year, he would have to join the Army. And, as you chucklingly indicated a moment ago, you know that his sandwiches are doing pretty well, Romney told the crowd. Hes got shops all over the country and thousands of people who work with him. This is kind of an American experience. Earlier Friday, in a roundtable with seven Otterbein students, one of the students raised the point that many young people cant find work related to their college majors. Romney noted that some majors tend to make it easier than others for students to find jobs post-graduation. With certain majors, theres a lot of openings ... as opposed to, say, English  as an English major, I can say this  as an English major, your options are  youd better go to graduate school and find a job from there, said Romney, who graduated with an English degree from Brigham Young University before heading to law and business school.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2012/sep/05/julian-castro/julian-castro-says-mitt-romney-advised-college-stu/,Economy,Polifact

Bernie Sanders of Vermont. During an appearance on Current TVs Viewpoint on Tuesday, Sanders blasted Republicans for blocking the legislation. What really frightens me is not just the disastrous nature of Citizens United, but the whole trend that we are seeing lately, economically, of moving this country toward an oligarchic form of government, he said. What you have right now is incredibly unequal distribution of wealth and income the Walton family of Walmart itself owns more wealth  one family  than the bottom 40 percent of the American people. Youve got that reality out there, and then whats happening now  what Citizens United is about  is these guys are not content to own the economy, to own the wealth of America, they now want to own lock, stock and barrel the political process as well.

21457,"As President Obama headed to Ohio, Rob Portman said the president squandered economic opportunity","WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama will speak soon in Cleveland, giving a campaign address in which he is expected to blast Republicans for their approach on fixing the economy. Meantime, a potential presidential-team rival on the Republican ticket, U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, said this morning that Obama's approach is -- and has been -- all wrong. For the recod, Portman stated for the umpteenth time that he is ""interested in staying where I am"" as a senator and helping a new president pass bills in Congress in 2013. His non-denial of interest in the Republican veep spot does little to quell widespread speculation that he will be Mitt Romney's running mate. That's one factor that made Portman's comments during a call with reporters noteworthy. He also represents Ohio, which Obama is visiting. And Portman was President George W. Bush's budget director from May 26, 2006 to Aug. 3, 2007. If Obama today makes a case that a Romney presidency would be like a return to the Bush White House, the comments of a former Bush budget chief could be relevant. Portman does not disagree that Obama ""inherited a tough economy, there's no question about it."" But Obama, he said, failed to adequately fix it when he took office in 2009, focusing too heavily on creating or keeping government jobs and too little on addressing the needs of the private sector. Obama has unfortunately kept that focus, Portman charged. ""His theory that he laid out was that we have to take tax dollars from you and from citizens all around our country and spend more money on government jobs,"" Portman said. ""Those government workers will then be given salaries that they then can take part of and go out and buy more, I guess, goods and services in the economy and that that is an efficient way to grow the economy. I dont think thats something that any economist who looks at our situation today would agree is the way to get out of this hole were in. I think they would say that if you look across the Atlantic, thats exactly the problem  they grew the size and scope of government too much and did not grow the private sector enough."" We have transcribed Portman's words on Obama and the economy, starting with his introductory comments and following with Portman's answer to our question on Obama's reported approach of comparing Romney's proposals to the Bush years. Introductory comments: I know the presidents in Ohio today doing another campaign stop. And Im glad hes in Ohio because it gives him the opportunity to see whats really going on in the economy. He said last week that the private sectors doing just fine and seemed to say that what we needed to do was to add government jobs to get the economy moving again. I think Ohioans get it that doesnt work. I think when hes around Ohio today hell find out that the private sectors not doing just fine. I hope he visits a factory when hes in Ohio today. Hell find out that people are struggling as they try to make ends meet amid what is the weakest economic recovery since the Great Depression. Were on the wrong track. The new jobs report that came out recently sadly had more bad news. It showed the unemployment number going up, not down. And the president tried to blame it on everything except his policies. Hes been finding excuses for months as to why the economy is not doing well. But what he has not focused on is the fact that the stimulus didnt work, nor does class warfare or anti-business rhetoric or a big-government approach including more regulations, more uncertainty, more taxes. This is not the way to get the economy moving again, and I think hell find that as he goes around Ohio if he talks to people who are in the private sector. The good news is there is a better way. There are smart ideas to help turn things around, including pro-growth tax reform, regulatory relief that is sensible, that acknowledges we need regulations but they ought to be based on cost-benefit analyses and the least-burdensome alternatives. We need a new energy plan. The exciting opportunities in Ohio and around the country to develop our own resources including shale gas and shale oil will create jobs, as well as give us more reliable and more affordable energy. So with a tax code thats more complicated than its been in decades, with regulatory and tax uncertainty freezing innovators and keeping cash on the sidelines, with spending out of control and with a real concern about where were headed in terms of the fiscal cliff, Washington needs to act and act now. In doing so, we could free up the private sector to create jobs the American economys capable of and Ohio families deserve. On Obama's campaign strategy: Well Im not going to give the president advice on his campaign strategy. What I will say is that the president inherited a tough economy, theres no question about it. The financial crisis was real, you know it occurred in 2008. And theres no question that there were some difficulties that the president had to address. The question is, what did he do with it? I would respectfully disagree that the stimulus worked. By the presidents own predictions, right now we would be under 6 percent unemployment if the stimulus had worked. Thats what he said. Thats what his advisors told him and told us. That hasnt happened, unfortunately. And the reason it hasnt happened is so much of those stimulus dollars (were) not used for anything resembling economic growth. It was used to grow the size and scope of government. And the president continues to believe this. When you listen to his comments the other day, I was much less concerned with him saying the public sectors doing just fine, because thats a point you can debate and look at. I think hes wrong, the facts say otherwise, but thats a point of debate. But what his real point was (was that) the private sectors doing fine, he said, but the government sector is not. That the reason the economy is weak is because we are losing too many government jobs. Well first of all, we are not losing government jobs. If you look at the overall net jobs in the federal government, weve actually seen an increase in federal government jobs, and pretty substantially. There have been some reductions in state and local jobs, I dont know what the net number is, but I would just make the point that I made earlier: If you are looking to grow the economy, the way to grow the economy is not to grow more public-sector jobs. Thats not even a theory that most Democrats, I hope, would agree with. His theory that he laid out was that we have to take tax dollars from you and from citizens all around our country and spend more money on government jobs. Those government workers will then be given salaries that they then can take part of and go out and buy more, I guess, goods and services in the economy and that that is an efficient way to grow the economy. I dont think thats something that any economist who looks at our situation today would agree is the way to get out of this hole were in. I think they would say that if you look across the Atlantic, thats exactly the problem  they grew the size and scope of government too much and did not grow the private sector enough. Youve got to grow the private-sector economy, which will create the opportunity for us to see more demand, to see more economic growth in the factory jobs in Ohio, in the ag sector we talked about earlier, in the service sector. And that will generate more revenue. That will help us deal with the deficit problem that we face. And it will help us to bring back jobs to a level that were more used to since the 1980s, which is in the range of 5-6 percent rather than, I really think were about 11 percent now when you look at the labor participation rates. You know, if we were just at the percent of people working who were working when President Obama was sworn in, that so-called labor participation rate, we would be at 11 percent unemployment right now. And I think thats closer to where we are even when you take out so many people who are under-employed. And that number of course is even higher, and they do keep track of those numbers, thats in the teens. So I just fundamentally disagree with the president about the approach. His approach is to help the economy, youve got to grow the government. My approach is that to help the economy, youve got to grow the private sector.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2012/jun/20/rob-portman/rob-portman-says-there-has-been-substantial-increa/,Economy,Polifact

Job growth occurred in professional and business services, manufacturing, and health care, while retail trade lost jobs. Household Survey Data The unemployment rate rose by 0.2 percentage point to 4.0 percent in June, and the number of unemployed persons increased by 499,000 to 6.6 million. A year earlier, the jobless rate was 4.3 percent, and the number of unemployed persons was 7.0 million. (See table A-1.) Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (3.7 percent), adult women (3.7 percent), and Asians (3.2 percent) increased in June. The jobless rate for teenagers (12.6 percent), Whites (3.5 percent), Blacks (6.5 percent), and Hispanics (4.6 percent) showed little or no change over the month. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.) Among the unemployed, the number of job losers and persons who completed temporary jobs increased by 211,000 in June to 3.1 million, and the number of reentrants to the labor force rose by 204,000 to 2.1 million. (Reentrants are persons who previously worked but were not in the labor force prior to beginning their job search.) (See table A-11.) The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) increased by 289,000 in June to 1.5 million. These individuals accounted for 23.0 percent of the unemployed. (See table A-12.) In June, the civilian labor force grew by 601,000. The labor force participation rate edged up by 0.2 percentage point over the month to 62.9 percent but has shown no clear trend thus far this year. (See table A-1.) The employment-population ratio, at 60.4 percent, was unchanged in June and has essentially been flat since February. (See table A-1.) The number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers) was little changed in June at 4.7 million. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were working part time because their hours had been reduced or they were unable to find full-time jobs. (See table A-8.) In June, 1.4 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, little different from a year earlier. (Data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table A-16.) Among the marginally attached, there were 359,000 discouraged workers in June, down by 155,000 from a year earlier. (Data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.1 million persons marginally attached to the labor force in June had not searched for work for reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities. (See table A-16.) Establishment Survey Data Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 213,000 in June and has grown by 2.4 million over the last 12 months. Over the month, job gains occurred in professional and business services, manufacturing, and health care, while employment in retail trade declined. (See table B-1.) Employment in professional and business services increased by 50,000 in June and has risen by 521,000 over the year. Manufacturing added 36,000 jobs in June. Durable goods manufacturing accounted for nearly all of the increase, including job gains in fabricated metal products (+7,000), computer and electronic products (+5,000), and primary metals (+3,000). Motor vehicles and parts also added jobs over the month (+12,000), after declining by 8,000 in May. Over the past year, manufacturing has added 285,000 jobs. Employment in health care rose by 25,000 in June and has increased by 309,000 over the year. Hospitals added 11,000 jobs over the month, and employment in ambulatory health care services continued to trend up (+14,000). Construction employment continued to trend up in June (+13,000) and has increased by 282,000 over the year. Mining employment continued on an upward trend in June (+5,000). The industry has added 95,000 jobs since a recent low point in October 2016, almost entirely in support activities for mining. In June, retail trade lost 22,000 jobs, largely offsetting a gain in May (+25,000). Employment showed little or no change over the month in other major industries, including wholesale trade, transportation and warehousing, information, financial activities, leisure and hospitality, and government. The average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at 34.5 hours in June. In manufacturing, the workweek edged up by 0.1 hour to 40.9 hours, and overtime edged up by 0.1 hour to 3.5 hours. The average workweek for production and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls remained at 33.8 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.) In June, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 5 cents to $26.98. Over the year, average hourly earnings have increased by 72 cents, or 2.7 percent. Average hourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees increased by 4 cents to $22.62 in June. (See tables B-3 and B-8.) The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for April was revised up from +159,000 to +175,000, and the change for May was revised up from +223,000 to +244,000. With these revisions, employment gains in April and May combined were 37,000 more than previously reported. (Monthly revisions result from additional reports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.) After revisions, job gains have averaged 211,000 per month over the last 3 months. _____________ The Employment Situation for July is scheduled to be released on Friday, August 3, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. (EDT). _______________________________________________________________________________________ | | | 2018 Preliminary Benchmark Revision to the Establishment Survey Data will be | | Released on August 22, 2018 | | | |Each year, the establishment survey estimates are benchmarked to comprehensive counts | |of employment from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) for the month | |of March.

21513,Mandel developing rescue plan,"By David Skolnick _EMAIL_ YOUNGSTOWN Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, said he is developing a plan to rescue the auto industry. When asked about the $82 billion government bailout of General Motors and Chrysler in 2009, Mandel said in a Thursday call to The Vindicator, Our economy has not yet been rescued. So many people are still out of work. GM earned its largest profit ever in 2011, two years after the bailout. GM, with a complex in Lordstown that builds the Chevrolet Cruze, made a $7.6 billion profit last year. It received $49.5 billion of the bailout money. Im not saying the bailout didnt work, Mandel said. But Mandel said he respectfully disagreed that it saved the American auto industry. Justin Barasky, spokesman for U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, the Democrat incumbent who Mandel would face in the November general election if the latter wins Tuesdays Republican primary, mocked the state treasurers comments. Mandels claim to be putting together a plan to rescue the industry is a laughably candid example of how completely clueless he is as to whats going on with Ohios middle class and how hell say anything to get elected, Barasky said. Brown was a vocal proponent who voted for the auto bailout, which saved thousands of jobs in Ohio, Barasky said. Also, Mandel said responsible oil and gas exploration is a key platform of his Senate campaign. When asked in mid- January about the decision by Gov. John Kasich, a fellow Republican, to declare a moratorium on brine- injection wells within a seven-mile radius of a Youngstown well, near the epicenter of 12 earthquakes, a Mandel campaign spokesman said the candidate doesnt have an opinion on it. The earthquakes attracted international media attention. On Thursday, Mandel said he wasnt familiar with the decision at the time, but now that I learned more about it, the governor took a responsible approach. Barasky said Mandel is admitting ignorance about natural-gas exploration. Though hes campaigned for the Senate seat for a year and turned in nominating petitions by the Dec. 7 deadline, Mandel said he officially announced his candidacy Thursday, less than a week before the Tuesday primary. He said he waited because he wanted to clean up the treasurers office, something he said he did this week. We are now running one of the most effective and efficient treasurers offices in the country, he said. Mandel, who criticized Brown as an ineffective career politician, will make a campaign stop at 10 a.m. Saturday at Eastwood Malls community room in Niles. I think the Mahoning Valley is going to be one of the key areas in America that helps rebuild the manufacturing backbone of our country, he said.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2012/may/18/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-campaign-says-josh-mandel-opposes-au/,Economy,Polifact
21524,"Remarks by the President, Albany, NY","College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering State University of New York Albany, New York 1:24 P.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT: Hello, New York! (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat. It is great to be back in Albany. It is wonderful to be with all of you here today. And I want to thank Governor Cuomo not only for the outstanding introduction, but also for the extraordinary leadership that he's showing here in the great state of New York. Please give him a big round of applause. (Applause.) He is doing outstanding work. I also want to thank Mayor Jennings, who's here. Give the Mayor a big round of applause. (Applause.) Don't be shy. We've got Chancellor Zimpher -- (applause) -- we appreciate very much. Dr. Kaloyeros -- I want to make sure I say that right, folks mess up my name all the time -- (laughter) -- Kaloyeros for hosting us here today. (Applause.) Weve got a couple members of Congress here -- Paul Tonko. (Applause.) And also, Representative Chris Gibson is here. (Applause.) And all of you are, and I'm happy about that. (Applause.) Yes. So it is wonderful to be here at the University of Albany NanoCollege. This is one of the only colleges in the world dedicated to nanotechnology. And its a incredible complex. But youre working on particles as small as an atom, and youre doing it in rooms that are 10,000 times cleaner than a hospital operating room - which is very impressive, since ""clean"" is not usually a word I associate with college students. (Laughter.) Maybe things have changed since I was in school. Now, the reason I came here today is because this school -- bless you -- and this community represents the future of our economy. Right now, some of the most advanced manufacturing work in America is being done right here in upstate New York. Cutting-edge businesses from all over the world are deciding to build here and hire here. And youve got schools like this one that are training workers with the exact skills that those businesses are looking for. Now, we know the true engine of job creation in this country is the private sector -- it's not Washington. But there are steps we can take as a nation to make it easier for companies to grow and to hire, to create platforms of success for them -- everything from giving more people the chance to get the right training and education to supporting new research projects into science and technology. In fact, there was a substantial investment made here -- I was talking to Governor Cuomo about the investment his father made here to help get this center started. There are things we can do to make sure that if youre willing to work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can find a job, own a home, maybe start a business, and most importantly, give your kids a chance to do even better than you did. And thats something we believe has to be available to everybody, no matter where you come from, no matter what you look like. We can make a difference. And at this make-or-break moment for America's middle class, theres no excuse for inaction. Theres no excuse for dragging our feet. None. Now, over the last few years, there are certain steps that Ive been able to take on my own to help spur the kind of innovation that we're seeing here, and also to help the overall economy grow. So we announced a new policy several months back that will help families refinance their mortgages, save up to thousands of dollars a year. We sped up loans and competitive grants for new projects all across the country so thousands of construction workers can get back on the job. We simplified the student loan process to help roughly 5.8 million students -- like the students here -- save money on repayments. (Applause.) So these are some steps that the administration has been able to take on its own. But the truth is, the only way we can accelerate the job creation that takes place on a scale that is needed is bold action from Congress. Because of the Recovery Act, because of all the work we've done, we've created over 4 million jobs over the last two years. We've created hundreds of thousands of jobs each month over the last several months. So we're making progress, but everybody knows we need to do more. And in order to do that, we're going to need some more action from Congress. Democrats and Republicans have to come together. And they've shown that they can do it. I mean, they did some important work. They passed tax cuts for workers, approved trade deals to open up new markets for American products. We reformed our patent system to make it easier for innovative ideas to come to market. Those are all good things. But the size of the challenges we face requires us to do more. So back last September, I sent Congress a jobs bill that included all sorts of policies that we knew would help grow our economy and put more Americans back to work. That wasn't just my opinion, that wasn't just the opinion of Democrats. It was the opinion of independent, nonpartisan experts -- economists who do this for a living, and analysts on Wall Street who evaluate what's going to really make the economy grow. The one big piece that we were able to get done was make sure that we didn't see payroll tax go up and people get 40 bucks taken out of their paychecks each time. But most of it didn't get done in Congress. Just about every time we put these policies up for a vote, the Republicans in Congress got together and they said no. They said no to putting hundreds of thousands of construction workers back on the job repairing our roads and our bridges and our schools and our transit systems. No to a new tax cut for businesses that hire new workers. No to putting more teachers back in our classrooms, more cops back on the beat, more firefighters back to work. And this is at a time when we know one of the biggest drags on our economy has been layoffs by state and local governments -- that's true all across the country. And it's worth noting, by the way -- this is just a little aside -- after there was a recession under Ronald Reagan, government employment went way up. It went up after the recessions under the first George Bush and the second George Bush. So each time there was a recession with a Republican President, compensated -- we compensated by making sure that government didn't see a drastic reduction in employment. The only time government employment has gone down during a recession has been under me. (Applause.) So I make that point just so you don't buy into this whole bloated government argument that you hear. And frankly, if Congress had said yes to helping states put teachers back to work and put the economy before our politics, then tens of thousands more teachers in New York would have a job right now. That is a fact. And that would mean not only a lower unemployment rate, but also more customers for business. Now, I know this is an election year. But it's not an excuse for inaction. Six months is plenty of time for Democrats and Republicans to get together and do the right thing, taking steps that will spur additional job creation right now. Just saying no to ideas that we know will help our economy isnt an option. Theres too much at stake. We've all got to pull in the same direction. So even if Republicans are still saying no to some of the bigger proposals we made in the jobs act, there are some additional ideas that could help people get to work right now and that they haven't said no to yet -- so I'm hoping they say yes. And theyre simple ideas. Theyre the kinds of things that, in the past, have been supported by Democrats and Republicans. These are traditionally ideas that have had bipartisan support. They wont have as big of an impact as rebuilding our infrastructure or helping states hire back teachers, but together, all of these ideas will do two things: They'll grow the economy faster and they'll create more jobs. So today Im announcing a handy little ""To-Do"" list that weve put together for Congress. (Laughter.) You can see it for yourselves at whitehouse.gov. Its about the size of a Post-It note, so every member of Congress should have time to read it -- (laughter) -- and they can glance at it every so often. And hopefully we'll just be checking off the list -- just like when Michelle gives me a list, I check it off. (Laughter.) Each of the ideas on this list will help accelerate our economy and put people back to work -- not in November, not in next year, but right now. All right, so I'm going to go through the list. First, Congress needs to help the millions of Americans who have worked hard, made their mortgage payments on time, but still have been unable to refinance their mortgages with these historically low rates. This would make a huge difference for the economy. (Applause.) Families could save thousands of dollars, and that means they've got more money in their pocket, which means they can either build their equity back up on their homes or they go out and use that money to do things like helping their kids finance a college education. So Congress should give those responsible homeowners a chance to refinance at a lower rate. We estimate they'd save at least $3,000 a year. So thats on our ""To-Do"" list. It's not complicated. (Applause.) Second, if Congress fails to act soon, clean energy companies will see their taxes go up and they could be forced to lay off employees. In fact, we're already hearing from folks who produce wind turbines and solar panels and a lot of this green energy that they're getting worried because there's uncertainty out there. Congress hasn't renewed some of the tax breaks that are so important to this industry. And since I know that the other side in Congress have promised they'll never raise taxes as long as they live, this is a good time to keep that promise when it comes to businesses that are putting Americans to work and helping break our dependence on foreign oil. (Applause.) So we should extend these tax credits. Thats on the ""To-Do"" list. Thats number two. Number three, Congress should help small business owners by giving them a tax break for hiring more workers and paying them higher wages. (Applause.) We believe small businesses are the engine of economic growth in this country. We should not hold them to a situation where they may end up having to pay higher taxes just by hiring more workers. We should make it easier for them to succeed. So thats on our ""To-Do"" list. Thats number three. Number four, Congress should help our veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan find a good job once they come home. (Applause.) Our men and women in uniform have served this country with such honor and distinction -- a lot of them come from upstate New York. Now its our turn to serve them. So we should create a Veterans Job Corps that helps them find work as cops and firefighters, employees at our national parks. Thats on our ""To-Do"" list. Then the last item, the fifth item, which bears especially on what's going on here -- the last item on our congressional ""To-Do"" list is something that will help a lot of you in particular. You know better than anybody that technology has advanced by leaps and bounds over the last few decades. And thats a great thing. Businesses are more productive; consumers are getting better products for less. But technology has also made a lot of jobs obsolete. Factories where people once thought theyd retire suddenly left town. Jobs that provided a decent living got shipped overseas. And the result has been a lot of pain for a lot of communities and a lot of families. There is a silver lining to all of this, though. After years of undercutting the competition, now its getting more expensive to do business in places like China. Wages are going up. Shipping costs are going up. And meanwhile, American workers are getting more and more efficient. Companies located here are becoming more and more competitive. So for a lot of businesses, its now starting to make sense to bring jobs back home. (Applause.) And here in the tri-city area, youve got companies like IBM and Global Foundries that could have decided to pack up and move elsewhere, but they chose to stay in upstate New York because it made more sense to build here and to hire here. You have more to offer -- got some of the best workers in the world, you've got an outstanding university. Now I want whats happening in Albany to happen all across the country -- places like Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh. (Applause.) I want to create more opportunities for hardworking Americans to start making things again, and selling them all over the world stamped with those proud words: Made in America. Thats the goal. (Applause.) So the good news is were already starting to see it happen. American manufacturers are creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s. And thats good for you, but its also good for the businesses that supply the materials you use. Its good for the construction workers who build the facilities you work in. Its good for communities where people are buying more houses and spending more money at restaurants and stores. Everybody benefits when manufacturing is going strong. So youve heard about outsourcing. Today, more and more companies are insourcing. One recent study found that half of Americas largest companies are thinking of moving their manufacturing operations from China back to the United States of America. (Applause.) Thats good news. Because even when we cant make things cheaper than other countries because of their wage rates, we can always make them better. Thats who we are. Thats what America is all about. (Applause.) So this brings me back to our ""To-Do"" list. What we need to do now is to make it easier for more companies to do the right thing, and one place to start is our tax code. At the moment, companies get tax breaks for moving factories, jobs and profits overseas. They can actually end up saving on their tax bill when they make the move. Meanwhile, companies that choose to stay here are getting hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world. That doesnt make sense. And politicians from both parties have been talking about changing it for years, so Ive put forward my own plan to make it right in the long term. But in the short term, before we completely rework the tax code, before we've done a full-blown tax reform, at the very least what we can do right away is stop rewarding companies who ship jobs overseas and use that money to cover moving expenses for companies that are moving jobs back here to America. (Applause.) So we're putting that on Congresss ""To-Do"" list. This is something simple to do. We shouldnt wait. We should get it done right now. So thats the fifth item. That's all on our ""To-Do"" list. I'm not trying to overload Congress here. (Laughter.) So over the next few weeks, Im going to be taking about this ""To-Do"" list when I'm on the road. Im going to be talking about all the things that Congress can do right now to boost our economy and accelerate even more job growth. Of course, its not enough just to give them the list -- we've also got to get them to start crossing things off the list. And thats where all of you come in. I'm going to need you to pick up the phone, write an email, tweet, remind your member of Congress we cant afford to wait until November to get things done. Tell them now is the time to help more Americans save money on their mortgages; time for us to invest more in clean energy and small businesses; it's time for us to help more veterans find work; and it's time to make it easier for companies to bring jobs back to America. It's the right thing to do. Now, I'm cheating a little bit. I said that was my ""To-Do"" list. There actually is one other thing they've got to do. Before they do anything else, Congress needs to keep student loan rates from doubling for students who are here and all across the country. (Applause.) That has to happen by January 1st [sic] or rates on Stafford loans double. These young people are nodding their heads -- they don't like that. They've heard about this. (Laughter.) And we need to pass a transportation bill that guarantees almost a million construction workers can stay on the job. (Applause.) The good news is both parties say they want to make this happen. Weve done this before. So Congress just needs to work out the details. Don't let politics get in the way. Get this done before July 1st. Those bills should be passed right now. So I'm cheating a little bit. There are actually seven items on the ""To-Do"" list. (Laughter.) But two of them are old business and folks have already said they want to get them done. Albany, weve got a long way to go if were going to make sure everybody who wants a job can find one, and every family can feel that sense of security that was the essence of America's middle-class experience. But we can't just go back to the way things used to be. We've got to move forward -- to an economy where everybody gets a fair shot, everybody is doing their fair share, everybody plays by the same set of rules. And that's what you guys are doing here in Albany. You're investing in your future. You're not going backwards, you're going forward. With your help, I know we can get there -- because here in America, we dont give up. We keep moving. We look out for one another. We pull each other up. Thats who we are. And if we work together with common purpose, I've got no doubt we can keep moving this country forward and remind the world just why it is the United States of America is the greatest nation on Earth. (Applause.) Thank you so much, everybody. God bless you. God bless America. (Applause.) END 1:44 P.M.

21537,Buffett rule fails Senate vote in tax fight,"WASHINGTON  - Senate Republicans on Monday blocked President Barack Obamas Buffett Rule legislation, which would have put a 30-percent minimum tax on millionaires, in a debate that is likely to resonate through the November general election. President Barack Obama speaks about the Buffett Rule in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House complex in Washington, April 11, 2012. REUTERS/Larry Downing Democrats, as expected, failed to garner the 60 votes needed in the 100-member Senate to move to a full debate and vote on the bill aimed at getting more tax revenues out of the wealthy. Obama and congressional Republicans are squaring off this week over the tax hikes for millionaires and a Republican plan to give new tax cuts for businesses. Tonight, Senate Republicans voted to block the Buffett Rule, choosing once again to protect tax breaks for the wealthiest few Americans at the expense of the middle class, Obama said in a statement. Though scant changes to tax policy are expected ahead of the November 6 election, the skirmishes are giving voters a preview of debates they will hear over the next seven months. Obama and his fellow Democrats argue that raising taxes on the rich will help reduce deficits and bring more fairness to the tax code. Republicans are pushing a much different narrative of tax cuts - even if they add to deficits - as a way of creating jobs. As Americans scurried to file tax returns by Tuesday, the Senate debated the Buffett Rule, which would require households earning more than $1 million to pay at least a 30-percent tax rate. Central to Obamas tax fairness re-election campaign theme, the rule is named after billionaire Warren Buffett, who supports it and famously complains that he pays a lower effective tax rate than his secretary. Republicans argued that raising taxes would hurt the fragile economy. Fifty-one senators voted for the bill, while 45 senators voted no, effectively killing it. Republican Senator Susan Collins voted for the tax hike, while Democratic Senator Mark Pryor voted against it. A series of pivotal decisions on tax policy are looming at the year-end, when lower tax rates for all individuals - enacted under former President George W. Bush - are set to expire. These include estate, capital gains and dividend tax rates. Economists worry that partisan wrangling after the presidential and congressional elections could stall action on those decisions and several other measures, hobbling the economic recovery. Politicians time would be better spent working on an overhaul of the tax system that could actually pass rather than reforms that are likely to go nowhere, said Maya MacGuineas, president of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Budget. CLASS WARFARE? Republicans say the Buffett measure will do nothing to solve the larger problem of deficits and unemployment. We have a president that seems more interested in pitting people against each other than he is in doing anything, said Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell. He was hitting on a Republican theme that raising taxes on the rich was tantamount to class warfare. On Thursday Republicans - in firm control the House of Representatives - are expected to debate and likely approve a bill to give a one-year, 20-percent tax deduction on business income to owners of businesses with fewer than 500 employees. Republicans are portraying that tax cut as one for small businesses, a group they say the Buffett Rule will harm. Democrats say the legislation will add to already huge budget deficits, since Republicans do not include any measures to offset the $46 billion revenue loss. And they cite studies showing that the tax cut will mainly go to those with incomes over $200,000 a year. That measure is not likely to make it through the Senate. BATTLE ESCALATING The battle over taxes has been escalating for weeks with the White House speaking nearly daily about the Buffett Rule. The Obama campaign played offense last week by releasing the presidents tax returns several days before the deadline, to put pressure on Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Obama and his wife paid about 20.5 percent of their income in taxes in 2011, compared to an estimated 15.4 percent rate paid by the Romneys. Romney, however, has asked for an extension to file his taxes. A Gallup poll out on Monday said that Americans are split fairly evenly between those who say their federal tax bill is fair and those who say they pay too much. But when asked specifically about how the wealthy are taxed, about 60 percent back some kind of Buffett Rule, Gallups surveys have found. It is a robust finding across whichever polls that ask, you usually get 60 percent plus that say, yes, higher income are paying too little, Frank Newport, editor in chief of Gallup polling, said. The polling, telephone interviews with about 1,000 adults, has a margin of error of 4 percentage points.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2012/may/06/sheldon-whitehouse/sheldon-whitehouse-said-47-billion-raised-over-10-/,Economy,Polifact
21662,Fourth Time's A Charm: How Donald Trump Made Bankruptcy Work For Him,"Here at FORBES, we've been tracking Donald Trump's wealth since the inaugural Forbes 400 rich list in 1982. Today, we value him at $2.7 billion, although he claims he's worth far more. One question we're often asked when talk turns to Trump's fortune: how can a man who has been bankrupt so many times remain a multi-billionaire? How is he worth more now, post-bankruptcies? We spoke to bankruptcy lawyers and casino industry experts -- some of whom have had firsthand involvement in Chapter 11 cases connected to Trump -- in an attempt to explain how he has survived corporate bankruptcies and thrived in the aftermath. 1. It's nothing personal... First things first: Donald Trump has filed for corporate bankruptcy four times, in 1991, 1992, 2004 and 2009. All of these bankruptcies were connected to over-leveraged casino and hotel properties in Atlantic City, all of which are now operated under the banner of Trump Entertainment Resorts. He has never filed for personal bankruptcy -- an important distinction when considering his ability to emerge relatively unscathed, at least financially. ""Corporations, limited partnerships, and LLCs in which he had an ownership interest or companies that had his name attached have filed for bankruptcy,"" said Michael Viscount of Atlantic City law firm Fox Rothschild LLP, who represented unsecured creditors when Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts, as it was then called, filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2004. ""Therein lies the big distinction. (See: Trump Exaggerating His Net Worth (By 100%) In Presidential Bid) He did take a personal hit the first time around: he'd financed the construction of the Trump Taj Mahal with junk bonds and was unable to pay the high interest. His business was in the red, and so was he, to the tune of about $900 million in personal debt. By the mid-90s, he'd reduced most of that debt, selling his Trump Princess yacht, his Trump Shuttle airline, and his stake in a handful of other businesses. More importantly, he stopped guaranteeing debt with his own wealth. ""The first bankruptcy was the only time his personal fortune was at stake,"" said Ted Connolly, a Boston bankruptcy lawyer who used Trump as model for getting out of debt in his book The Road Out Of Debt: Bankruptcy and Other Solutions to Your Financial Problems. ""He learned from it. He's insulated."" 2. ...it's just business. Trump has never apologized for using Chapter 11 as a business tool -- indeed, when he spoke to my FORBES colleague Keren Blankfeld recently, he noted that many ""great entrepreneurs"" have used bankruptcy to restructure debt, free up capital and improve their businesses. ""Ive cut debt -- by the way, this isnt me personally, its a company,"" Trump said. ""Basically Ive used the laws of the country to my advantage and to other peoples advantage just as Leon Black has, Carl Icahn, Henry Kravis has, just as many, many others on top of the business world have."" But to those uninitiated in bankruptcy laws, four instances of corporate bankruptcy in a row can seem staggering. ""To the ordinary person in the street, it may seem surprising, but certainly not to me,"" said Reed Smith partner Michael Venditto, who has represented clients in high profile Chapter 11 cases, including bankrupt airline TWA. ""Chapter 11 is how you reshape and restructure a company that has problems. It doesn't indicate anything nefarious or even bad management."" 3. It's better than the alternative. More important, said Venditto, are the repercussions Chapter 11 might have for creditors versus, say, liquidation. ""You can have a visceral reaction to the fact that this company has gone through Chapter 11 multiple times, but the bondholders look at it and the alternatives are much, much worse. What is an empty casino sitting on the Atlantic City boardwalk worth? If it's operating and it's got cash flow and income, it may not be able to pay back every cent on the dollar, but the creditors are better off in the long run."" 4. He's leveraged his persona. Trump's name and image have undoubtedly helped him survive each bankruptcy and come out on top. He's able to demand a high percentage of reorganization equity based on the value his brand brings to a casino or hotel operation. So says Edward Weisfelner, a partner at New York firm Brown Rudnick who was involved in two of the three casino bankruptcies, first representing bondholders, then as counsel to Carl Icahn's firm Icahn Partners, who tried to buy most of the debt in Trump Entertainment Resorts. The leverage he had was that his name was on the side of his casinos,"" said Weisfelner. ""The cost of throwing him out, rebranding and changing his name everywhere would be very high. "" Added Joseph Weinert, senior vice president at Atlantic City casino consultancy Spectrum Gaming Group, who has produced research for Trump: ""The stakeholders decided they were better off with Trump's name than they were without it."" 5. He has less and less interest in the bankrupt companies. With each bankruptcy proceeding, Donald Trump's stake in the casinos and hotels in Atlantic city that bear his name has decreased. In the first Trump Taj Mahal bankruptcy, he handed over 50% equity to bondholders in return for favorable interest rates. In 2004's Chapter 11 filing, his stake was reduced to 25%. During wranglings with bondholders immediately before the 2009 bankruptcy, Trump resigned from the board of Trump Entertainment Resorts; his equity stake is now 5%, with another 5% in warrants. 6. He's not the one to blame. Atlantic City lawyer Viscount doesn't believe Donald Trump himself should be held accountable for any of his company's bankruptcies -- his creditors, he said, knew what they were getting themselves into when they lent Trump money over and over again. Theyre all big boys and girls,"" he said. ""Theyve all played this game before, in the insolvency space. The company that possessed his name filed bankruptcy because it was overleveraged. What does that tell you? People want to lend him money. He does grandiose things with it.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2012/mar/15/robert-jacquard/rhode-island-state-rep-robert-b-jacquard-says-many/,Economy,Polifact
22033,"Remarks by the President on the American Jobs Act in Emporia, VA","Greensville County High School Emporia, Virginia 5:43 P.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT: Hello! (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Hello, Eagles! (Applause.) Well, it is good to be here. Thank you very much. (Applause.) It's great to be back in Virginia. (Applause.) It is great to be here at Greensville County High School. (Applause.) I want to thank Jami Clements not only for the gracious introduction, but congratulate her on being selected as Greensville County Teacher of the Year. (Applause.) We're proud of everything that Jami has accomplished here at the school, but we also want to thank her for her service in our armed forces, and that is an extraordinary combination of service -- teaching and serving. (Applause.) And I know that the students feel very lucky to have her in the classroom. And I like that she's teaching biology, because we need some scientists out there. In addition, I want to acknowledge, first of all the superintendent of schools, Philip Worrell. Give your superintendent a big round of applause. (Applause.) And I want to acknowledge the principal, Wayne Scott. (Applause.) And finally, I want to thank your mayor, Mr. Sam Adams, for being with us here today. (Applause.) Now, some of you may have heard were taking a little road trip at the beginning of this week. The RV is a little bigger than most. (Laughter.) We've got it parked outside. But I decided it was time to get out of Washington and hit the open road. (Applause.) So we landed in Asheville, North Carolina -- and that truly is God's country -- and we drove through beautiful mountain roads and stopped for some barbecue and a little sweet tea. And we went to Boone County, North Carolina, and they had a general store there with big barrels of candy, and so we stocked up for Halloween and -- dont tell Michelle. (Laughter.) But we bought a lot of candy. (Laughter.) But most importantly, the reason that we have been traveling on the road is because I wanted to hear from folks like you. It doesnt seem like your voices are heard enough in Washington. (Applause.) They don't seem to be listening. So I figured if I brought the press here, then they could hear you. Because times are tough for a lot of Americans. Here in Virginia, there are a lot of folks who've spent months, maybe some folks spent years, looking for work. Others are doing their best just to get by. Maybe they're giving up going out to a restaurant -- they just can't afford it. They've got to save on gas. End of the month they're worried about making the mortgage payment. Some people are postponing retirement to make sure that their children can go to college. Hours have been cut back. Family businesses on the brink of being shut down. So its hard. And I think most Americans know that our economic problems werent caused overnight. Obviously we're going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and the aftermath hit Main Streets all across the country. But even before the financial crisis hit, people had seen their wages flat, their incomes flat. Had a chance to meet some farmers back here today -- crops are good this year, but family farms have been going through tough times. Health care skyrocketing in terms of cost. College tuition skyrocketing. AUDIENCE: Yes! THE PRESIDENT: We don't have an energy policy in this country, so we're still dependent on foreign oil. When gas shoots up, suddenly everybody doesnt know what to do. These are problems that built up over a decade or more. They wont be solved overnight. It's going to take time to rebuild an America -- (applause) -- to rebuild an America where hard work is valued and responsibility is rewarded; where people don't feel like they've got the deck stacked against them; where everybody is getting a fair shot and everybody is contributing their fair share. It is going to take time to rebuild an America where we restore security for the middle class and opportunity for folks trying to get in the middle class, an economy that works for everybody and not just for folks at the top. Thats our goal. (Applause.) And it will take time to rebuild an economy that is competitive in the 21st century, thats built to last -- one where we can out-build and out-compete, out-educate, out-innovate other nations -- which means weve got to step up on our education. Weve got to invest in basic science. Weve got to improve our infrastructure. We've got to close our deficits. We've got to get our fiscal house in order. We got a lot of work to do. Its going to take time. But Im here to tell you we are going to get it done. We are going to keep fighting. (Applause.) Were going to keep striving. Were going to focus on putting people back to work and helping middle-class Americans get ahead, and we will give the economy the jolt that it needs. And there are things that we can be doing right now to help the American people. Thats why I sent Congress the American Jobs Act. This is a jobs bill that contains the kind of proposals that in the past have been supported by both Democrats and Republicans. Its a bill thats paid for. It will not add to the deficit. It will not be going on the credit card. It will be paid for by asking our wealthiest citizens, our most fortunate -- people like me -- people who are making more than a million dollars, to pay their fair share. (Applause.) Independent economists have looked at this jobs bill, and theyve said it will create nearly 2 million jobs. Thats not my opinion, thats not the opinion of folks who work for me -- thats the opinion of people who study the economy for a living. They tell us this will grow the economy and put people back to work right away. So the question is, if its paid for, wont add to the deficit, wont result in increasing your taxes, will instead result in lowering your taxes, will put people back to work at a time when the unemployment rate is too high -- why wouldnt we do it? Why wouldnt we pass it? It turns out the folks in Washington arent listening to you. Last week, all the Republicans in the United States Senate got together and they blocked this jobs bill. They refused to even debate it, even though a majority of senators wanted it debated. But in the Senate youve got this rule where you got to get these days 60 votes to get something through. Just a majority doesnt seem to be enough. Meanwhile, one poll found that 63 percent of Americans support the ideas in this jobs bill. And yet 100 percent of Republicans in the Senate voted against it. Does that make any sense? AUDIENCE: No! THE PRESIDENT: Now, some people asked me yesterday why Im visiting some place in North Carolina and Virginia that are mostly Republican. (Laughter.) What I said was, Im not the Democratic President, Im not the Republican President -- Im the President. (Applause.) Im everybodys President. I don't care if youre a Republican or a Democrat. This is not the Republican jobs act, this is not called the Democratic jobs act -- this is the American Jobs Act. And everybody would be better off if we passed it. (Applause.) Now, in fairness, let me say that after I sent Congress the American Jobs Act, Republicans decided, well, wed better put out our own jobs act. So they started out calling it the ""Real American Jobs Act"" -- thats what they called it. So they don't get points for originality. (Laughter.) But lets examine what was in this jobs act. I said lets see what youve got. As it turns out, the Republicans' plan boils down to a few basic ideas, and these are ideas weve heard before. They said, were going to lower taxes for the wealthiest Americans and corporations. Were going to gut environmental regulations. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: Were going to drill more. Were going to let Wall Street do what they were doing before we got into this mess. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: And were going to repeal health care reform. AUDIENCE: No! THE PRESIDENT: All right, now, that is a plan -- but its not a jobs plan. (Applause.) Thats a plan, but its a plan to go back to doing the exact things that we were doing before we had a financial crisis that put so many people out of work. Why would we think that it would work now? I mean, lets do a little comparison-shopping here. Lets kick the tires a little bit on each plan. The Republican plan says that the only thing that's standing between us and full employment are laws that keep ours companies from polluting our air and our water. My plan says lets put teachers back in the classroom. Lets put police and firefighters back on the job. Lets hire construction workers to rebuild America. Lets put our veterans back on the job. (Applause.) Their plan says wed be better off if we kick 30 million Americans who are slated to get health care off the rolls. So the young people, for example, who are already getting health insurance by staying on their parent's plan, theyd be out of luck. I don't know how that will contribute to creating jobs. Our plan says were better off if we give a tax cut to virtually every small business and every worker in America. That's in the American Jobs Act. (Applause.) Their plan says lets go back and let Wall Street do exactly what they were doing before the financial crisis. Lets roll back all the Wall Street reforms that we fought tooth and nail to pass over the objections of lobbyists and special interests in Washington. Our plan says we need to make it easier for small businesses on Main Street to get financing and to hire and to push this economy forward. Now -- so those are the two plans. Remember those -- group of economists who said our plan would create jobs? Well, we asked one of them to take a look at the Republican plan. We said, well, maybe were missing something here. Maybe we don't understand exactly what their strategy is. So we asked independent economists, please evaluate their plan. And the economist says, well, you know what, this plan would actually cost jobs. It won't do much to help the economy right now when folks are hurting, and could actually result in fewer jobs, not more jobs. So I don't know how you present a plan for jobs that results in less jobs. (Laughter.) Right? I mean, they didn't call it the ""American No Jobs Act."" (Laughter.) So the question is, Virginia, do you want a plan that results in dirtier air and water for our kids, and fewer people on health care, and less accountability on Wall Street? AUDIENCE: No! THE PRESIDENT: Or do we want to keep pushing a plan that puts more teachers in the classroom? AUDIENCE: Yes! THE PRESIDENT: More construction workers rebuilding our schools? AUDIENCE: Yes! THE PRESIDENT: Tax cuts for small business owners and working families? AUDIENCE: Yes! THE PRESIDENT: Thats the choice that we face. And Ill let you decide which plan is the real American Jobs Act. I just want to be clear. I want desperately to work with Republicans on ways to create jobs right now. Think about it. Nobody is more interested -- other than the folks who are actually out of work -- than me in seeing this economy growing strong. Im open to any serious idea that is presented to create jobs. Just last week, Congress passed a bipartisan trade deal with Korea that will allow us to sell more American goods overseas, create more jobs here. My attitude is we're buying a whole lot of Hyundais and Kias; I want to see some Koreans buying some Fords and Chryslers and Chevys. (Applause.) I want them to buy some fine Virginia peanuts. (Applause.) I know they use peanuts over there, but I'll bet they're not as good as Virginia peanuts. (Applause and laughter.) There's some good peanuts. (Laughter.) AUDIENCE MEMBER: Emporia peanuts! (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT: So thats the kind of progress on our economy that we can keep on making, but to do so we've got to stop playing politics all the time. We cant just try to satisfy one wing of one party. Weve got to pull together, focus on creating jobs and helping the middle class right now, and helping people get into the middle class. So what I decided was lets give Congress another chance. Were going to give them another chance to listen to you, to step up to the plate, to do the right thing. We will give them another chance to do their jobs so that you can keep your job or get a job. (Laughter.) And so I was thinking about it. I was thinking, well, maybe there was just too much stuff in my bill. Maybe it was confusing to have all these component parts. So what we decided is were going to break it up into smaller pieces so that we dont confuse anybody, and let them vote on each piece one at a time. That way, you can be crystal clear on where everybody stands on the different components of the American Jobs Act. So the first vote we asked Congress to take is scheduled for later this week. And its a vote thats going to put hundreds of thousands of police back on the beat, and firefighters back on the job, and teachers back in the classroom where they belong. (Applause.) And you know why this is so important? I dont have to tell you this. We are competing against Germany and China and Korea and all these countries, and they are hiring teachers in droves. They are focused on making sure their children are topnotch in math and science and technology. And yet, here all over the country, including here in Virginia, budget cuts are forcing schools to lay off teachers in disturbing numbers. Here in Greensville County, youve lost some teachers. You could lose more if we dont pass this jobs bill, and thats not right. Its unfair to our kids. It undermines our future. We cant have other countries adding teachers to prepare their kids for the global economy while we sit by and do nothing. As one teacher down in North Carolina said, We didnt cause the poor economy -- us teachers. If anything, we built the good parts. He is right. Teachers build the good parts of our economy. They give our children a chance. (Applause.) They give young people the skills that allow them to go out and find a good job or start a business or invent a product. Our plan would mean nearly 11,000 education jobs right here in Virginia. So I need all of you to tell the Senate: Put those teachers back to work. Put those teachers back to work. Pass the jobs bill and put those teachers back to work. (Applause.) But were not going to stop with that vote. Were going to have a few more votes. Well give the Senate a chance to vote on putting unemployed construction workers back on the job. Listen, I do not want China and Germany and other countries to build the newest roads and the newest bridges and the newest airports while ours are crumbling. Farmers can't get their products to market if weve got broken-down infrastructure. Businesses can't move their products and their people if weve got infrastructure that isnt state of the art. If we don't have the best airports, if we don't have the best roads, that will hurt our economy over the long term. Think about it. We are the United States of America. People used to travel from all around the world to look at what we built -- the Hoover Dam, Golden Gate Bridge, Grand Central Station, Interstate Highway System. Now people arent coming to see what we built because they're building it over there. So what we said was, well, the American Jobs Act, lets put those construction workers back to work. Lets rebuild and make sure our bridges are safe and our roads are safe and our airports are state of the art. (Applause.) The Senate will have an opportunity to vote on that bill. Then they're going to have a chance to vote on giving unemployed Americans the support they need to get back into the workforce and build a better life - because in this country, if youre willing to work hard, you should have the chance to get ahead. (Applause.) And then were going to ask the Senate to vote on a provision that says veterans -- if you are a small business and you hire a veteran, you should get a tax break -- because I don't want folks who have sacrificed halfway around the world for our safety to come back here and not be able to find a job. (Applause.) And then were going to ask the Senate to pay for it by making sure that folks like me are paying their fair share. (Applause.) And if Im paying my fair share, then you get a tax cut or a tax break. Small businesses get a tax cut. And I have to say theres been a lot of misleading information about this, so let me just be perfectly clear here. Let me be painfully clear. (Laughter.) Just in case anybody asks you about it, what we are proposing is that the payroll tax cut that we passed in December gets extended, gets expanded, and that will mean an extra $1,500 in your pocket compared to if we do nothing. If we dont pass this bill your taxes will go up by $1,000 -- AUDIENCE: Whew! THE PRESIDENT: -- for the average family. I know -- everybody says, I dont want that. (Laughter.) And to pay for it, people like me can afford to pay a little bit more. Now, understand, were talking about the top 1, 2 percent of people at the very top of the incomes scales. And we can afford it. We dont need a tax cut. We didnt ask for a tax break. You got corporations who are getting special deals on their tax codes. They dont need a special deal. Lets give a good deal to hardworking men and women who are out there struggling to make ends meet. (Applause.) So if anybody -- if you hear anybody saying, oh, Obamas plan, hes going to raise your taxes -- tell them, no, Im going to keep your taxes low for 97, 98 percent of the American people. For the top 1, 2 percent, youll go up a little bit, but you can afford it. (Applause.) You can afford it. A fair shot for everybody. A fair share from everybody. So those are the choices that the American people are going to have to face. And those are the choices that the members of Congress are going to have to face in the coming weeks. And if they vote against taking steps that we know will put people back to work, theyre not going to have to answer to me -- theyre going to have to answer to you. (Applause.) Theyre going to have to come down to Virginia and tell their kids why they cant have their teachers back. Theyre going to have to look those construction workers in the eye and say why we shouldn't rebuild America. Theyre going to have to explain to working families why their taxes are going up, while the taxes of well-to-do people keep on going down. So thats where you come in. I need your voices heard. I need you to give Congress a piece of your mind. Tell these members of Congress theyre supposed to be working for you -- (applause) -- not working for special interests, not working for campaign contributions. Theyre working for you, the American people. And they need to deliver, because theyre not delivering right now. (Applause.) You've got to get on the phone -- you got to get on the phone and write letters and pay visits and tweet -- (laughter) -- whatever you do, and remind your elected leaders to do the right thing. Tell them what's at stake. Remind them that No, we cant is not a good motto. ""No, we can't"" is not how we get through tough times. That's not how -- this is a country that's gone through a Revolutionary War. This is a country that's gone through a Civil War. This is a country that went through two World Wars, a Great Depression -- and we didn't just fold, we didn't just give up. Our grandparents, our great-grandparents, they didn't just say, ""No, we can't."" They didn't say, ""This is too hard."" They didn't say, ""We give up."" They didn't settle on the status quo. They rolled up their sleeves. They went after it. They said, ""America can do whatever we put our minds to when we are unified."" (Applause.) President Kennedy didnt look up at the moon and say Oh, that's too far! We can't go there. He said, ""We can make it."" And we did -- because that's the American spirit when it is unleashed. I know we've been going through tough times. But that's not an excuse for us to just sit back. That should be a motivation for us to try that much harder. (Applause.) There are too many of our fellow Americans who are hurting too bad for us to just sit by and do nothing. Now is the time for us to act. Now is the time for us to say, Yes, we can. (Applause.) We don't sit back and do nothing when things aren't right. We set our minds to it and we fix it. We make things work. We stick with it. And thats the spirit we've got to bring right now. So I just want to say to all of you, Virginia, I hope -- I hope and I pray that all of us can get together and stay focused on what it takes to continue to make this a great nation. (Applause.) I don't want us to be playing politics all the time. I want us to meet this moment. I want us to get to work. And I want us to show the world once again why the United States of America is the greatest nation on Earth. Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

22282,"No, We Cant? Or Wont?","Excuse No. 2: Fear the bond market. Two years ago The Wall Street Journal declared that interest rates on United States debt would soon soar unless Washington stopped trying to fight the economic slump. Ever since, warnings about the imminent attack of the bond vigilantes have been used to attack any spending on job creation. But basic economics said that rates would stay low as long as the economy was depressed  and basic economics was right. The interest rate on 10-year bonds was 3.7 percent when The Wall Street Journal issued that warning; at the end of last week it was 3.03 percent. How have the usual suspects responded? By inventing their own reality. Last week, Representative Paul Ryan, the man behind the G.O.P. plan to dismantle Medicare , declared that we must slash government spending to take pressure off the interest rates  the same pressure, I suppose, that has pushed those rates to near-record lows. Photo Excuse No. 3: Its the workers fault. Unemployment soared during the financial crisis and its aftermath. So it seems bizarre to argue that the real problem lies with the workers  that the millions of Americans who were working four years ago but arent working now somehow lack the skills the economy needs. Yet thats what you hear from many pundits these days: high unemployment is structural, they say, and requires long-term solutions (which means, in practice, doing nothing).

Well, if there really was a mismatch between the workers we have and the workers we need, workers who do have the right skills, and are therefore able to find jobs, should be getting big wage increases. They arent. In fact, average wages actually fell last month. Excuse No. 4: We tried to stimulate the economy, and it didnt work. Everybody knows that President Obama tried to stimulate the economy with a huge increase in government spending, and that it didnt work. But what everyone knows is wrong. Think about it: Where are the big public works projects? Where are the armies of government workers? There are actually half a million fewer government employees now than there were when Mr. Obama took office. Advertisement Continue reading the main story So what happened to the stimulus? Much of it consisted of tax cuts, not spending. Most of the rest consisted either of aid to distressed families or aid to hard-pressed state and local governments. This aid may have mitigated the slump, but it wasnt the kind of job-creation program we could and should have had. This isnt 20-20 hindsight: some of us warned from the beginning that tax cuts would be ineffective and that the proposed spending was woefully inadequate. And so it proved. Its also worth noting that in another area where government could make a big difference  help for troubled homeowners  almost nothing has been done. The Obama administrations program of mortgage relief has gone nowhere: of $46 billion allotted to help families stay in their homes, less than $2 billion has actually been spent. So lets summarize: The economy isnt fixing itself. Nor are there real obstacles to government action: both the bond vigilantes and structural unemployment exist only in the imaginations of pundits. And if stimulus seems to have failed, its because it was never actually tried. Listening to what supposedly serious people say about the economy, youd think the problem was no, we cant. But the reality is no, we wont.

22284,Allen and Kaine Campaign in Crozet on Foot and Horseback,"Two former governors are going head-to-head Saturday in some good old fashioned parade politicking. George Allen and Tim Kaine campaigned for support from voters in Crozet in the race for a US Senate seat in 2012. The two former governors had plenty of good things to say about Crozet, but also some tough words about the battles ahead in Washington. Democrat Tim Kaine shook hands as he walked the Crozet Avenue parade with fellow party members. Republican George Allen was a little further back in the line-up. And he didn't walk, Allen saddled up on a horse and rode the parade route. But both candidates are talking about the lack of compromise between congressional Republicans and President Obama over raising the debt ceiling. ""Tax increases would be the exact worst thing to do with this economy. My view is we ought to be reducing taxes on job creating businesses,"" said Allen. Kaine stated, ""The notion of just cutting spending means cutting veterans benefits and cutting social security and cutting medicare and medicaid. Those things wouldn't help the economy."" The president has said if a deal can't be reached by August 2 the nation would default on its loans, potentially crushing the economy. Both sides have vastly different views on how to create more jobs. Allen says we need more tax cuts, while Kaine maintains, it didn't work when Allen was governor and it won't work in Washington.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2011/jul/08/george-allen/allen-says-china-owns-more-us-bonds-americans/,Economy,Polifact
22310,That cookout will cost you 29% more this year,"The kabobs arent the only things getting skewered at this years Memorial Day barbecue. Hosts of the traditional holiday backyard cookout  even a budget affair  can expect to shell out an extra $45 for the fixings to serve a dozen. The souped-up total comes to $199, about 29 percent more than it cost last year  and that doesnt include soda, beer or booze. According to the latest inflation data for metro New York, food cost hikes are popping up just in time to spoil the annual holiday that marks the start of summer and salutes fallen heroes who helped make America the land of plenty. Gasolines 44 percent hike at the pumps this past year, along with similar diesel spikes, are squeezing industries and agriculture equally, said regional economist Martin Kohli of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Analysts said growers and food markets can no longer afford to soak up the rising costs and are passing them on to consumers at the fastest pace in several years. Since last Memorial Day, lettuce for that cookout hamburger has climbed 28 percent while a 20-cent ear of sweet corn on the cob is now 50 cents. Want tomatoes on that burger? Itll cost you 86 percent more than last year. Growers, meanwhile, are abandoning usual crops of grains and vegetables in favor of loading acres with corn for ethanol in gasoline blends. A record 43 percent of the US corn crop went into gas tanks in 2010, or about 810 billion pounds, with next years gas-tank crop forecast at 1 trillion pounds, said the US Department of Agriculture. Consumers have already cut back to make up for gas pump excesses, but cant exactly dodge the barbecue bubble with cheaper menus. The 29-percent jump in the cookout is based on a modest menu of ground beef burgers, ordinary franks, side dishes of potato salad, lettuce and tomatoes, and a dessert of supermarket ice cream. Coffee, which is up 20 percent, is included. Propane is 20 percent higher here and the price of gas at the pump to get you to the store to buy all the goodies  well, you know how much that costs these days. _EMAIL_",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/27/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-food-prices-barbecues-29-per/,Economy,Polifact
22348,Rule by Rentiers,"Of course, thats not the way what I call the Pain Caucus makes its case. Instead, the argument against helping the unemployed is framed in terms of economic risks: Do anything to create jobs and interest rates will soar, runaway inflation will break out, and so on. But these risks keep not materializing. Interest rates remain near historic lows, while inflation outside the price of oil  which is determined by world markets and events, not U.S. policy  remains low. Photo And against these hypothetical risks one must set the reality of an economy that remains deeply depressed, at great cost both to todays workers and to our nations future. After all, how can we expect to prosper two decades from now when millions of young graduates are, in effect, being denied the chance to get started on their careers? Ask for a coherent theory behind the abandonment of the unemployed and you wont get an answer. Instead, members of the Pain Caucus seem to be making it up as they go along, inventing ever-changing rationales for their never-changing policy prescriptions . While the ostensible reasons for inflicting pain keep changing, however, the policy prescriptions of the Pain Caucus all have one thing in common: They protect the interests of creditors, no matter the cost. Deficit spending could put the unemployed to work  but it might hurt the interests of existing bondholders. More aggressive action by the Fed could help boost us out of this slump  in fact, even Republican economists have argued that a bit of inflation might be exactly what the doctor ordered  but deflation , not inflation, serves the interests of creditors.

Not hard-working, thrifty small business owners and workers, although it serves the interests of the big players to pretend that its all about protecting little guys who play by the rules. The reality is that both small businesses and workers are hurt far more by the weak economy than they would be by, say, modest inflation that helps promote recovery. No, the only real beneficiaries of Pain Caucus policies (aside from the Chinese government) are the rentiers: bankers and wealthy individuals with lots of bonds in their portfolios. And that explains why creditor interests bulk so large in policy; not only is this the class that makes big campaign contributions, its the class that has personal access to policy makers  many of whom go to work for these people when they exit government through the revolving door. The process of influence doesnt have to involve raw corruption (although that happens, too). All it requires is the tendency to assume that whats good for the people you hang out with, the people who seem so impressive in meetings  hey, theyre rich, theyre smart, and they have great tailors  must be good for the economy as a whole. But the reality is just the opposite: creditor-friendly policies are crippling the economy.

22465,"Remarks by the President at a DNC Event in Austin, Texas","Austin, Texas Please see below for a correction (marked with asterisks) to the transcript. Internationally, weve gone through a **Teutonic [tectonic] shift in the Middle East that could have enormous ramifications for years to come. And in addition to these crises, we have had to grapple with some ongoing trends in this country that, frankly, have made America less competitive, less just, less equitable -- all the things that we talked about during the course of 2007 and 2008. May 10, 2011 7:18 P.M. CDT THE PRESIDENT: Let me, first of all -- I'd like to hire Alexa as my speechwriter. (Laughter.) I don't usually get such elegant introductions. And I'm so grateful to her and Blaine and the kids for opening up this gorgeous home. And I mentioned to Alexa that I do have a doctor with me at all times -- (laughter) -- so just in case the new one shows up early, we've got it under control. (Laughter.) We've got it under control. Hey, we're prepared for every situation. (Laughter.) To the hosts who helped to set this up, thank you so much. You guys have been great friends for a long time. And I was just at Austin City Limits, an extraordinary venue. And I told folks what is the truth, which is I just love Austin, Texas. (Applause.) I get a good vibe coming to Austin. So, post-presidency, if I decide to come back and theres not a strong candidate for mayor -- (laughter and applause) -- you never know. I'm a football fan, too. (Laughter.) I want to be brief because I want to spend as much time as possible answering questions, and then I want to come to each table and make sure I say thank you personally. Obviously we've had an eventful week, in an eventful month and an eventful couple of years. We knew when many of you got involved in the campaign back in 2008 that the country was at a crossroads and we were going to have to make some fairly consequential decisions to make sure that we were passing on a country that was worthy of its ideals. I don't think we fully realized how dramatic some of the changes would be as we came into office. We inherited the worst recession since the Great Depression, a banking system on the verge of meltdown. We had lost 4 million jobs by the time I was sworn in and would then lose another 4 million in the few months right after I was sworn in before our economic policies had a chance to take root. Internationally, weve gone through a **Teutonic [tectonic] shift in the Middle East that could have enormous ramifications for years to come. And in addition to these crises, we have had to grapple with some ongoing trends in this country that, frankly, have made America less competitive, less just, less equitable -- all the things that we talked about during the course of 2007 and 2008. Now, and I haven't even mentioned pirates -- (laughter) -- earthquakes and the H1N1 scare. So you guys have just forgotten all this stuff. (Laughter.) But I'm keeping a tally. (Laughter.) Despite crises large and small, whats been extraordinary is the progress that we've been able to make. And I could not be prouder of my team, but most importantly, I couldnt be prouder of my supporters whove hung in there during these very tumultuous times. But think about it. We saved the country from a Great Depression. An economy that was shrinking by about 6 percent in the first quarter that I came in is now growing fairly steadily. Over the last 14 months we've added over 2 million new jobs in the private sector here in the United States of America. Some things that folks thought would not work like saving the auto industry have worked. And so not only are the Big 3 automakers back all the workers that were about to be laid off. So that's about a million jobs saved all turning a profit, in some cases, the first profit theyve seen in a decade, but theyve now hired back all the workers that were about to be laid off. So that's about a million jobs saved just from those efforts on that front. We managed a banking crisis in a way that taxpayers are basically getting paid almost every dime back from the interventions that we entered into. Along the way we passed historic health care reform that had eluded us for a hundred years -- (applause) -- and we passed financial regulatory reform. We made sure that people who love their country can serve regardless of their sexual orientation by overturning ""don't ask, don't tell."" (Applause.) Got a couple of tough women on the Supreme Court, including the first Latina. (Applause.) We passed equal pay for equal work legislation. We made the largest investment in education in our history, but didnt just put more money in, initiating unprecedented reforms that are having ramifications all across the country. We made the largest investment in clean energy in our history, and have created entire new industries, like the advanced battery manufacturing industry here in the United States of America, where we look like we'll have close to a 40-percent share of the market in the next few years. Doubled our exports. Ended a war, as promised, and are working another war in a place where we're going to start drawing down our troops this year and are in a position to help Afghans secure their own country. So I'm realty proud of what we've gotten done. But we've got so much more to do. We have so much more to do. And in an era where everybody wants instant gratification and people are very, very impatient, the fact of the matter is that some of these changes are going to take time. Right now probably the thing that folks are most worried about around the country -- and rightfully so because it directly hinges on every aspect of our lives -- are gas prices. We don't have a silver bullet for gas prices. The way we're going to bring gas prices down is do some of the things that we've already done -- increasing fuel-efficiency standards on cars and trucks, and start developing new sources of energy and promoting electric vehicles. But its going to take some time. We're going to have to be able to sustain that effort over the next several years. Internationally, whats happening in the Middle East is a opportunity because, frankly, it was a very dangerous situation for us to rely on a handful of autocrats to maintain stability in the region. And now we have the possibility of democracy and opportunity, but there are also enormous dangers. And how that plays itself out is going to require steady leadership over the next several years. With respect to the economy, it is still changing in profound ways and the unemployment rate remains way too high. And the only way we are going to make sure that we drive that unemployment rate down, but more importantly, we start driving wages and incomes back up, is if the changes we're making in education, the changes that need to be made in terms of ensuring that we have an investment in innovation and basic research that allows us to maintain our cutting edge, making sure we get a handle on our deficit in a way that reflects our values -- that's going to take some time. Its going to require work. And so that's why your presence here tonight is so important, because the main thing I want to communicate to you is not only do I think we are going to win, but also I think that whats at stake is not just Democrats being in power versus Republicans; its not just a matter of winning or losing. Whats at stake is our ability to maintain a course that keeps us headed in the right direction for decades to come. Ill just focus on this budget issue just for one second, and then what I want to do is open it up for questions. When I came in I had sort of wrapped in a nice bow a trillion dollar deficit -- (laughter) -- welcoming me. And we had accumulated trillions of dollars of debt from the previous years. This had been building up over a decade as a consequence of the Bush tax cuts, two wars that weren't paid for, and a prescription drug plan that was very expensive but not paid for either. We then added about a trillion dollars as a consequence of reduced revenues and increased expenditures to make sure the states, for example, got help balancing their budgets, increased demand on things like unemployment insurance, and making sure that we were putting some folks back to work in this country. We now have to get our fiscal situation under control. The debate is not just about numbers. Its about who are we, what do we believe. And the debate that we're having now in Washington is actually very instructive and I'm glad we're having it, because Paul Ryan put forward a budget that is reflective, it is sort of the logical conclusion to the Republican argument that's been going on for a number of years. And essentially what theyre talking about is cutting education by 25 percent, cutting transportation spending by 30 percent, cutting clean energy investments by 70 percent, voucherizing Medicare, slashing Medicaid -- fundamentally reworking our social compact. And the consequences are not just that senior citizens would have $6,000 more in Medicare expenses every year. Its not just that a bunch of poor kids or seniors who are in nursing homes or families who have an autistic child would suddenly be without help. Even for those of us who are doing well, the consequences would be that -- let me just take the example of transportation. Think about cutting transportation spending by 30 percent, at a time when the National Association of Engineers gives us a D in infrastructure. We've got China and India and Europe building brand new trains and bridges and ports, and we can barely fill our potholes. And so the prospect would be a diminished, smaller, less compassionate America, and a less competitive America. And that's not the vision I want for our children. I think we're better than that. That's not who we are. And as I said at Austin City Limits, that's not because I'm particularly worried about how Malia or Sasha are going to do. Our kids will be fine. But what kind of country do we want them to live in? Do we want a country that has sort of the equivalent -- when it comes to our infrastructure, our social safety net, the equivalent of what used to be known as third world countries? How can we look them in the eye and tell them we're passing on to you the same kind of extraordinary country that we inherited when we are shrinking our vision, our sights, in that way? That's what this is about. That's what this election is going to be about. Now, its going to be tough because -- I think most people are not sold on the other folks ideas. They know they don't work. But theyre worried that we have not made as much progress as quickly as they want. And that always creates volatility when it comes to the electorate. But as I'm going around the country and talking to people, I can tell you the basic impulses of the American people, their values are strong, they are resilient, theyve got good instincts. And as long as we're able to get out there and deliver our message, I'm confident we're going to be able to see this thing through. Last weekend, obviously, Sunday was a big moment for the country, thanks to the extraordinary work of our men and women in uniform and our intelligence folks. And I visited Ground Zero, and some of you may have seen -- there were some young girls there who were standing behind me when I put the wreath down. One of the young ladies was 13. She had written me a letter on Monday, an email, that I received so I invited her to the ceremony. Her father had been in the Twin Towers when the planes hit them. And she was 4 years old at the time. And she remembers her mom picking up the phone on that spectacular September day, and suddenly starting to sob on the phone, and then her mother handing her the phone, and her father say, I love you and I'll always be looking after you. And then the phone went dead. And her mother and her witnessed the buildings go down and her father die. And she talked about how haunted she was by that memory, and described powerfully how sometimes she worries that she can't remember what her father looks like or the sound of his voice, and how much it meant that justice was done. And I think about her and when I met her, she couldn't have been more poised and charming and smart and ready for the future. And I thought, that's who we are. We take our licks, but we keep on going. And I want to make sure that our government is reflective of that. And I promise you I will make sure that our campaign is reflective of that spirit. And with all of your help, I'm confident that we're going to be able to keep on moving forward and deliver the kind of future for that young lady and all of our children and our grandchildren that they deserve. So thank you very much, everybody. (Applause.) END 7:35 P.M.

22475,Let's Harness American Energy To Lower Gas Prices And Create Jobs,"Like many Ohioans, I experienced sticker shock today when I filled up at our neighborhood gas station outside Cincinnati. Regular unleaded was $3.79 a gallon. Some Ohioans are already seeing gas prices over four dollars per gallon, and higher prices may be on the horizon. This makes it more expensive to commute, drive to the store or take a vacation. Because oil fuels every major sector of our economy, rising gas prices have a less visible, but no less costly, impact on all of us. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, 94 percent of all consumer goods and 68 percent of all farm goods are transported over Americas roads. As the cost of shipping and producing goods increases, we will find ourselves paying more for everything from groceries to electronics. Oil prices are on the rise for a host of reasons. As the global economy slowly recovers, demand for oil is rising to meet new manufacturing and other needs. The laws of supply and demand kick in. Unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, including oil-rich Libya, has also injected uncertainty into the energy markets, which results in price hikes. Some experts also suggest that the oil market is factoring in expected inflation due to global deficit spending, especially the record federal government debt in the United States. Still others point to the actions of speculators and their illegal actions driving up the cost of oil. The Obama Administration recently announced the formation of a new task force to look at fraud and manipulation within oil and energy markets. Any price fixing or other illegal activity should be prosecuted. But I don't think we need a task force to tell us what we need to do as a country to respond to yet another spike in oil prices: we need to move aggressively to get away from our dependence on foreign oil and this must include using more of our own resources. For decades, Washington, D.C. has been unwilling to tap the energy resources in our own backyard. This policy simply makes no sense in the worlds largest oil-consuming nation. The United States today consumes about 22 percent of the worlds oil supply  much of it from countries hostile to American interests and ideals. Last year alone, we spent $337 billion on oil imports, more than half of what we spent on our nations defense, and we have not been self-sufficient in energy production since 1970. There is a better way to power Americas economic future. What we need are common-sense solutions to strengthen U.S. energy production. That begins with harnessing the potential of our own natural resources in an environmentally responsible way. As an immediate bridge, we should increase access for oil exploration and production in energy-rich areas of the country like the Outer Continental Shelf, and in parts of Alaska. This will create jobs, drive investment, and immediately reduce our dangerous dependence on foreign oil. We must also look to alternatives to oil, recognizing that true innovation will come from private-sector entrepreneurs, engineers, and scientists  not from the Washington bureaucracy. Thats why it is critical to eliminate unnecessary rules and regulations that slow the development of cleaner, more affordable energy. Less red tape will free businesses to grow, innovate, and create new jobs. The good news is that Ohio is poised help lead Americas energy future. Ohio has a long history of producing its own energy sources, with an oil, gas, and coal business that pre-dates the Civil War. Today, Ohio is preparing for a natural gas shale revolution  a new means of tapping energy-rich underground rock formations. Considering the potential of the Marcellus and Utica Shale Formations, we have the possibility of creating good Ohio jobs while providing Ohioans with access to large quantities of cleaner-burning natural gas that can be used today for buses, taxis and other fleets and could be used for cars in the future. Where natural gas is used for transportation fuel today, the average cost per gallon is less than $2.00. These new breakthroughs in Ohio energy production can build on the longstanding strength of our Ohio coal industry. Coal is a proven source of relatively inexpensive energy that supports thousands of jobs across Ohio. Clean coal technology continues to develop, and, with the help of research being done at Ohio's Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, coal-to-liquid could become another affordable domestic alternative to oil. Ohio also continues to be a leading producer of bio-fuels. We currently have five operating plants, producing 424 million gallons of ethanol annually and contributing hundreds of jobs and millions of dollars of economic activity to Ohios rural economy. Research and new cellulosic ethanol technologies are making home-grown Ohio bio-fuels more cost-effective and should be encouraged through further research and investments. Ohio is also a leader on fuel cell research and other clean technologies to power the cars of the future. As these examples show, America has the know-how and the natural abundance to move toward a future of energy independence. But we must make the right choices today. It is time to unleash the ingenuity of our workforce and the potential of our energy resources to power the American economy and create new jobs  with Ohio leading the way.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2011/may/04/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-easing-access-drilling-would-/,Economy,Polifact
22508,Tea Party: Cut Spending Before Raising Debt,"Freshmen congressional members of the Tea Party say they will not vote to raise the debt ceiling without guaranteed structural changes to spending levels.

""It's going to have to be a lot more than just sweetening it. It's going to have to be concrete."" Fears about catastrophic consequences, like those described by Treasury secretary Timothy Geithner in an interview on ""This Week,"" should not drive the debt ceiling vote, according to Representative Allen West,R-Fla. ""I don't believe in leadership by fear and intimidation. I think that leaders have to come up with viable solutions,"" said West, who advocated for reducing corporate tax rates to spur growth and a trigger mechanism for automatic spending cuts, which President Obama also proposed last week.

""Medicare is an issue that we absolutely have to deal with,"" said Ellmers, who is a nurse. ""If we do not address Medicare as it is, it will not be there for myself, it will not be there for our children or our grandchildren.""

22608,Florida Governor Scott to Help Share a Little Sunshine,"Leads team of Sunshine Ambassadors on four-city tour to invite winter-weary northerners to the Sunshine State Feb 28 2011; Tallahassee, FL  After a brutally harsh winter for many Americans, Florida Governor Rick Scott and VISIT FLORIDA, the states official tourism marketing corporation, have organized the Share a Little Sunshine Tour to invite those hit hardest by this years unseasonably cold weather to defrost in sunny Florida. Governor Scott and the rest of the Sunshine Ambassadors will start their two-day tour March 1 in Orlando and make stops in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, New York City and Chicago. When the whirlwind tour ends in the Windy City, 120 lucky winners will board a chartered plane and return to Orlando with the Governor to take a much-needed break from the worst winter many have seen in decades. Jobs and economic development are two of the most important issues we face as a state and a nation, said Florida Governor Rick Scott. Tourism is an important economic engine for Florida and employs nearly one million residents, I am proud to lead VISIT FLORIDAs Share a Little Sunshine campaign to bring more visitors to the Sunshine State. We know that every 85 visitors create one Florida job, so I urge all Floridians to join with me in supporting this effort to increase jobs and grow the states economy. Residents and fans can be part of the Share a Little Sunshine campaign by visiting ShareALittleSunshine.org to send a personalized e-postcard inviting someone to Florida. They can also post photos and comments, find Sunshine Deals and share Florida travel information by joining the nearly 25,000 followers of Share a Little Sunshine on Facebook at facebook.com/FloridaSunshine. As the No. 1 industry in the state, tourism is big business in Florida  there are more people visiting the Sunshine State on any given day than live in twelve U.S. states. In fact, tourism is so significant that it generates more than one fifth of the states sales tax revenue. We are grateful that the Governor continues to acknowledge the importance of tourism to the states economy by participating in this fast-paced, fun-filled tour of several of Floridas key visitor markets, said Ed Fouch, Chairman of the VISIT FLORIDA Board of Directors and Senior Vice PresidentTravel Industry Sales for Disney Destinations. The tour begins on March 1 at 8:30 a.m. with a rally at the UCF Rosen College of Hospitality Management in Orlando. The public is invited to attend the event where Governor Scott, VISIT FLORIDA, Visit Orlando, the Partnership for Floridas Tourism and others will be encouraging residents to participate in VISIT FLORIDAs Share a Little Sunshine program by sending personal invitations to their out-of-state friends and family to visit the Sunshine State. The rally will conclude with a send-off for Governor Scott, who will lead the charge as the team takes off for its first stop in Washington, D.C., speaking to potential visitors and awarding great Florida vacation prizes along the way. The Share a Little Sunshine campaign was created as a fun, easy way for residents to invite friends and family to Florida, and having Governor Scott take time to extend a personal invitation to everyone he meets on this tour to visit the Sunshine State takes the program to a whole new level, said Chris Thompson, President and CEO of VISIT FLORIDA. We know this has been an extremely difficult winter for many around the country, so were happy to be sharing a little sunshine with our neighbors to the north. Throughout the two-day tour, Governor Scott and the rest of the Sunshine State squad will be hosting special events and giving away Florida vacation packages to promotion winners. The tour concludes on March 2 at Midway Airport in Chicago as the Governor escorts a plane full of prize winners who will depart that evening for a four-day stay in Orlando. Southwest Airlines, Walt Disney World and dozens of other VISIT FLORIDA partners have come together to help create the vacation packages being given away to winners in each market. So many organizations have come together to help VISIT FLORIDA make this tour a reality, said Will Seccombe, Chief Marketing Officer for VISIT FLORIDA. I would especially like to thank our Florida tourism industry partners and trade associations, without whose efforts this event would not have been possible. ### En Espaol",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2011/mar/10/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-says-every-85-tourists-one-job-crea/,Economy,Polifact
22685,Full text: Mitch Daniels speech to CPAC,"Full text: Mitch Daniels speech to CPAC 3:25 AM 02/12/2011 | Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels February 11, 2011 Remarks Ronald Reagan Centennial Dinner Conservative Political Action Conference Washington, D.C. Phyllis Schlafly, David Keene, George Will, good friends, thank you for the enormous privilege of this podium. Even a casual observer of American public life knows how many great ideas have been born here, how many important debates joined here, how many giants of our democracy appeared on this platform. When David broached the invitation, my first reaction was one I often have: Who cancelled? But first choice or fifteenth, the honor, and the responsibility to do the occasion justice, is the same. I am seized with the sentiment best expressed by Hizzoner, the original Mayor Richard Daley, who once proclaimed a similar honor the pinochle of success. We are all grateful to our co-sponsors, the Reagan Foundation and the Reagan Ranch. How fitting that we convene under their auspices, as we close this first week of the centennial. Those of us who served President Reagan were taught to show constant respect for the presidency and whoever occupies it. But, among us alums, the term the President tends to connote just one of those forty-four men, that great man with whom God blessed America one hundred years ago this week. The prefix in co-sponsor is meaningful tonight. It is no state secret that the two foundations have not always been co-operative, or co-llaborative, or co-llegial. So it is a tribute to the stature and diplomacy of David Keene that they have come together to produce so warm a moment as this. I am now converted to the view that yes, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will be solved. Well done, David; Nobel Peace Prizes have been awarded for far less. I bring greetings from a place called Indiana. The coastal types present may think of it as a flyover state, or one of those I states. Perhaps a quick anthropological summary would help. We Hoosiers hold to some quaint notions. Some might say we cling to them, though not out of fear or ignorance. We believe in paying our bills. We have kept our state in the black throughout the recent unpleasantness, while cutting rather than raising taxes, by practicing an old tribal ritual  we spend less money than we take in. We believe it wrong ever to take a dollar from a free citizen without a very necessary public purpose, because each such taking diminishes the freedom to spend that dollar as its owner would prefer. When we do find it necessary, we feel a profound duty to use that dollar as carefully and effectively as possible, else we should never have taken it at all. Before our General Assembly now is my proposal for an automatic refund of tax dollars beyond a specified level of state reserves. We say that anytime budgets are balanced and an ample savings account has been set aside, government should just stop collecting taxes. Better to leave that money in the pockets of those who earned it, than to let it burn a hole, as it always does, in the pockets of government. We believe that government works for the benefit of private life, and not the other way around. We see governments mission as fostering and enabling the important realms  our businesses, service clubs, Little Leagues, churches  to flourish. Our first thought is always for those on lifes first rung, and how we might increase their chances of climbing. Every day, we work to lower the costs and barriers to free men and women creating wealth for each other. We build roads, and bridges, and new sources of homegrown energy at record rates, in order to have the strongest possible backbone to which people of enterprise can attach their investments and build their dreams. When business leaders ask me what they can do for Indiana, I always reply: Make money. Go make money. Thats the first act of corporate citizenship. If you do that, youll have to hire someone else, and youll have enough profit to help one of those non-profits were so proud of. We place our trust in average people. We are confident in their ability to decide wisely for themselves, on the important matters of their lives. So when we cut property taxes, to the lowest level in America, we left flexibility for localities to raise them, but only by securing the permission of their taxpayers, voting in referendum. We designed both our state employee health plans and the one we created for low-income Hoosiers as Health Savings Accounts, and now in the tens of thousands these citizens are proving that they are fully capable of making smart, consumerist choices about their own health care. We have broadened the right of parents to select the best place for their childrens education to include every public school, traditional or charter, regardless of geography, tuition-free. And before our current legislature adjourns, we intend to become the first state of full and true choice by saying to every low and middle-income Hoosier family, if you think a non-government school is the right one for your child, youre as entitled to that option as any wealthy family; heres a voucher, go sign up. Lastly, speaking now for my administration colleagues, we believe in government that is limited but active. Within that narrow sphere of legitimate collective action, we choose to be the initiators of new ideas or, as we have labeled ourselves, the Party of Purpose. In President Reagans phrase, We are the change. On election nights, we remind each other that victory is not a vindication, it is an instruction, not an endorsement, but an assignment. The national elections of 2010 carried an instruction. In our nation, in our time, the friends of freedom have an assignment, as great as those of the 1860s, or the 1940s, or the long twilight of the Cold War. As in those days, the American project is menaced by a survival-level threat. We face an enemy, lethal to liberty, and even more implacable than those America has defeated before. We cannot deter it; there is no countervailing danger we can pose. We cannot negotiate with it, any more than with an iceberg or a Great White. I refer, of course, to the debts our nation has amassed for itself over decades of indulgence. It is the new Red Menace, this time consisting of ink. We can debate its origins endlessly and search for villains on ideological grounds, but the reality is pure arithmetic. No enterprise, small or large, public or private, can remain self-governing, let alone successful, so deeply in hock to others as we are about to be. Need I illustrate? Surely the consequences, to prosperity, world influence, and personal freedom itself are as clear to this audience as to any one could appear before. Do I exaggerate? Id love to be shown that I do. Any who think so please see me in the hallway afterward, and bring your third grade math books. If a foreign power advanced an army to the border of our land, everyone in this room would drop everything and look for a way to help. We would set aside all other agendas and disputes as secondary, and go to the ramparts until the threat was repelled. That is what those of us here, and every possible ally we can persuade to join us, are now called to do. It is our generational assignment. It is the mission of our era. Forgive the pun when I call it our raison debt. Every conflict has its draft dodgers. There are those who will not enlist with us. Some who can accept, or even welcome, the ballooning of the state, regardless of the cost in dollars, opportunity, or liberty, and the slippage of the United States into a gray parity with the other nations of this earth. Some who sincerely believe that history has devised a leftward ratchet, moving in fits and starts but always in the direction of a more powerful state. The people who coined the smug and infuriating term  have you heard it?  the Reagan Interruption. The task of such people is now a simple one. They need only play good defense. The federal spending commitments now in place will bring about the leviathan state they have always sought. The health care travesty now on the books will engulf private markets and produce a single-payer system or its equivalent, and it wont take long to happen. Our fiscal ruin and resulting loss of world leadership will, in their eyes, be not a tragic event but a desirable one, delivering the multilateral world of which theyve dreamed so long. Fortunately, these folks remain few. They are vastly outnumbered by Americans who sense the presence of the enemy, but are awaiting the call for volunteers, and a credible battle plan for saving our Republic. That call must come from this room, and rooms like it. But we, too, are relatively few in number, in a nation of 300 million. If freedoms best friends cannot unify around a realistic, actionable program of fundamental change, one that attracts and persuades a broad majority of our fellow citizens, big change will not come. Or rather, big change will come, of the kind that the skeptics of all centuries have predicted for those nave societies that believed that government of and by the people could long endure. We know what the basic elements must be. An affectionate thank you to the major social welfare programs of the last century, but their sunsetting when those currently or soon to be enrolled have passed off the scene. The creation of new Social Security and Medicare compacts with the young people who will pay for their elders and who deserve to have a backstop available to them in their own retirement. These programs should reserve their funds for those most in need of them. They should be updated to catch up to Americans increasing longevity and good health. They should protect benefits against inflation but not overprotect them. Medicare 2.0 should restore to the next generation the dignity of making their own decisions, by delivering its dollars directly to the individual, based on financial and medical need, entrusting and empowering citizens to choose their own insurance and, inevitably, pay for more of their routine care like the discerning, autonomous consumers we know them to be. Our morbidly obese federal government needs not just behavior modification but bariatric surgery. The perverse presumption that places the burden of proof on the challenger of spending must be inverted, back to the rule that applies elsewhere in life: Prove to me why we should. Lost to history is the fact that, in my OMB assignment, I was the first loud critic of Congressional earmarks. I was also the first to get absolutely nowhere in reducing them: first to rail and first to fail. They are a pernicious practice and should be stopped. But, in the cause of national solvency, they are a trifle. Talking much more about them, or waste, fraud, and abuse, trivializes what needs to be done, and misleads our fellow citizens to believe that easy answers are available to us. In this room, we all know how hard the answers are, how much change is required. And that means nothing, not even the first and most important mission of government, our national defense, can get a free pass. I served in two administrations that practiced and validated the policy of peace through strength. It has served America and the world with irrefutable success. But if our nation goes over a financial Niagara, we wont have much strength and, eventually, we wont have peace. We are currently borrowing the entire defense budget from foreign investors. Within a few years, we will be spending more on interest payments than on national security. That is not, as our military friends say, a robust strategy. I personally favor restoring impoundment power to the presidency, at least on an emergency basis. Having had this authority the last six years, and used it shall we say with vigor, I can testify to its effectiveness, and to this finding: Youd be amazed how much government youll never miss. The nation must be summoned to General Quarters in the cause of economic growth. The friends of freedom always favor a growing economy as the wellspring of individual opportunity and a bulwark against a domineering state. But here, doctrinal debates are unnecessary; the arithmetic tells it all. We dont have a prayer of defeating the Red Threat of our generation without a long boom of almost unprecedented duration. Every other goal, however worthy, must be tested against and often subordinated to actions that spur the faster expansion of the private sector on which all else depends. A friend of mine attended a recent meeting of the NBA leadership, at which a small-market owner, whom I wont name but will mention is also a member of the U.S. Senate, made an impassioned plea for more sharing of revenue by the more successful teams. At a coffee break, Mr. Prokhorov, the new Russian owner of the New Jersey Nets, murmured to my friend, We tried that, you know. It doesnt work. Americans have seen these last two years what doesnt work. The failure of national economic policy is costing us more than jobs; it has begun to weaken that uniquely American spirit of risk-taking, large ambition, and optimism about the future. We must rally them now to bold departures that rebuild our national morale as well as our material prosperity. Here, too, the room abounds with experts and good ideas, and the nation will need every one. Just to name three: its time we had, in Bill Simons words a tax system that looks like someone designed it on purpose. And the purpose should be private growth. So lower and flatter, and completely flat is best. Tax compensation but not the savings and investment without which the economy cannot boom. Second, untie Gulliver. The regulatory rainforest through which our enterprises must hack their way is blighting the future of millions of Americans. Todays EPA should be renamed the Employment Prevention Agency. After a two-year orgy of new regulation, President Obamas recent executive order was a wonderment, as though the number one producer of rap music had suddenly expressed alarm about obscenity. In Indiana, where our privatization of a toll road generated billions for reinvestment in infrastructure, we can build in half the time at two-thirds the cost when we use our own money only and are free from the federal rulebook. A moratorium on new regulation is a minimal suggestion; better yet, move at least temporarily to a self-certification regime that lets America build, and expand, and explore now and settle up later in those few instances where someone colors outside the lines. Finally, treat domestic energy production as the economic necessity it is and the job creator it can be. Drill, and frack, and lease, and license, unleash in every way the jobs potential in the enormous energy resources we have been denying ourselves. And help our fellow citizens to understand that a poorer country will not be a greener country, but its opposite. It is freedom and its fruits that enable the steady progress we have made in preserving and protecting Gods kingdom. If this strikes you as a project of unusual ambition, given the state of modern politics, you are right. If it strikes you as too bold for our fellow Americans to embrace, I believe you are wrong. Seven years as a practitioner in elective politics tells me that historys skeptics are wrong. That Americans, in a vast majority, are still a people born for self-governance. They are ready to summon the discipline to pay down our collective debts as they are now paying down their own; to put the future before the present, their childrens interest before their own. Our proposals will be labeled radical, but this is easy to rebut. Starting a new retirement plan for those below a certain age is something tens of millions of Americans have already been through at work. Opponents will expect us to be defensive, but they have it backwards. When they call the slightest spending reductions painful, we will say If government spending prevents pain, why are we suffering so much of it? And If you want to experience real pain, just stay on the track we are on. When they attack us for our social welfare reforms, we will say that the true enemies of Social Security and Medicare are those who defend an imploding status quo, and the arithmetic backs us up. They will attack our program as the way of despair, but we will say no, Americas way forward is brilliant with hope, as soon as we have dealt decisively with the manageable problems before us. 2010 showed that the spirit of liberty and independence is stirring anew, that a growing number of Americans still hear Lincolns mystic chords of memory. But their number will have to grow, and do so swiftly. Change of the dimension we need requires a coalition of a dimension no one has recently assembled. And, unless you disbelieve what the arithmetic of disaster is telling us, time is very short. Here I wish to be very plainspoken: It is up to us to show, specifically, the best way back to greatness, and to argue for it with all the passion of our patriotism. But, should the best way be blocked, while the enemy draws nearer, then someone will need to find the second best way. Or the third, because the nations survival requires it. Purity in martyrdom is for suicide bombers. King Pyrrhus is remembered, but his nation disappeared. Winston Churchill set aside his lifetime loathing of Communism in order to fight World War II. Challenged as a hypocrite, he said that when the safety of Britain was at stake, his conscience became a good girl. We are at such a moment. I for one have no interest in standing in the wreckage of our Republic saying I told you so or You shouldve done it my way. We must be the vanguard of recovery, but we cannot do it alone. We have learned in Indiana, big change requires big majorities. We will need people who never tune in to Rush or Glenn or Laura or Sean. Who surf past C-SPAN to get to SportsCenter. Who, if theyd ever heard of CPAC, would assume it was a cruise ship accessory. The second worst outcome I can imagine for next year would be to lose to the current president and subject the nation to what might be a fatal last dose of statism. The worst would be to win the election and then prove ourselves incapable of turning the ship of state before it went on the rocks, with us at the helm. So we must unify America, or enough of it, to demand and sustain the Big Change we propose. Here are a few suggestions: We must display a heart for every American, and a special passion for those still on the first rung of lifes ladder. Upward mobility from the bottom is the crux of the American promise, and the stagnation of the middle class is in fact becoming a problem, on any fair reading of the facts. Our main task is not to see that people of great wealth add to it, but that those without much money have a greater chance to earn some. We should address ourselves to young America at every opportunity. It is their futures that todays policies endanger, and in their direct interest that we propose a new direction. We should distinguish carefully skepticism about Big Government from contempt for all government. After all, it is a new government we hope to form, a government we will ask our fellow citizens to trust to make huge changes. I urge a similar thoughtfulness about the rhetoric we deploy in the great debate ahead. I suspect everyone here regrets and laments the sad, crude coarsening of our popular culture. It has a counterpart in the venomous, petty, often ad hominem political discourse of the day. When one of us  I confess sometimes it was yours truly  got a little hotheaded, President Reagan would admonish us, Remember, we have no enemies, only opponents. Good advice, then and now. And besides, our opponents are better at nastiness than we will ever be. It comes naturally. Power to them is everything, so theres nothing they wont say to get it. The public is increasingly disgusted with a steady diet of defamation, and prepared to reward those who refrain from it. Am I alone in observing that one of conservatisms best moments this past year was a massive rally that came and went from Washington without leaving any trash, physical or rhetorical, behind? A more affirmative, better angels approach to voters is really less an aesthetic than a practical one: with apologies for the banality, I submit that, as we ask Americans to join us on such a boldly different course, it would help if they liked us, just a bit. Lastly, critically, I urge great care not to drift into a loss of faith in the American people. In speech after speech, article upon article, we remind each other how many are dependent on government, or how few pay taxes, or how much essential virtues like family formation or civic education have withered. All true. All worrisome. But we must never yield to the self-fulfilling despair that these problems are immutable, or insurmountable. All great enterprises have a pearl of faith at their core, and this must be ours: that Americans are still a people born to liberty. That they retain the capacity for self-government. That, addressed as free-born, autonomous men and women of God-given dignity, they will rise yet again to drive back a mortal enemy. Historys assignment to this generation of freedom fighters is in one way even more profound than the tests of our proud past. We are tasked to rebuild not just a damaged economy, and a debt-ridden balance sheet, but to do so by drawing forth the best that is in our fellow citizens. If we would summon the best from Americans, we must assume the best about them. If we dont believe in Americans, who will? I do believe. Ive seen it in the people of our very typical corner of the nation. Ive seen it in the hundred Indiana homes in which I have stayed overnight. Ive seen it in Hoosiers resolute support of limited government, their willingness, even insistence, that government keep within the boundaries our constitutional surveyors mapped out for it. Ive always loved John Adams diary entry, written en route to Philadelphia, there to put his life, liberty, and sacred honor all at risk. He wrote that it was all well worth it because, he said, Great things are wanted to be done. When he and his colleagues arrived, and over the years ahead, they practiced the art of the possible. They made compacts and concessions and, yes, compromises. They made deep sectional and other differences secondary in pursuit of the grand prize of freedom. They each argued passionately for the best answers as they saw them, but they never permitted the perfect to be the enemy of the historic good they did for us, and all mankind. They gave us a Republic, citizen Franklin said, if we can keep it. Keeping the Republic is the great thing that is wanted to be done, now, in our time, by us. In this room are convened freedoms best friends but, to keep our Republic, freedom needs every friend it can get. Lets go find them, and befriend them, and welcome them to the great thing that is wanted to be done in our day.

22714,Romney CPAC Speech: It's All About the Jobs,"Fox News has obtained the prepared text of Mitt Romney's upcoming speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference. From what we see here, Romney's speech is all about the jobs, even referring to ""Obama's Misery Index."" Also of note is the ""Believe in America"" theme that Romney first sounded out in the introduction to the paperback version of his book ""No Apology: The Case For American Greatness."" In a bit of straw poll campaigning the ""Believe in America"" slogan is also on bumper stickers, lapel stickers and signs seen throughout the conference. Romney's wife Ann will introduce the former Massaschusetts governor. Here is the text of the speech: I've been in Ann's shadow ever since our first date in high school. Over our years together, she's waged some pretty impressive battles. Among her many accomplishments, none is more important or rewarding-to us and to our country-than her accomplishment as a successful mother of 5 and grandmother of 16. Thank you, Ann. The other night, from opposite coasts of the country, Ann and I watched President Obama's State of the Union address. Ann figured out pretty fast what was going on. She sent me an email saying that it sounded like he was reading my CPAC speech from last year. What we were hearing was not just a new and improved Barack Obama; it was an entirely different Barack Obama. Saul Alinsky was out; Jeffrey Immelt was in. The President went from ""Change you can believe in"" to ""Can you believe this change?"" He sounded like he was going to dig up the First Lady's organic garden to put in a Bob's Big Boy. But as the speech went on, it was clear that this was just the appearance of change: His answer for Americans out of work was more government spending and $50 billion for high speed rail. He replaced his Chicago politician chief of staff with a fresh face from Chicago, named Daley. Make no mistake: What we are watching is not Brave New World; what we're watching is Groundhog Day! Two years ago, this new President faced an economic crisis and an increasingly uncertain world. An uncertain world has been made more dangerous by the lack of clear direction from a weak President. The President who touted his personal experience as giving him special insight into foreign affairs was caught unprepared when Iranian citizens rose up against oppression. His proposed policy of engagement with Iran and North Korea won him the Nobel Peace Prize. How's that worked out? Iran armed Hezbollah and Hamas and is rushing toward nuclear weapons. North Korea fired missiles, tested nukes, sunk a South Korean ship and shelled a South Korean island. And his ""reset program"" with Russia? That consisted of our President abandoning our missile defense in Poland and signing a one-sided nuclear treaty. The cause of liberty cannot endure much more of his ""they get, we give"" diplomacy! The world - and our valiant troops - watched in confusion as the President announced that he intended to win the war in Afghanistan....as long as it didn't go much beyond August of 2011. And while the Taliban may not have an air force or sophisticated drones, it's safe to say... they do have calendars. I surely hope that at some point in the near future, the President will finally be able to construct a foreign policy, any foreign policy. Here at home, the President's response to the economic crisis was the most expensive failed social experiment in modern history. He guaranteed that unemployment wouldn't go beyond 8%. As he watched millions and millions of Americans lose their jobs, lose their homes and lose their hope, his response was this: It could be worse. It could be worse? This is the leader of the Free World's answer to the greatest job loss since the Great Depression? What's next? Let them eat cake? Oh, excuse me. Organic cake. It's often said that the Presidency of the United States is the toughest job in the world. Fair enough. Undoubtedly true. But how difficult is it to take office in the middle of a raging economic crisis and understand that the economy should be your number one priority? The President who took office on January 20th, 2009 should have had one central mission - put Americans back to work! Fight for every job! Because every job is a paycheck and paychecks fuel Americans dreams. Without a paycheck, you can't take care of your family. Without a paycheck you can't buy school books for your kids, keep a car on the road or help an aging parent make ends meet. President Barack Obama has stood watch over the greatest job loss in modern American history. And that, my friends, is one inconvenient truth that will haunt this President throughout history. Today there are more men and women out of work in America than there are people working in Canada. And in the month of January, Canada created more new jobs than we did. When Ronald Reagan ran for President, he hung the Misery Index around Jimmy Carter's neck. Today's misery is real unemployment, home foreclosures and bankruptcies. This is the Obama Misery Index-and it's at a record high. It's going to take more than new rhetoric to put Americans back to work-it's going to take a new president. Let me make this very clear. If I decide to run for President, it won't take me two years to wake up to the job crisis threatening America. And I won't be asking Tim Geithner how the economy works-or Larry Summers how to start a business. Fifteen million Americans are out of work. And millions and millions more can't find the good paying jobs they long for and deserve. You've seen the heartbreaking photos and videos of the jobs fairs around the country, where thousands show up to stand in line all day just to have a chance to compete for a few job openings that probably aren't as good as the job they held two years ago. These job fairs and unemployment lines are President Obama's Hoovervilles. Make no mistake. This is a moral tragedy-a moral tragedy of epic proportion. Unemployment is not just a statistic. Fifteen million unemployed is not just a number. Unemployment means kids can't go to college; that marriages break up under the financial strain; that young people can't find work and start their lives; and men and women in their 50s, in the prime of their lives, fear they will never find a job again. Liberals should be ashamed that they and their policies have failed these good and decent Americans! The President is trying to show that he finally gets it-that he really isn't a liberal after all. But his idea of conservative economic policy is to invite some corporate CEO's to the White House for an evening of table-talk. I'm sorry Mr. President, but that's not a policy, it's a dinner party. We've seen the failure of liberal answers before. Liberal welfare policies condemned generations to dependency and poverty. Liberal education policies fail our children today, because they put pensions and privilege for union bosses above the reading scores of our kids. Liberal social policies have failed to protect the unborn. And now, the hollow promises of liberal economic policies have failed to provide millions of Americans with the dignity of work. Under the pressure of a crisis, people turn to what they really believe. With our economy in crisis, the President and his fellow liberals turned to Europe for their answers. Like the Europeans, they grew the government, they racked up bigger deficits, they took over healthcare, they pushed cap and trade, they stalled production of our oil and gas and coal, they fought to impose unions on America's workers, and they created over a hundred new agencies and commissions and hundreds of thousands of pages of new regulations. Theirs is a European-style solution to an American problem. It does not work there and it will never work here! The right answer is not to believe in European solutions. The right answer is to believe in America-to believe in free enterprise, capitalism, limited government, federalism-and to believe in the constitution, as it was written and intended by the founders. My father never graduated from college. He apprenticed as a lath and plaster carpenter, and he was darn good at it. He learned how to put a handful of nails in his mouth and spit them out, point forward. On his honeymoon, he and Mom drove across the country. Dad sold aluminum paint along the way, to pay for gas and hotels. Dad always believed in America; and in that America, a lath and plaster man could work his way up to running a little car company called American Motors and end up Governor of a state where he had once sold aluminum paint. For my Dad, America was the land of opportunity, where free enterprise, small business and entrepreneurs were encouraged and respected. The spirit of enterprise propelled America's economy and our standard of living past every other nation on earth. I refuse to believe that America is just another place on the map with a flag. I believe that America is an exceptional nation, of freedom and opportunity and hope. The America I believe in has goodness and a greatness that creates a unique American genius. That genius has blessed the world, led the world and yes, even saved the world from unimaginable darkness. We didn't originate the concept of liberty but our Founding Fathers redefined it and shared it with the world. From the brilliant sands of Omaha beach to the dark valleys of the Hindu Kush, we have fought with an unmatched courage and determination, not to conquer territory, but to give others the chance to experience the liberty that is humanity's destiny. Given all that America has done to lift others from poverty, given the millions of afflicted we have helped to heal and comfort, and given the hundreds of thousands of lives of America's sons and daughters that have been, and are today, sacrificed to defend freedom, I will not apologize for America! I don't apologize for America because I believe in America! We believe in freedom, in opportunity. We believe in free enterprise and capitalism. We believe in the American dream. And we believe that the principles that made America the leader of the world today are the very principles that will keep America the leader of the world tomorrow. These last two years have not been the best of times. But while we've lost a couple of years, we have not lost our way. This is fundamentally what conservatism is all about. We sing for God to bless America. He already has, he does now and thanks to the greatness of the American people and the principles that guide us, he will do so for generations to come. Believe in America. Freedom depends on it. Thank you.

22721,General Motors Debt,"Q: Did General Motors repay its TARP loan from the Treasury with other TARP money? A: Yes. GM repaid the loan portion of the automaker bailout ahead of schedule, with interest. It used TARP money it had already received but hadnt spent. And taxpayers are still stuck with GM stock that isnt worth what was paid for it. FULL QUESTION There are GM commercials and mass mailings that say theyve paid back their ""government loans"" ahead of schedule with interest. Didnt the government take a 71% ownership in the company? Was that a loan or is the loan a smoke screen for the actual government ownership? Has GM repaid its bailout loan in full with interest, 5 years ahead of schedule? GM is running advertisements claiming the above statement is true, and the President seemed to reaffirm that claim in his most recent radio address. However, Sen. Grassely (R) claims that GM is using other bailout funds in order to pay off the aforementioned bailout funds and their claim is simply an accounting trick. FULL ANSWER Many readers have asked us about the White House-touted news that General Motors, and Chrysler, repaid loan money from the Treasury Department, with interest, ahead of schedule. GM launched an ad boasting of the news, and President Obama talked about it in his weekly address on April 24. We wrote about this, too, on April 26 in a review of the Sunday political talk shows. Heres the deal for those who missed that post: Yes, its true that GM paid back its loan from the Treasury Department, in full, ahead of schedule. But the debt was only part of the automaker bailout package. Through the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the Treasury gave GM $49.5 billion, most of which was converted into an ownership stake in the form of stock. Through this equity stake, the government still owns 61 percent of GM. Some Republicans, including Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa have pointed out that GM used TARP money to pay back its TARP debt. Thats true, but GM simply handed back TARP money it had been lent and hadnt used. Those funds had been sitting in an escrow account, should the automaker need them. (The company didnt borrow new money to pay back an older loan.) Grassley has argued that this wasnt a ""meaningful"" repayment of a loan, since it didnt come from earnings. Thats an opinion, and well leave it to readers to agree or disagree with the senator. The TARP special inspector general, Neil Barofsky, has said the repayment was ""good news,"" since it meant the automaker didnt need to use those funds held in escrow. In testimony before the Senate Finance Committee on April 20, Barofksy made it clear GM still was operating with government help: Barofsky, April 20: G.M. has paid $1 billion, and I think theyve announced that theyre going to be paying back the debt portion, which is about  I think theres about $6 billion left in its entirety very shortly. But we should be a little  we need to be a little bit cautious about that because the way that that payments going to be made is drawing down an equity facility of other TARP money. So its good news in that theyre reducing their debt, but theyre using it by taking other available TARP money to repay the TARP. Its good news because it means that money, which was going to be available for future problems with G.M., that theres a determination that they dont need it, but we should caution that its not necessarily being generated out of earnings, but out of other TARP funds. In an April 21 interview with Fox News Neil Cavuto, Barofsky repeated his assessment that the repayment was ""good news"" but should be taken with a grain of salt. ""I mean, the good news is, that money  they already have that money thats in that escrow account, so it does lower the total amount of money that they owe to the government, so thats somewhat good news,"" Barofsky said. ""But I dont think we should exaggerate it too much, when we remember where  the source of this money is just other TARP money."" The presidents and GMs statements may have given some the false impression that taxpayers have gotten back all the bailout money loaned to or invested in GM. Strictly speaking, Obama was accurate when he said: ""GM announced that it paid back its loans to taxpayers with interest, fully five years ahead of schedule."" But he alluded only vaguely to other bailout money, which taxpayers may never get back, adding: ""It wont be too long before the stock the Treasury is holding in GM can be sold, helping to reimburse the American people for their investment."" Those statements might have confused anyone who wasnt familiar with the details of GMs stock-and-loan debt to the Treasury. As for Treasurys equity stake, worth $40 billion-plus, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the Treasury wont fully recoup that money. The total automaker bailout, including TARP money given to Chrysler, CBO estimates, will cost taxpayers about $34 billion.  Lori Robertson Update, May 3: The CBO doesnt give a breakdown of how much of its $34 billion cost estimate for the bailout would have gone to General Motors. But most of the automaker bailout funds went to GM. While the Treasury has a 61 percent equity stake in GM, its stake in Chrysler is 9.9 percent. Sources Obama, Barack. Weekly address, transcript.

22739,Rand Paul: Republicans 'Aren't Maybe Brave Enough' to Tackle Deficit,"In an exclusive interview with ABC News, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., took aim at the newly released House GOP budget, saying it falls far short of what needs to be done to deal with the federal deficit. ""It's really not going to touch the problem,"" Paul said. ""There's a disconnect between Republicans who want a balanced budget but aren't maybe yet brave enough to talk about the cuts to come."" The plan by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., released on Thursday, would cut non-security discretionary spending by $58 billion by the end of fiscal year 2011, which ends on Sept. 30. In an far-ranging interview aboard the Capitol Subway, Paul embraced the label ""true believer"" and said staying true to the principles of the Tea Party movement is more important to him than being a Republican. He also refused to rule out a future run for president and suggested it may be time to reduce U.S. force levels in Afghanistan. Paul has proposed his own plan to cut spending by $500 billion this year. Paul's plan would impose deep across-the-board spending cuts -- including a reduction of 83 percent from the Department of Education, 6 percent from the Department of Defense and the elimination all foreign aid. He considers it just a start. ""I go to a tea party and you know what they say to me? It's not enough. It's not enough. Where's the other trillion you need?"" Paul said. Paul defended his call to end to all foreign aid -- including the $3 billion the U.S. gives to Israel every year. ""I'm not singling out Israel. I support Israel. I want to be known as a friend of Israel,"" Paul said, ""but not with money you don't have. We can't just borrow from our kids' future and give it to countries even if they are our friends."" Paul has come under fire from supporters of Israel, but said Israel has enough financial resources to fend for itself. ""I think they're an important ally, but I also think that their per capita income is greater than probably three-fourths of the rest of the world,"" Paul said. ""Should we be giving free money or welfare to a wealthy nation? I don't think so."" And military resources, as well. ""I think they're probably 10 years ahead of any neighboring country,"" he said. ""I think that their defense is very significant and probably well in advance of any of their particular enemies."" Regarding Afghanistan, Paul said it is up to the president to determine troop levels, but, ""I personally think you can have a much smaller presence."" As for his own political allegiances, Paul made it clear he is a Tea Party activist first and a Republican second. ""There are always problems in our nation's capitol that are more important than party affiliation and I will always believe that,"" Paul said. ""It's not necessarily Tea Party versus Republican Party, but I would say that if you ask me what's more important, tackling our nation's deficit, our nation's debt problems or being a Republican, I would say tackling the debt.""",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/04/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-israels-capita-income-greater-proba/,Economy,Polifact
22805,A train that Ohioans were lucky to miss: Brent Larkin,"During his classless exit from office, Gov. Ted Strickland has constantly whined of the ""tragic"" decision by Gov.-elect John Kasich to kill a passenger rail plan for Ohio, labeling it perhaps the saddest event of Strickland's one term as governor. Strickland's decency has long been considered his strongest attribute. But by spending the last two months desperately rewriting history, he stands in real danger of being remembered more for anger and bitterness. In any case, his stubborn support for the train proves that being a good man doesn't guarantee good decisions. While the outgoing governor may have been saddened by Kasich's decision to return a $400 million federal grant to build a train system linking Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati, the decision should have cheered Ohioans. By telling the federal government to keep its $400 million, Kasich probably saved the state's taxpayers at least that much. Critics, including Strickland, have depicted Kasich's decision as a jobs-killer. Actually, proceeding with this boondoggle would have caused far more economic pain. Over time, the train project would have blown such a gigantic hole in the state budget it would have adversely impacted state spending for schools, children, the poor, the aged and the ill. Voters never warmed to the idea of spending hundreds of millions on a passenger rail project that would have taken riders from Cleveland to Cincinnati over a period an hour and 15 minutes longer than it would have taken on a New York Central train in 1935. A Columbus Dispatch poll in September showed that far more Ohioans opposed the train plan than supported it. Nevertheless, in a vain attempt to sell this project to the public, state officials changed their story so often it made the head swim. Truth is, one needn't be Nostradamus to project cost overruns totaling hundreds of millions of dollars -- with the money to cover those overruns coming directly from the pockets of Ohio taxpayers. When the Obama administration offered Ohio $400 million for the rail project, Strickland administration officials essentially said, ""Sure, that should cover it."" But just months earlier, as part of the state's application to the feds, the administration placed the startup cost at $563.7 million. It gets worse. A Government Accounting Office study of transportation projects, requested by Congress, concluded in March 2009 that passenger rail projects ""had the highest cost escalation out of all the transportation modes studied -- averaging 45 percent higher than estimated."" ODOT's ridership predictions called for an annual taxpayer subsidy of $17 million over 20 years. But that same GAO report cited a study of 27 rail projects that found ridership forecasts for 90 percent of the projects were overestimated, with 67 percent overestimated by more than two-thirds. Last month, Strickland said the train plan would have created 16,000 jobs, a figure that doubled the state's earlier estimates of 8,000 jobs. ODOT's own website claims 8,000 jobs -- and even that figure is wildly inflated. Think about it: Aside from the temporary work to upgrade existing railroad track, how many people does it take to run three or four trains a day up and down the state? A few hundred sounds about right. A Time magazine story published just last week concluded that Ohio's ""pitiful"" rail plan""did not make sense"" and actually had the potential to ""destroy momentum for investments"" in legitimate high-speed rail. A far better use of the rail money would have been to build a new system with 120-mph train service linking the Cleveland and Akron airports. Or to begin a real high-speed system in growth areas of southwest Ohio. Those types of wise and creative investments in rail -- in trains that travel faster than the ones in the 1800s did -- actually might have created meaningful jobs and grown Ohio's economy. The project Kasich killed was neither wise nor creative. And sending $400 million back to the federal government wasn't the least bit sad. Goodbye, and thank you Cuyahoga County Commissioner Tim Hagan left office last week; county Treasurer Jim Rokakis will leave in a week or two -- departures mandated by the county government reform approved by voters in 2009. Together, the two served more than six decades in elected life. Rokakis was treasurer for nearly 14 years after earlier spending nearly two decades on Cleveland City Council. Hagan served two stints as commissioner totaling 24 years. Rokakis was perhaps the most gifted and creative county official of the past quarter-century. Hagan's initial, 16-year run as commissioner, from 1982 to 1998, was clearly his best work. But throughout his long career in elected life, Hagan's reputation for integrity remained intact and he never wavered from a genuine commitment to the county's less fortunate citizens. In recent years, Rokakis and Hagan weren't always treated fairly in news coverage. Like all of us, both have flaws. Rokakis can be notoriously thin-skinned and Hagan's demeanor can at times be mistaken for arrogance. But over the long haul, both made significant contributions and served this community well.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2011/jan/07/brent-larkin/columnist-brent-larkins-claim-about-1935-steam-tra/,Economy,Polifact

23277,Bob Gibbs,"Issues JOBS AND THE ECONOMY Ohioans want to know that Washington is working for us, not the other way around. I understand that government does not create jobs, people do. We need an economic policy that gets DC bureaucrats out of the way of the men and women who start and expand their businesses. We cannot afford to have bureaucratic red tape and senseless regulations prevent our parents, siblings, or friends and neighbors from achieving the American Dream. If we want to give every person his or her chance at the American Dream, we have to: 1. Get federal spending under control 2. Enact commonsense regulatory reform that does not punish those just starting a business 3. Tackle and reform our tax code to help families and incentivize work for all Americans 4. Promote an energy policy that encourages the responsible development of our natural resources, creating a safe, reliable and affordable energy supply for all Americans GOVERNMENT SPENDING Its no secret that Washingtons spending is out of control. We cannot continue down the path we are on and DCs reckless spending must be reined in. I have consistently voted against legislation that increases spending. It is time government learns to live within their means, which is why I support a constitutional amendment requiring Congress to balance the budget every year. REGULATORY REFORM One thing I hear all the time from Ohioans is that government rules and regulations can make life a nightmare for farmers, business owners or entrepreneurs. Burdensome and unnecessary regulations are hidden taxes that make it harder for Americans to realize their full potential. Worse yet, it drives up prices for those struggling to get by. I am on record supporting legislation that requires Congress give an up or down vote on costly new regulations that will negatively impact Americans. If we want to reform Washington, we have to reform the way they regulate. TAX REFORM Washingtons overspending wont be solved with higher taxes. We cannot tax our way out of deficit spending and should not do it on the backs of Ohios families. We need a tax code that gives Americans the opportunity to rise and that encourages economic growth. Our tax system should encourage American companies to stay in the United States and to hire American workers. Having the highest corporate tax rate in the world only incentivizes companies to move their operations and workforce overseas. We need a tax policy that encourages and rewards work, a system that helps people be lifted up out of poverty. THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS The Second Amendment is not a suggestion; it is a God-given right of the people to self-defense. I have consistently supported legislation that protects and expands an Americans right to keep and bear arms. Gun control regulations will only hurt law-abiding citizens while doing nothing to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. I am proud of my record of supporting the right of sportsmen to carry concealed firearms on government lands and expanding the ability of Americans who follow the law to carry concealed firearms. PROTECTING THE RIGHT TO LIFE Every life is precious, a gift from God. We should do everything we can to protect the lives of the unborn, those who are the most vulnerable and voiceless. I have always supported pro-life efforts and believe groups that perform abortions, like Planned Parenthood, should not get one dime of taxpayer dollars. I have also supported legislation that stops abortions later than 20 weeks, which is when babies are able to begin feeling pain. We must do more to protect those who cannot speak for themselves. ENERGY We have been blessed with an abundance of natural resources. The energy renaissance occurring in Ohio and other states has shown that new technologies and private sector innovation is the key to a thriving economy powered by safe, reliable and affordable energy. Obamas war on coal is having devastating effects on the communities that rely on coal for jobs and for affordable energy. The take-home pay for everyday Americans is stagnant, so why would anyone want to squeeze their budgets even further? Making it harder and more expensive to mine and utilize coal will hurt Americans that are already hurting the most. I believe in an energy policy that encourages the responsible development of our naturals resources, creates jobs and powers our economy with safe and affordable energy. HEALTH CARE Its simple: Obamacare must be repealed. Premiums are skyrocketing, deductibles are increasing and coverage networks are shrinking. Government-run healthcare is not the answer. We need health care reform that empowers Americans to take control of their care, to make sure decisions are made between a doctor and a patient. Bureaucrats in Washington should not be deciding what treatments a patient should be getting. Health care reform must focus on these principles: 1. Strenghten the doctor-patient relationship 2. Encourage the use of health savings accounts for routine visits and preventive care 3. Implement market-based reforms that encourage private sector competition Theres no doubt that our health care industry needs reforms, but bigger government will make the problems worse. NATIONAL SECURITY Our top priority needs to be the protection and safety of our nation. We are facing threats at home and abroad. ISIS is a real threat to the United States; it is not the JV team Obama says it is. We must do everything we can to protect our nation and prevent a major attack on U.S. soil. Recent attacks in Europe highlight how important it is to thoroughly vet refugees attempting to enter the United States. We should pause our acceptance of Syrian and Iraqi refugees until a system is put in place to make absolutely certain there are no terrorists slipping through the cracks and entering our nation.

23440,"Penniless California issues IOUs to firms, clinics, taxpayers and students","Money woes in the most populous US state have given birth to an impromptu trading market for the newest of American financial instruments  the California IOU. Encumbered by a $26bn (16bn) budget shortfall and a seemingly intractable political stalemate, California's state government is issuing IOUs to businesses, health clinics, college students and taxpayers who are owed money by the state. The green documents look like any ordinary cheque except for the words ""registered warrant"" stamped in the corner. They carry a 3.75% interest rate and can be cashed in October, by which time California's governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, is hoping that he will have some money. Entrepreneurs have been quick to leap on the phenomenon, with Craigslist and eBay cluttered with offers. A website, BuyMyIOU.com, aims to match sellers of the warrants with buyers eager to snap up the above-market interest rate. ""The market's at an early stage  we're really in the infancy of it right now,"" said Mark Granger, president of Pacific West Managers, a finance company offering to buy IOUs. ""It's a little unusual to see the state of California resorting to paying its bills like this."" California is the world's eighth largest economy but its financial situation is grave. The once booming property market has been hit catastrophically by foreclosures and its wealthy elite have seen their income wiped out by stockmarket woes. Usually 1% of the population contribute 50% of income tax revenue, but the capital gains of these rich individuals have evaporated. Dismal relations between Democrats and Republicans have all but frozen business in the state capital, Sacramento. A two-thirds majority is required to pass any budget, but Republicans, with just over a third of the legislature, are refusing to countenance tax rises while the Democrats are balking at spending cuts. Schwarzenegger has proposed deep cuts to social programmes, including aid for the elderly, disabled and impoverished, plus cuts to schools, healthcare and universities. Larry Gerston, a professor of political science at San Jos State University, says this will accentuate an already yawning gap between the rich and poor: ""The state is quickly becoming an hourglass economy. The middle class is all but evaporating  people are either moving further to the top or sinking to the bottom."" The initial victims of the standoff are California's creditors, who had received 91,000 IOUs worth $354m as of the end of Thursday. High-street banks, including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase, agreed to cash them for a few days but announced that they would not accept them beyond the end of the week. ""There's a sentiment inside the banks that the longer they accept the warrants, the longer the budget impasse will go on,"" said Beth Mills, a spokeswoman for the Californian Bankers Association. That leaves IOU holders with limited options. Certain local credit unions are still taking the notes at face value. Beyond that, holders face a choice of either waiting until October to receive their money or selling them at a discount on a rapidly developing informal market. Many online offers for the IOUs propose dubious rates. On eBay, one buyer was willing to pay $140 in return for $170 worth of IOUs. Granger, whose firm sees the debt crisis as a potentially lucrative opportunity, said a market rate was emerging of between 80 and 95 cents on the dollar. ""Because they're cumbersome and troublesome to deal with, a lot of the big investment houses are not going to deal with them,"" he said. ""And some people will just put them in their piggy banks."" Last week, the credit agency Fitch cut its rating on California's debt by two notches from ""A minus"" to BBB - just two levels above ""junk"" status. Analysts fear that there could be weeks of IOUs to come. Gerston says a confrontational culture of extreme left-wing and right-wing politics has contributed to the morass, as has a reluctance to wake up to problems: ""Californians are known as laidback for a reason they've earned that reputation. Most people just don't believe what's in front of them. They just don't buy it.""",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/11/jerry-brown/jerry-brown-says-californias-not-golden-state-when/,Economy,Polifact
23781,America's Most Toxic Cities,"In Atlanta, Ga., you'll find southern gentility, a world-class music scene--and 21,000 tons of environmental waste. In spite of its charms, the city's combination of air pollution and atmospheric chemicals makes it the most toxic city in the country. An urban skyline dotted with puffing smokestacks isn't the only measure of a city's cleanliness (or lack thereof). Most major cities suffer from a range of unseen hazards. Contaminants can seep into the ground from bygone chemical spills or shuttered steel mills. Invisible leaks at industrial complexes discharge harmful substances into the air, or the normal course of business requires factories to expel toxins that eventually find their way to the water supply. While it may be the U.S. metro in the worst environmental shape, Atlanta isn't the only place whose residents contend with contamination. Top spots for toxicity are distributed throughout the country, with Detroit, Houston, Chicago, Philadelphia, Cleveland and Los Angeles right behind it. Cleaning up these cities is neither easy nor cheap. The Environmental Protection Agency expects that it will cost $10.5 billion in federal money in 2010 to improve the U.S. environment's health in general and to craft clean energy solutions. Behind the Numbers To determine which cities are most toxic, Forbes looked at the country's 40 largest metropolitan statistical areas--geographic entities that the U.S. Office of Management and Budget defines and uses in collecting statistics--based on data provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. We counted the number of facilities that reported releasing toxins into the environment, the total pounds of certain toxic chemicals released into the air, water and earth, the days per year that air pollution was above healthy levels, and the number of times the EPA has responded to reports of a potentially hazardous environmental incident or site in each metro area's principal city. The reports vary in seriousness, and not all require clean-up action from the EPA. Click here to for an interactive chart to see how your city ranks. Click here for complete methodology and a glossary of environmental terms. Crowded urban areas are often thought of as the most polluted, but the latter isn't always caused by the former. While the Atlanta metro area takes top honors for toxicity, don't blame the city alone. The Atlanta metro includes the city of Marietta, the site of chemical plants and metal coaters. The city has toxic release levels higher than those of the principal city of Atlanta, in spite of a population 13% the size of Atlanta's. Environmental advocates say weak regulations are to blame. ""We struggle to have strong environmental leadership,"" says Jenette Gayer, policy advocate for Environment Georgia, an environmental advocacy organization. ""For a lot of the chemicals people reported dumping, there are alternatives we should be helping them switch to."" Similarly, while the Philadelphia metro area is our fourth most toxic area, the City of Brotherly Love doesn't hold the bulk of the blame for the pollution. Factories in smaller Wilmington, Del., in the same metro area, reported releasing 57% more pounds of toxins than Philadelphia in 2007. Wilmington houses a Pepsi bottler and General Motors assembly plant, as well as the headquarters of chemical company Dupont . Some cities, like Houston--our third most toxic city--contend with air that is far filthier than it should be. Facilities in Houston released 88.7 million pounds of toxic chemicals in the environment in 2007, and the former site of a methanol fire and chemical explosion number among the city's 50 sites necessitating an EPA response. Factories that serve the local petrochemical industry emit benzene and 1-3 butabeine, toxins proven to be particularly harmful, that the area's intense sunlight and lack of wind keep trapped in the local area's atmosphere. ""Houston has an air problem,"" says Jim Lester, vice president of the Houston Advanced Research Center, a Woodlands, Texas-based nonprofit that studies and promotes sustainable development. ""It has had one for a number of years, and we've been working on it extensively since about 2000."" Los Angeles, a city whose traffic-clogged freeways contribute to its famously poor air quality, experiences similar weather patterns that add to its existing air-quality problems. It ties for fourth most toxic city. ""Los Angeles is in a geographic basin surrounded by mountains,"" says Brian Turnbaugh, policy analyst for the Environmental Right to Know project at OMB Watch, a government watchdog organization. ""The pollution doesn't go away; it kind of just sits there, creating these horrible smog days."" Big Lights, Clean City High population density--the contrast to Atlanta's sprawl--can be a good thing in terms of toxicity. Limiting traffic has helped urban centers like New York City, which are often associated with grit and grime. A highly efficient subway system keeps New York outside the worst 20 cities in terms of toxicity. ""New York City has extremely high density, but excellent public transportation,"" says Turnbaugh. Still, the area is more toxic than 18 of the large cities we looked at, proving that cracking down on waste and emissions is a complex, long-term problem. ""The public transportation system can only accomplish so much, given that you've got people coming and going from outlying areas."" Some cities, like Portland, Ore., have avoided becoming highly toxic by devoting city resources to environmentally friendly planning. ""Portland is known for its innovative land-use policies,"" says Turnbaugh. The city has been working to curb urban sprawl and encourage density since the 1970s. But Portland has underlying problems that make it more toxic than half the cities we surveyed. ""It was suffering, for years, from out-of-control growth. Those policies were a reaction to that."" Portland and New York demonstrate the myriad and wide-ranging causes of toxicity. No one measure is enough to completely address the problem, nor can one solution apply to all toxic cities. These two cities themselves couldn't be more different in terms of size or lifestyle, yet they're next to each other on our list. ""I don't know of any metro area that has really nipped it in the bud,"" says Turnbaugh of the effort to assess and clean urban toxicity. But some of the most affected cities are attempting to address the problem with ambitious programs. ""Texas has invested $800 million in trying to replace old dirty diesel engines with cleaner diesel,"" says David Hitchcock, director of sustainable transportation programs at HARC. But a silver lining has emerged from the negative focus that one of the country's most toxic city has attracted: Houston, of all places, is now a vanguard for advancing sustainability. ""We're now one of the favorite places in the world for doing air-quality science,"" says Lester. ""The more people understand about it, the more changes are likely that will take us in a positive direction.""

23786,Sen. Gregg: President Obama's Budget Proposal Is a 'Disaster',"This is a rush transcript from ""On the Record,"" February 2, 2010. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Senator Judd Gregg just blasted the president's budget director, Peter Orszag, about President Obama's proposal to use TARP funds to help community banks lend to small businesses. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JUDD GREGG, R-N.H., BUDGET COMMITTEE: The whole concept of the TARP was that as we recoup the money, it would -- because we were borrowing it from our -- from Americans and from the Chinese -- and as we recoup that money, we would use it to pay down the debt. Now that's not going to happen. We're going to -- it's become a piggy bank. PETER ORSZAG, OMB DIRECTOR: Well, Senator... GREGG: It's a piggy bank which adds to our deficit, adds to our debt and gets put (INAUDIBLE) tax. ORSZAG: The degree to which shifting funds would add to our debt or deficits depends on what the net subsidy rate would be on that new activity. And remember, the purpose of TARP was to address problems in our financial markets. One of the -- and it has been remarkably successful in bringing credit spreads back down to normal levels. One of the lingering problems in our financial markets, however, is access to credit for small businesses. It's why in this budget, we're... GREGG: No, no, no! You can't make that type of statement with any legitimacy! ORSZAG: OK. GREGG: You cannot make that statement! This is the law! ORSZAG: (INAUDIBLE) they're not suffering from (INAUDIBLE) GREGG: Let me tell you what the law says! ORSZAG: ... lack of access... GREGG: Let me read it to you again because you don't appear to understand the law! The law is very clear! ""The monies recouped from the TARP shall be paid into the general fund of the treasury for the reduction of the public debt."" It's not for a piggy bank because you're concerned about lending to small businesses... ORSZAG: (INAUDIBLE) requirement (INAUDIBLE) GREGG: ... and you want to get a political event when you go out and make a speech in Nashua, New Hampshire. That's not what this money's for! This money is to reduce the debt of our children! (END VIDEO CLIP) VAN SUSTEREN: Ouch! Well, for the inside story on that showdown, we went to Capitol Hill and Senator Gregg went ""On the Record."" (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VAN SUSTEREN: Senator, nice to see you, sir. GREGG: Greta, thank you for having me. Thank you very much. VAN SUSTEREN: Well, thank you for letting us come to your office. GREGG: Appreciate you coming in. VAN SUSTEREN: All right, today you had quite a showdown with the -- with Peter Orszag. GREGG: Well, you know, they've sent up a budget which by their own terms is unsustainable. It puts us on a path which is basically going to lead us to fiscal insolvency as a nation, in my opinion, and I think in a lot of other people's opinion. It's a huge deficit machine, is what they've proposed, and that leads to debt. And the debt is not sustainable. It gets passed on to our kids, and basically, will lower the quality of life of our children, and that's not fair. I feel very strongly that when you send a budget like that up, you should also send up some fairly big ideas for how you're going to address it in the out years, how you're going to keep us from going off the road, how you're going to keep us from passing on to our kids a nation that can be afforded. And there are no big ideas in this budget on the issue of fiscal discipline. None. There are some -- there are some ideas, and I support their freeze concept. But the freeze is $10 billion. Compared to a $1.6 trillion deficit, it's really not going to get us there. VAN SUSTEREN: Well, one of the things that he brought up that, obviously, you were quite heated about, was the whole idea of taking some of the returned TARP money and giving it to community banks to the tune of $30 billion for lending. You say that that's not legal or not authorized by the statute. GREGG: No. The way TARP was set up, you know, we borrowed this money -- we borrowed it from Americans and we borrowed it from the Chinese, and we took it and we used it to stabilize the financial industry during a severe crisis which would have basically bankrupted Main Street, had all these banks failed. VAN SUSTEREN: So (INAUDIBLE) just set aside some cash... GRAHAM: No, this is not in a drawer somewhere. We had to go out and borrow it. And as part of that decision, there is very clear language put in the bill -- I wrote it, that's why I know it was clear -- that said when the money comes back -- and we expected it to come back, and in many cases, coming back with interest, so we're actually making money on it -- the money has to be used, shall be used to reduce the debt. That's what the law says. That's what TARP says. That was intentionally put in there so that the money could not be used as a piggy bank for whatever the initiative is, no matter how good an idea it is. Now the president is suggesting that he wants to take $30 billion of the paid back funds and use it for some other initiative. Well, that's not consistent with the law and it's not consistent with what we should do, basically. We should reduce the debt with this money. If we -- if we terminated TARP today, which we should, we would reduce the debt over the next couple of years by $200 billion $300 billion. That's a big chunk of debt reduction. And it -- and that's exactly what we should be doing with this TARP money. We shouldn't be using it to create a new program here, a new program there, depending on which way the wind is blowing on some given day. VAN SUSTEREN: Well, the word that I seized upon in listening to the exchange today is ""shall."" And when I was in law school, that wasn't a word that gave you any sort of wiggle room. It just must be. How does the -- how does the White House, the administration, justify saying that they can take the returned TARP money and send it out to these community banks, this $30 billion for loans? How do they justify it? GREGG: Well, the word is ""shall,"" and they can't do it legally. VAN SUSTEREN: So what happens? GREGG: So Mr. Orszag, to his credit, said they're going to change the law. You know, I mean, well, that makes no sense at all! I mean, the whole purpose here was to borrow money, put it out, stabilize the financial markets. When it gets paid back, pay down the borrowing so our kids didn't get stuck with the debt. What they're going to do is change the law so that they borrow the money, send it out to the stabilized financial institutions. When it gets paid back, they're going to spend it on something else so the debt is still out there and our kids still have to pay for it. VAN SUSTEREN: Do you think he knew the word ""shall"" was there before he showed up today? GREGG: No. VAN SUSTEREN: Or did you surprise him with ""shall""? GREGG: I'm not sure whether he knew it or not, but he pretty quickly confirmed that they were going to change the law. So he probably did know, yes. I guess I probably would have to give him credit for knowing it, yes. VAN SUSTEREN: So I take it you're not a big fan of the president's proposed budget. GREGG: No, the budget is a disaster. It really is. It's more government, more spending and more debt. But the real problem isn't the short run. The short run's a problem. But the real problem is in the out years, there's no compression of the delta. Spending continues to go up, and taxes can never catch it because the spending is going up so fast. They're taking the size of the government from 20 percent of the Gross National Product up to 25, 26 percent of the Gross National Product. That's simply not affordable. That means you're adding a trillion dollars of debt to our kids' backs every year for the foreseeable future. And at the end of 10 years, not only is it not coming down, it's still going up! VAN SUSTEREN: So what -- so if we were having this conversation 10 years from now, what would the economy look like, according to your prediction, assuming the president's proposed budget got passed? GREGG: I personally think we'll hit the wall long before 10 years. I think within 5 to 7 years... VAN SUSTEREN: What does that mean, ""hit the wall""? GREGG: It means that people have -- the people stop buying our debt or making it very difficult for us to sell debt, that the value of the currency is affected and that you either end up with a significant inflationary event or an event where you have to so significantly raise taxes that you reduce the productivity of the entire economy and you're no longer creating jobs. The simple situation -- the simple comparison is this. It's like a family that's been living beyond its means for many, many years and its income can never catch up with its debts. And at some point, the world community says to us, I'm sorry, we're not going to fund your debts any longer. We're simply not going to lend you the money you need. I mean, we're not operating off our own economy's ability to support us, we're operating because China is willing to lend us money and other nations are willing to lend us money. Well, they're putting up some fairly significant red flags right now that says, We're a little concerned about all your borrowing. And if we continue this borrowing, they're going to put up very severe red flags and say, Hey, maybe we're just not going to lend you anymore, or if we do lend to you, we're going to put a price on the lending which is so expensive that it makes it very hard for you to do much else with your government besides pay down your interest.

24308,Administration Is Seeking $700 Billion for Wall Street,"With Congressional Republicans warning that the bailout could be slowed by efforts to tack on additional provisions, Democratic leaders said they would insist on a requirement that the administration use its new role, as the owner of large amounts of mortgage debt, to help hundreds of thousands of troubled borrowers at risk of losing their homes to foreclosure. Its clear that the administration has requested that Congress authorize, in very short order, sweeping and unprecedented powers for the Treasury secretary, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, said in a statement. Democrats will work with the administration to ensure that our response to events in the financial markets is swift, but we must insulate Main Street from Wall Street and keep people in their homes. Ms. Pelosi said Democrats would also insist on enacting an economic recovery package that creates jobs and returns growth to our economy. Even as talks got under way, there were signs of how very much in flux the plan remained. The administration suggested that it might adjust its proposal, initially restricted to purchasing assets from financial institutions based in the United States, to enable foreign firms with United States affiliates to make use of it as well. The ambitious effort to transfer the bad debts of Wall Street, at least temporarily, into the obligations of American taxpayers was first put forward by the administration late last week after a series of bold interventions on behalf of ailing private firms seemed unlikely to prevent a crash of world financial markets. A $700 billion expenditure on distressed mortgage-related assets would roughly be what the country has spent so far in direct costs on the Iraq war and more than the Pentagons total yearly budget appropriation. Divided across the population, it would amount to more than $2,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States. Whatever is spent will add to a budget deficit already projected at more than $500 billion next year. And it comes on top of the $85 billion government rescue of the insurance giant American International Group and a plan to spend up to $200 billion to shore up the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Advertisement Continue reading the main story At his news conference, Mr. Bush also sought to portray the plan as helping every American. The government, he said, needed to send a clear signal that we understood the instability could ripple throughout and affect the working people and the average family, and we werent going to let that happen. A program to help troubled borrowers refinance mortgages  along with an $800 billion increase in the national debt limit  was approved in July. But financing for it depended largely on fees paid by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have been placed into a government conservatorship. Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said in an interview that his staff had already begun working with the Senate banking committee to draft additions to the administrations proposal. Mr. Frank said Democrats were particularly intent on limiting the huge pay packages for corporate executives whose firms seek aid under the new plan, raising the prospect of a contentious battle with the White House. There are going to be federal tax dollars buying up some of the bad paper, Mr. Frank said. They should accept some compensation guidelines, particularly to get rid of the perverse incentives where its heads I win, tails I break even.  Mr. Frank said Democrats were also thinking about tightening the language on the debt limit to make clear that the additional borrowing authority could be used only for the bailout plan. And he said they might seek to revive a proposal that would give bankruptcy judges the authority to modify the terms of primary mortgages, a proposal strongly opposed by the financial industry. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who attended emergency meetings with the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, on Capitol Hill last week, described the proposal as a good start but said it did little for regular Americans. Photo This is a good foundation of a plan that can stabilize markets quickly, Mr. Schumer said in a statement. But it includes no visible protection for taxpayers or homeowners. We look forward to talking to Treasury to see what, if anything, they have in mind in these two areas. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Pelosis statement made clear that she would push for an economic stimulus initiative either as part of the bailout legislation or, more likely, as part of the budget resolution Congress must adopt before adjourning for the fall elections. Such a plan could include an increase in unemployment benefits and spending on infrastructure projects to help create jobs. Some Congressional Republicans warned Democrats not to overreach. The administration has put forward a plan to help the American people, and it is now incumbent on Congress to work together to solve this crisis, said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader. Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Mr. Boehner added, Efforts to exploit this crisis for political leverage or partisan quid pro quo will only delay the economic stability that families, seniors and small businesses deserve. Aides to Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, the Democratic presidential nominee, said he was reviewing the proposal. In Florida, Mr. Obama told voters he would press for a broader economic stimulus. We have to make sure that whatever plan our government comes up with works not just for Wall Street, but for Main Street, Mr. Obama said. We have to make sure it helps folks cope with rising prices, and sparks job creation, and helps homeowners stay in their homes. Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican nominee, issued a statement saying he, too, was reviewing the plan. This financial crisis, Mr. McCain said, requires leadership and action in order to restore a sound foundation to financial markets, get our economy on its feet, and eliminate this burden on hardworking middle-class Americans. If adopted, the bailout plan would sharply raise the stakes for the new administration on the appointment of a new Treasury secretary. The administrations plan would allow the Treasury to hire staff members and engage outside firms to help manage its purchases. And officials said that the administration envisioned enlisting several outside firms to help run the effort to buy up mortgage-related assets. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Officials said that details were still being worked out but that one idea was for the Treasury to hold reverse auctions, in which the government would offer to buy certain classes of distressed assets at a particular price and firms would then decide if they were willing to sell at that price, or could bid the price lower. Mindful of a potential political fight, Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke held a series of conference calls with members of Congress on Friday to begin convincing them that action was needed not just to help Wall Street but everyday Americans as well. Republicans typically supportive of the administration said they were in favor of approving the plan as swiftly as possible. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said in a statement, This proposal is, and should be kept, simple and clear. The majority leader, Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said that the bailout was needed but that Mr. Bush owed the public a fuller explanation. Some lawmakers were more critical or even adamantly opposed to the plan. The free market for all intents and purposes is dead in America, Senator Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky, declared on Friday. It is far from clear how much distressed debt the government will end up purchasing, though it seemed likely that the $700 billion figure was large enough to send a reassuring message to the jittery markets. There are estimates that firms are carrying $1 trillion or more in bad mortgage-related assets. The ultimate price tag of the bailout is virtually impossible to know, in part because of the possibility that taxpayers could profit from the effort, especially if the market stabilizes and real estate prices rise. Lehman Can Sell to Barclays A federal bankruptcy judge decided early Saturday that Lehman Brothers could sell its investment banking and trading businesses to Barclays, the big British bank, the first major step to wind down the nations fourth-largest investment bank.

24311,Smart Politics,"Nevadans head to the polls in their state primary Tuesday and thousands will cast their gubernatorial vote for None of these candidates  an option provided to the voters in primary and general elections for more than 40 years.

24925,Obama's Remarks at the Associated Press' Annual Meeting,"Obama's Remarks at the Associated Press' Annual Meeting Good afternoon. I know I kept a lot of you guys busy this weekend with the comments I made lastweek. Some of you might even be a little bitter about that. As I said yesterday, I regret some of the words I chose, partly because the way that these remarks have been interpreted have offended some people and partly because they have served as one more distraction from the critical debate that we must have in this election season. I'm a person of deep faith, and my religion has sustained me through a lot in my life. I even gave a speech on faith before I ever started running for President where I said that Democrats, ""make a mistake when we fail to acknowledge the power of faith in people's lives."" I also represent a state with a large number of hunters and sportsmen, and I understand how important these traditions are to families in Illinois and all across America. And, contrary to what my poor word choices may have implied or my opponents have suggested, I've never believed that these traditions or people's faith has anything to do with how much money they have. But I will never walk away from the larger point that I was trying to make. For the last several decades, people in small towns and cities and rural areas all across this country have seen globalization change the rules of the game on them. When I began my career as an organizer on the South Side of Chicago, I saw what happens when the local steel mill shuts its doors and moves overseas. You don't just lose the jobs in the mill, you start losing jobs and businesses throughout the community. The streets are emptier. The schools suffer. I saw it during my campaign for the Senate in Illinois when I'd talk to union guys who had worked at the local Maytag plant for twenty, thirty years before being laid off at fifty-five years old when it picked up and moved to Mexico; and they had no idea what they're going to do without the paycheck or the pension that they counted on. One man didn't even know if he'd be able to afford the liver transplant his son needed now that his health care was gone. I've heard these stories almost every day during this campaign, whether it was in Iowa or Ohio or Pennsylvania. And the people I've met have also told me that every year, in every election, politicians come to their towns, and they tell them what they want to hear, and they make big promises, and then they go back to Washington when the campaign's over, and nothing changes. There's no plan to address the downside of globalization. We don't do anything about the skyrocketing cost of health care or college or those disappearing pensions. Instead of fighting to replace jobs that aren't coming back, Washington ends up fighting over the latest distraction of the week. And after years and years and years of this, a lot of people in this country have become cynical about what government can do to improve their lives. They are angry and frustrated with their leaders for not listening to them; for not fighting for them; for not always telling them the truth. And yes, they are bitter about that. Now, Senator McCain and the Republicans in Washington are already looking ahead to the fall and have decided that they plan on using these comments to argue that I'm out of touch with what's going on in the lives of working Americans. I don't blame them for this -- that's the nature of our political culture, and if I had to carry the banner for eight years of George Bush's failures, I'd be looking for something else to talk about too. But I will say this. If John McCain wants to turn this election into a contest about which party is out of touch with the struggles and the hopes of working America, that's a debate I'm happy to have. In fact, I think that's a debate we need to have. Because I believe that the real insult to the millions of hard-working Americans out there would be a continuation of the economic agenda that has dominated Washington for far too long. I may have made a mistake last week in the words that I chose, but the other party has made a much more damaging mistake in the failed policies they've chosen and the bankrupt philosophy they've embraced for the last three decades. It's a philosophy that says there's no role for government in making the global economy work for working Americas; that we have to just sit back watch those factories close and those jobs disappear; that there's nothing we can do or should do about workers without health care, or children in crumbling schools, or families who are losing their homes, and so we should just hand out a few tax breaks and wish everyone the best of luck. Ronald Reagan called this trickle-down economics. George Bush called it the Ownership Society. But what it really means is that you're on your own. If your premiums or your tuition is rising faster than you can afford, you're on your own. If you're that Maytag worker who just lost his pension, tough luck. If you're a child born into poverty, you'll just have to pull yourself up by your own bootstraps. This philosophy isn't just out-of-touch - it's put our economy out-of-whack. Years of pain on Main Street have finally trickled up to Wall Street and sent us hurtling toward recession, reminding us that we're all connected - that we can't prosper as a nation where a few people are doing well and everyone else is struggling. John McCain is an American hero and a worthy opponent, but he's proven time and time again that he just doesn't understand this. It took him three tries in seven days just to figure out that the home foreclosure crisis was an actual problem. He's had a front row seat to the last eight years of disastrous policies that have widened the income gap and saddled our children with debt, and now he's promising four more years of the very same thing. He's promising to make permanent the Bush tax breaks for the wealthiest few who didn't need them and didn't ask for them - tax breaks that are so irresponsible that John McCain himself once said they offended his conscience. He's promising four more years of trade deals that don't have a single safeguard for American workers - that don't help American workers compete and win in a global economy. He's promising four more years of an Administration that will push for the privatization of Social Security - a plan that would gamble away people's retirement on the stock market; a plan that was already rejected by Democrats and Republicans under George Bush. He's promising four more years of policies that won't guarantee health insurance for working Americans; that won't bring down the rising cost of college tuition; that won't do a thing for the Americans who are living in those communities where the jobs have left and the factories have shut their doors. And yet, despite all this, the other side is still betting that the American people won't notice that John McCain is running for George Bush's third term. They think that they'll forget about all that's happened in the last eight years; that they'll be tricked into believing that it's either me or our party is the one that's out of touch with what's going on in their lives. Well I'm making a different bet. I'm betting on the American people. The men and women I've met in small towns and big cities across this country see this election as a defining moment in our history. They understand what's at stake here because they're living it every day. And they are tired of being distracted by fake controversies. They are fed up with politicians trying to divide us for their own political gain. And I believe they'll see through the tactics that are used every year, in every election, to appeal to our fears, or our biases, or our differences - because they've never wanted or needed change as badly as they do now. The people I've met during this campaign know that government cannot solve all of our problems, and they don't expect it to. They don't want our tax dollars wasted on programs that don't work or perks for special interests who don't work for us. They understand that we cannot stop every job from going overseas or build a wall around our economy, and they know that we shouldn't. But they believe it's finally time that we make health care affordable and available for every single American; that we bring down costs for workers and for businesses; that we cut premiums, and stop insurance companies from denying people care or coverage who need it most. They believe it's time we provided real relief to the victims of this housing crisis; that we help families refinance their mortgage so they can stay in their homes; that we start giving tax relief to the people who actually need it - middle-class families, and seniors, and struggling homeowners. They believe that we can and should make the global economy work for working Americans; that we might not be able to stop every job from going overseas, but we certainly can stop giving tax breaks to companies who send them their and start giving tax breaks to companies who create good jobs right here in America. We can invest in the types of renewable energy that won't just reduce our dependence on oil and save our planet, but create up to five million new jobs that can't be outsourced. They believe we can train our workers for those new jobs, and keep the most productive workforce the most competitive workforce in the world if we fix our public education system by investing in what works and finding out what doesn't; if we invest in early childhood education and finally make college affordable for everyone who wants to go; if we stop talking about how great our teachers are and start rewarding them for their greatness. They believe that if you work your entire life, you deserve to retire with dignity and respect, which means a pension you can count on, and Social Security that's always there. This is what the people I've met believe about the country they love. It doesn't matter if they're Democrats or Republicans; whether they're from the smallest towns or the biggest cities; whether they hunt or they don't; whether they go to church, or temple, or mosque, or not. We may come from different places and have different stories, but we share common hopes, and one very American dream. That is the dream I am running to help restore in this election. If I get the chance, that is what I'll be talking about from now until November. That is the choice that I'll offer the American people - four more years of what we had for the last eight, or fundamental change in Washington. People may be bitter about their leaders and the state of our politics, but beneath that, they are hopeful about what's possible in America. That's why they leave their homes on their day off, or their jobs after a long day of work, and travel - sometimes for miles, sometimes in the bitter cold - to attend a rally or a town hall meeting held by Senator Clinton, or Senator McCain, or myself. Because they believe that we can change things. Because they believe in that dream. I know something about that dream. I wasn't born into a lot of money. I was raised by a single mother with the help my grandparents, who grew up in small-town Kansas, went to school on the GI Bill, and bought their home through an FHA loan. My mother had to use food stamps at one point, but she still made sure that through scholarships, I got a chance to go to some of the best schools around, which helped me get into some of the best colleges around, which gave me loans that Michelle and I just finished paying not all that many years ago. In other words, my story is a quintessentially American story. It's the same story that has made this country a beacon for the world--a story of struggle and sacrifice on the part of my forebearers and a story overcoming great odds. I carry that story with me each and every day, It's why I wake up every day and do this, and it's why I continue to hold such hope for the future of a country where the dreams of its people have always been possible. Thank you.

153,Man finds out he pays Ohio River bridge's electric bill,"Buy Photo Duke Energy charged a Covington business owner to light the Clay Wade Bailey bridge across the Ohio River for five months. (Photo: The Enquirer/Cara Owsley)Buy Photo COVINGTON, Ky.  Business owner Marty Boyer accidentally paid the electric bill for lights on the Clay Wade Bailey Bridge for five months. Boyer was charged based on electrical poles across West Third Street from the Theatre House in Covington, a business he acquired in November. The poles supply electricity for lights on the Ohio River bridge, Duke Energy acknowledged Monday after Boyer made a ""plea for help"" on social media. Boyer noticed in January the bill seemed too high. Plus, there were more meters than his business, a theatrical supply house, would require. He started calling Duke in January. Frustrated by Duke's inaction, Boyer told Duke to turn off the meters across the street on March 19 not knowing what they powered. The lights stayed on at the Theatre House, but a Duke worker showed up the next day asking who turned the lights off. ""(The) lesson here: Want to get attention, turn off the lighting on the bridge,"" Boyer said. The billing error  which was costing Boyer about $200 a month  persisted until it was brought to Duke Energy's attention Monday by The Enquirer. Earlier Monday Boyer vented about his dilemma on Facebook, fed up with inaction from Duke customer service. Duke Energy called the Theatre House owner Monday to apologize, said Sally Thelen, a company spokeswoman. ""We were very apologetic and acknowledged that we can do better,"" Thelen said. The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, responsible for the bridge lighting, was supposed to be billed. Duke can and will do better, Thelen said. This will be a ""teachable"" moment, she said. ""Definitely there were some issues on our end about how we were handling instances of his billing,"" she said. Covington's Theatre House owner Marty Boyer says his company was charged for three utility poles across West Third Street that help light the Clay Wade Bailey Bridge. (Photo: Provided/Marty Boyer) Boyer estimates he spent at least 25 hours trying to talk with employees to stop billing him for the bridge lighting since he first complained in January. Boyer said he was told Duke couldn't find someone to bill at the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet. Duke asked him to call the Transportation Cabinet. Covington's Theatre House owner Marty Boyer says his company was charged for three utility poles across West Third Street that help light the Clay Wade Bailey Bridge. (Photo: Provided/Marty Boyer) Everyone he spoke with made him retell the entire story about how he ended up paying the bridge's light bill. ""Everyone was like this would be on snopes.com, and I'm like, no this is real,"" Boyer said.

566,"House Approves GOP Tax Overhaul, With Senate Outlook Uncertain","House Approves GOP Tax Overhaul, With Senate Outlook Uncertain Enlarge this image toggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP Jacquelyn Martin/AP The House has narrowly approved a $1.4 trillion tax overhaul, clearing the first major hurdle in Republican attempts to cut taxes and rewrite the tax code. The vote was almost along party lines, with no Democrats voting in support of the bill and some GOP defections over provisions in the measure that would eliminate important tax deductions taken by constituents in some high tax states. ""It has been 31 years since we last did this, and it is finally time that we get the general interest of this country to prevail over the special interests in Washington,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan said on the House floor, pledging that the bill would leader to faster economic growth and bigger paychecks for American workers. The last major tax overhaul took place in 1986 under President Ronald Reagan, with a Republican-controlled Senate and Democrat-controlled House. President Trump made a rare appearance at the Capitol to rally GOP lawmakers in advance of the vote. ""It was a good meeting. Taxes are going really well,"" Trump told reporters. The 440-page legislation would reduce the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, winning support from outside groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Business. But its effect on individuals is less dramatic. It reduces from seven to four the number of tax brackets and doubles the standard deduction, while eliminating many other deductions and credits. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has an extensive breakdown of the measure. The Senate is considering its own tax overhaul, which is still in committee. In recent days, it has been altered so that tax rates for individuals would be reduced only temporarily while corporate tax rates would be cut permanently. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson said he is against the bill in its current form because the cuts that would be temporary would also impact small businesses that pay their taxes through individual rates. The Senate bill would also now include a provision to zero out the individual mandate penalty, one of the pillars of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, expressed reservations over this move. She is one of the Republicans who blocked efforts to repeal Obamacare this year. GOP leaders, prodded by the president, hope to agree on and approve a final tax bill by the end of the year, showing voters a major accomplishment in the first year of their majority after failing repeatedly on health care.",TRUE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/does-the-republican-tax-bill-include-a-loophole-benefitting-golf-course-owners/,Economy,Snopes
670,Customers Outraged After Buffalo Wild Wings Employee Silences National Anthem,"EASTVALE   The National Anthem is the focus of controversy again, this time at a bar in Riverside County. Customers at a Buffalo Wild Wings in Eastvale say an employee refused to let them hear the anthem before an NFL game Monday night  which happened to be the 16th anniversary of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. A customer who identified herself as Lori said the employee refused to play the sound of the anthem for one game, but played it for the game before. When he was asked why, the employee  who was not identified  said the anthem is too controversial, and it was company policy not to play it. No one understood what was so controversial. Its 9/11, its a sporting event, why is it controversial? she said. Lori took the employees picture and posted it on social media, where it spread quickly.

1088,The 2016 Haters Guide To The Williams-Sonoma Catalog,"I was on the Jersey Turnpike when I saw it. I was driving my family to New York for Thanksgiving and there, along the shittiest stretch of road in the shittiest state in America, I saw the Williams-Sonoma fulfillment center: a vast hangar that seemed to stretch a mile long, with shipping containers lined up along the side, like piglets feeding on a series of artisanal teats. It was located in a town called Cranbury because of course it fucking was. It made me wonder if Williams-Sonoma chose the town of Cranbury specifically for the whimsy of it, or if they CREATED the town and christened it Cranbury just so that it could match their mission statement of bringing holiday cheer and $75 baskets of glazed figs to the world. And I wont lie, it was kind of nice to see the fulfillment center, to see just where the (imported, dry-aged Portuguese) sausage (with white wine and fennel) is made. This has not been a pleasant year. Everyone good died. America is now a bad sitcom flash forward episode. And I got a camera up my dick. So it was nice to see all those trucks lined up in Cranbury, each one getting its marching orders to drive out to some pristine house on some pristine cul-de-sac in some pristine suburb. Call it Peppermintbarkvillea place that the rest of the world cannot touch, where even a nuclear holocaust could not intrude upon the bestowing of gold napkin rings and cheese assortments. Life as we know may end, but the Williams-Sonoma catalog, and the army of little Ina Gartens who have seemingly unlimited cash to spend on its wares, will endure.

1315,"Answer Man: Nectar Lounge fate, Nutz R Us mental health","The former Northside Grill will host a new yoga studio, slated to open Feb. 28, as well as a restaurant downstairs called Nectar. (Photo: Citizen-Times file photo) Today's batch of burning questions, my smart-aleck answers and the real deal: Question: What ever happened to the Nectar Lounge where Northside Grill used to be? There was so much hype, that it was going to open in August or September and there'd be a yoga studio, etc., upstairs. The website listed in the C-T article doesn't exist, and their Facebook page postings stopped in August. Just wondering. Healthy food on the north side is a good thing. My answer: Seriously, can you get more Asheville than a combo yoga studio/nectar lounge? I wonder if it would've been a hookah-style setup, with folks literally sipping nectar from huge, suspended vases from the ceilings. Real answer: Indeed, plans have changed. ""OK, so Centerpoint Discovery and Nectar Lounge never happened,"" Jaime Hadnagy, who was slated to be general manager of the business, told me via email. "" I left the project in the end of August, and soon after that, the project ended. Since then, there has been a shift in ownership. Also, the concept has changed slightly."" Hadnagy said she's working on the launch of Veda Studios in the upstairs, and the opening is slated for Feb. 28, ""and there will be free classes all day. Yay!"" ""Veda Studios is a movement studio offering yoga, dance and martial arts,"" Hadnagy said. ""As far as the downstairs, the restaurant is now being called Nectar. It is opening in the next few months and is a sister business to Veda Studios. The menu will still include raw food and juice, but they decided to add a dinner menu, which is farm-to-table Chinese food. There is a better energy now, and it is exciting that things are moving and more importantly there is an opening date!!"" I could feel the energy through the computer screen. Good luck! Question: So, this inquiry comes from a psychiatrist at Broughton Hospital in Morganton, Dr. Suzannah McCuen, who a few weeks back sent us a letter questioning the name choice of a local company. ""I learned today that a company in the Buncombe County area whose business it is to provide care facilities for the mentally ill is called Nutz R Us,"" McCuen said. ""I found that hard to believe and so Googled them and called one of their homes, White Fawn. The woman who answered the phone verified that Nutz R Us is the corporate name. She seemed to think that using a ""z"" in the spelling mitigated the harm, I suppose, as she pointed that out to me. An online search reveals this company runs several homes in the area. While I am grateful that this company is providing homes for the mentally ill, I find their choice of a company name offensive, to say the least. I am hopeful that some public exposure will convince them to change the company name while still endeavoring to provide much needed services and homes for the mentally ill in Western North Carolina."" My answer: I attempted a similar softening of an inappropriate phrase one time with one of my editors. Let me tell you, it didn't fly. Real answer: I didn't have much more luck than the good doctor in getting hold of someone with the company. I left multiple messages in January and last week with the administrator and at the White Fawn home, and I've not heard anything back. I don't think McCuen is going to let this go. She's alerted a patient advocacy organization and the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill. Businesses often use colorful parent company names  I know one or two that would not be appropriate for a family newspaper. But this one does seem a bit tin-eared for a mental health provider.

We mourn the loss of life and want justice for all those whose lives were affected. The FBI asked us for help in the days following the attack, and we have worked hard to support the governments efforts to solve this horrible crime. We have no sympathy for terrorists. When the FBI has requested data thats in our possession, we have provided it. Apple complies with valid subpoenas and search warrants, as we have in the San Bernardino case. We have also made Apple engineers available to advise the FBI, and weve offered our best ideas on a number of investigative options at their disposal. We have great respect for the professionals at the FBI, and we believe their intentions are good. Up to this point, we have done everything that is both within our power and within the law to help them. But now the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone. Specifically, the FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on an iPhone recovered during the investigation. In the wrong hands, this software  which does not exist today  would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someones physical possession. The FBI may use different words to describe this tool, but make no mistake: Building a version of iOS that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a backdoor.

8731,Starbucks Support of the Troops/Military,"Starbucks Support of the Troops/Military January 11, 2005 (updated November 2013) On behalf of Starbucks more than 200,000 dedicated partners (employees), we want to set the record straight on an old rumor concerning our companys lack of support for the military and our troops. This rumor, dating back to 2004, claims a lack of Starbucks support for the U.S. Marines, and has evolved to include a lack of support for the British Royal Marines. In both instances, the rumor is not, and has never been, true. When Starbucks learned of the original email, we immediately contacted the author, a Marine Sergeant, who subsequently sent an email to his original distribution list correcting the mistake. Unfortunately, rumors have a way of continuing even after the truth has been revealed. At Starbucks, we respect the efforts of the men and women who serve their country in the military  including our fellow partners who serve during this time of war. In fact, Starbucks recently made a strategic business decision to hire thousands of veterans and active duty military spouses over the next 5 years, given the unique skills and talents weve seen them bring to our workplace. Like Starbucks, the members of the U.S. military and their spouses share our passion for mission-driven leadership and service, and they exemplify the kinds of partners Starbucks wants to have as part of our team. In addition to our strategic hiring focus on veterans and active duty spouses, we have also made a commitment to expand our community store model with five military communities over the next five years in the U.S. Starting with stores in Lakewood, WA near Joint Base Lewis-McChord and in San Antonio, TX near Joint Base San Antonio, we will convert existing stores to community stores to share a portion of their profits to fund local non-profit programs that help veterans re-entering the workforce. Starbucks also has partnered with the American Red Cross and the United Service Organizations (USO) to provide coffee to relief efforts during times of conflict, donating more than 141,000 lbs of coffee and over one million 3-packs of Starbucks VIA. Additionally, troops all over the world are enjoying Starbucks VIA Ready Brew in care packages they receive not only from Starbucks, but from their family and friends as well. Last year, Starbucks provided over 220,000 3-packs of Starbucks VIA to the USO for their care package program. Confirmation that this rumor is a blatant untruth can be found online at snopes.com, boycottwatch.org, and truthorfiction.com. Below you will find the text from the Marine Sergeant correcting his mistake. Dear Readers, Almost 5 months ago I sent an e-mail to you my faithful friends. I did a wrong thing that needs to be cleared up. I heard by word of mouth about how Starbucks said they didnt support the war and all. I was having enough of that kind of talk and didnt do my research properly like I should have. This is not true. Starbucks supports men and women in uniform. They have personally contacted me and I have been sent many copies of their companys policy on this issue. So I apologize for this quick and wrong letter that I sent out to you. Now I ask that you all pass this email around to everyone you passed the last one to. Thank you very much for understanding about this. Howard C. Wright Sgt USMC 1st Force Rcon Co 1st Plt PLT RTO Dated: August 17, 2004 We have worked hard to put this rumor to rest, so that it no longer distracts from the many outstanding demonstrations our partners have made  on their own and together  to support the troops.

10160,Sophia Stewart wins the Matrix copyright infringement case,"New York, Nov 11 (THAINDIAN NEWS) Sophia Stewart an African American who claimed to be the author of The Matrix will finally receive her just due from the copyright infringement of her original work, as the copyright case is finally settled in court. A six-year dispute has ended which involved Sophia Stewart, the Wachowski Brothers, Joel Silver and Warner Brothers. Sophia Stewarts allegations, involving copyright infringement and racketeering, were well received and completely acknowledged by the Central District of California, where the Judge Margaret Morrow was presiding. Sophie Stewart had filed her copyright infringement case 10 years ago, in 1999, after viewing the acclaimed movie Matrix, which she felt had been based on her manuscript, The Third Eye, copyrighted in 1981. In the mid-eighties Stewart had submitted her manuscript to an advertisement placed by the Wachowski Brothers, requesting new sci-fi works, which could be later made into a movie. According to court documentation, an FBI investigation discovered that more than thirty minutes had been edited from the original film, in an attempt to avoid penalties for copyright infringement. The investigation also stated that credible witnesses employed at Warner Brothers came forward, claiming that the executives and lawyers had full knowledge that the work in question did not belong to the Wachowski Brothers. These witnesses claimed to have seen Stewarts original work and that it had been often used during preparation of the motion pictures. The defendants tried, on several occasions, to have Stewarts case dismissed, without success. Sophia Stewarts released a press statement which said: The Matrix & Terminator movie franchises have made world history and have ultimately changed the way people view movies and how Hollywood does business, yet the real truth about the creator and creation of these films continue to elude the masses because the hidden secret of the matter is that these films were created and written by a Black womana Black woman named Sophia Stewart. But Hollywood does not want you to know this fact simply because it would change history.

11137,Disabled Borrowers May Have Student Loans Forgiven,"On 12 April 2016, the U.S. Department of Education announced that hundreds of thousands of borrowers who are permanently disabled could have an estimated $7.7 billion in student loans forgiven: The U.S. Department of Education announced today a new process to proactively identify and assist federal student loan borrowers with disabilities who may be eligible for Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) loan discharge. This effort was called for by President Obama in his Student Aid Bill of Rights, which details measures to make paying for higher education an easier and fairer experience for millions of Americans. The Higher Education Act allows for loan forgiveness for borrowers who are totally and permanently disabled. By proactively identifying and engaging borrowers who may be eligible for TPD loan discharge, the Department is fulfilling its commitment to ensure that borrowers who are totally and permanently disabled have the information needed to take full advantage of the debt relief to which they are entitled. In 2012, the Administration took steps to streamline the process to allow for Americans who are totally and permanently disabled to use their Social Security designation to apply to have their loans discharged. But too many eligible borrowers were falling through the cracks, unaware they were eligible for relief. Borrowers like one such woman whose side effects from her breast cancer treatment left her totally and permanently disabled. After repeated attempts, she finally received a disability dischargeseven years after her first application, said U.S. Education Under Secretary Ted Mitchell. Under the new process, we will notify potentially eligible borrowers about the benefit and guide them through steps needed to discharge their loans, helping thousands of borrowers. Americans with disabilities have a right to student loan relief. And we need to make it easier, not harder, for them to receive the benefits they are due. As part of President Obamas Student Aid Bill of Rights  a move to help relieve Americans of crushing student loan debt  the Department of Education will be sending letters to 387,000 people who have been identified as eligible for a Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) loan discharge because they are disabled and cannot work. The Department of Education and Social Security Administration are working together to identify borrowers who have been receiving disability payments and are eligible to have their loans discharged. Those borrowers will be able to bypass the traditional disability discharge process, which requires them to furnish proof of their disability. Instead, these disabled borrowers will be able to simply fill out and sign the application sent to them in the letter they receive from the Department of Education.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/student-loan-forgiveness-scam/,Economy,Snopes
11777,Woman accused of giving husband lethal sherry enema,"Woman accused of giving husband lethal sherry enema HOUSTON -- Investigators say a woman caused her husband's death by giving him a sherry enema, leading to alcohol poisoning. The enema caused his blood alcohol level to soar to 0.47 percent -- almost six times the legal intoxication limit in Texas, a toxicology report showed. Tammy Jean Warner, 42, was indicted on a charge of negligent homicide. She is also charged with burning the will of her husband, Michael Warner, a month before his death on May 21. Michael Warner, a 58-year-old machine shop owner, had a long history of alcoholism but couldn't ingest alcohol by mouth because of painful medical problems with his throat, said Lake Jackson, Texas, police detective Robert Turner. The enema was a way he could become intoxicated without drinking alcohol, Turner said. ""I heard of this kind of thing in mortuary school in 1970, but this is the first time I've ever heard of someone actually doing it,"" Turner said.

""We're not talking about little bottles here,"" Turner said, ""These were at least 1.5-liter bottles."" Turner said police don't know if the victim had ever become intoxicated in that manner before the lethal incident. Tammy Warner told police that she found her husband dead in their bed. Turner said she admitted giving him the sherry enema, but not to causing his death. ""A person drinking alcohol will usually pass out before getting a lethal dose,"" Turner said. ""But if you're getting it through an enema, you can pass out and still be ingesting more alcohol."" Tammy Warner surrendered to Lake Jackson police Monday and was released on $30,000 bond. She could not be reached for comment Wednesday. Neither Turner nor Brazoria County District Attorney Jeri Yenne would comment on the charge related to the will. The indictment said providing Michael Warner with alcohol and destroying the will constituted a ""criminal episode."" Although Michael Warner may have agreed initially to the enema as a way to become intoxicated, Yenne said, ""he was not a willing participant in something that would cause his death."" ""He knew that it was very dangerous for him to have any form of alcohol and she knew it was very dangerous for him to have alcohol,"" Yenne said. The couple's neighbors said they were surprised Wednesday to learn of the indictment. John Criswell, 24, said the widow had mostly been away from the modest brown frame house at the end of the street since her husband died. ""She said she was scared to stay there by herself alone,"" Criswell said. ""She said she'd been having trouble with his family."" The couple had been married about two years, police said.

12151,8 FAQs about EMV credit cards,"Credit Cards  Credit Card News  8 FAQs about EMV credit cards 8 FAQs about EMV credit cards Chip? PIN? Signature? Do old cards work? Answers to frequently asked questions Personal finance writer Statistics enthusiast focused on data-driven content Its been almost two years since the nationwide shift to EMV officially began. EMV -- which stands for Europay, Mastercard and Visa -- is a global standard for cards equipped with computer chips and the technology used to authenticate chip-card transactions. In the wake of numerous large-scale data breaches and increasing rates of counterfeit card fraud, U.S. card issuers have migrated to this new technology to protect consumers and reduce the costs of fraud. ""These new and improved cards are being deployed to improve payment security, making it more difficult for fraudsters to successfully counterfeit cards,"" says Julie Conroy, research director for retail banking at Aite Group, a financial industry research company. ""It's an important step forward."" For merchants and financial institutions, the switch to EMV means adding new in-store technology and internal processing systems, and complying with new liability rules. For consumers, it means learning a new payment processes. Want to know more about the ongoing transition and your EMV chip-equipped credit card? Here are eight frequently asked questions to help you understand the changes. 1. Why are EMV cards more secure than traditional cards? It's that small, metallic square you'll see on new cards. That's a computer chip, and it's what sets it apart the new generation of cards. The magnetic stripes on traditional credit and debit cards store contain unchanging data. Whoever accesses that data gains the sensitive card and cardholder information necessary to make purchases. That makes traditional cards prime targets for counterfeiters, who convert stolen card data to cash. ""If someone copies a mag stripe, they can easily replicate that data over and over again because it doesn't change,"" says Dave Witts, president of U.S. payment systems for Creditcall, a payment gateway and EMV software developer. Unlike magnetic-stripe cards, every time an EMV card is used for payment, the card chip creates a unique transaction code that cannot be used again. If a hacker stole the chip information from one specific point of sale, typical card duplication would never work ""because the stolen transaction number created in that instance wouldn't be usable again and the card would just get denied,"" Witts says. EMV technology will not prevent data breaches from occurring, but it will make it much harder for criminals to successfully profit from what they steal. Experts hope it will help significantly reduce fraud in the U.S., which has doubled in the past seven years as criminals have shied away from countries that already have transitioned to EMV cards, Conroy says. ""The introduction of dynamic data is what makes EMV cards so effective at bringing down counterfeit card rates in other countries,"" she says. Counterfeit fraud rates have already decreased in the U.S. as a result of EMV adoption, according to Mastercard and Visa. In March 2017, chip-enabled merchants saw a 58 percent drop in counterfeit fraud compared to a year earlier, according to Visa. Mastercard noticed a difference even earlier: It recorded a 54 percent decrease in counterfeit fraud costs among its EMV-ready merchants from April 2015 to April 2016. How EMV chips are made Microcomputers on your credit cards A look behind the scenes at an ultra-secure credit card factory where small but complex smart card chips are made. Microcomputers on your credit cardsA look behind the scenes at an ultra-secure credit card factory where small but complex smart card chips are made. See more 2. How do I use an EMV card to make a purchase? Just like magnetic-stripe cards, EMV cards are processed for payment in two steps: card reading and transaction verification. However, with EMV cards you no longer have to master a quick, fluid card swipe in the right direction. Chip cards are read in a different way. ""Instead of going to a register and swiping your card, you are going to do what is called 'card dipping' instead, which means inserting your card into a terminal slot and waiting for it to process,"" Conroy says. When an EMV card is dipped, data flows between the card chip and the issuing financial institution to verify the card's legitimacy and create the unique transaction data. This process isn't as quick as a magnetic-stripe swipe. ""It will take a tiny bit longer for that transmission of data to happen,"" Witts says. ""If a person just sticks the card in and pulls it out, the transaction will likely be denied. A little bit of patience will be involved."" While chip card transactions may take a bit longer than mag stripe transactions, total card processing time will vary between merchants and eventually speed up as the new payment environment is improved. It will vary depending on the merchant, the equipment and the point-of-sale system, Ferenczi said. I think that time lag overtime will be reduced for those longer transactions. For more information about current EMV transaction speeds, see The big chip card switch: a year of living with EMV. Wait, what's the card called? The new EMV cards in the U.S. might be called any of the following terms: Smart card Chip card Smart-chip card Chip-enabled smart card Chip-and-choice card (PIN or signature) EMV smart card EMV card 3. Is card dipping the only option? Not necessarily. EMV cards can also support contactless card reading, also known as near field communication. Instead of dipping or swiping, NFC-equipped cards are tapped against a terminal scanner that can pick up the card data from the embedded computer chip. ""Contactless transactions are more consumer-friendly because you just have to tap,"" said Martin Ferenczi, president of Oberthur Technologies, the leading global EMV product and service provider. ""Around the world, there is a move to make EMV cards dual-interface, which means contact and contactless. However, in the U.S., most financial instructions are issuing contact cards."" Dual-interface cards and the equipment needed to scan them are expensive. Right now, the first step is to successfully integrate EMV cards into the U.S. shopping scene. Dual interface will arrive later, although they are in production and rolling out slowly now, according to Ferenczi. Dual-interface cards, which in 2016 represented less than 5 percent of total EMV cards in the U.S., will have significant growth in 2017, Ferenczi said. Issuers want to offer their cardholders the added level of speed and convenience provided by tapping. 4. Will I still have to sign or enter a PIN for my card transaction? Yes and no. You will have to do one of those verification methods, but it depends on the verification method tied to your EMV card, not if your card is debit or credit. Chip-and-PIN cards operate just like the checking-account debit card you have been using for years. Entering a PIN connects the payment terminal to the payment processor for real-time transaction verification and approval. However, many payment processors are not equipped with the technology needed to handle EMV chip-and-PIN credit transactions. So it is not likely you will have to memorize new PINs anytime soon, according to Conroy. ""There aren't going to be many issuers requiring a PIN,"" she says. ""A vast majority will be issuing chip-and-signature cards, which aren't all that different from how credit cards work now."" As with a magnetic-stripe credit card, you sign on the point-of-sale terminal to take responsibility for the payment when making a chip-and-signature card transaction. U.S. chip-and-PIN cards will be transitioned in slowly, according to Ferenczi. ""The card production demand today is really based on chip-and-signature cards,"" he says. ""It will probably take two to three years to fully convert to chip-and-PIN."" Despite a slow transition overall, those who get chip-and-PIN cards will be able to use them right away. ""If a terminal doesn't have the ability to accept a PIN, it will then step down to accepting a signature,"" says Randy Vanderhoof, executive director of the Smart Card Alliance. ""There will always be a secondary option."" Chip cards, by the numbers The Numbers 855 million: Estimated number of chip cards issued to U.S. consumers so far, per U.S. Payments Forum estimates 85%: Estimated percentage of all U.S. credit cards issued with chips at the end of July 2017, per CPI Card Group 60%: Percentage of U.S. debit cards issued with chips by the end of July 2017, per CPI Card Group $2-$4: Approximately cost of issuing a new EMV card, per First Data 15 million: Estimated total number of point-of-sale terminals that have to be upgraded to accept chip cards, per Javelin Research & Strategy $6.75 billion: Estimated cost of replacing the 15 million POS terminals with chip card-compliant machines, per Javelin Research & Strategy 50-52%: Estimated percentage of merchant locations currently ready to process chip card payments, per Visa, U.S. Payments Forum and Strawhecker Group estimates 1.81-2.3 million: Estimated number of U.S. point-of-sale terminals enabled to accept chip card payments, per Mastercard and Visa estimates. 5. If fraud occurs after EMV cards are issued, who will be liable for the costs? If an in-store transaction is conducted using a counterfeit, stolen or otherwise compromised card, consumer losses from that transaction fall back on the payment processor or issuing bank, depending on the card's terms and conditions. Since the Oct. 1, 2015 deadline created by major U.S. credit card issuers Mastercard, Visa, Discover and American Express, the liability for card-present fraud has shifted to whichever party is the least EMV-compliant in a fraudulent transaction. Consider the example of a financial institution that issues a chip card used at a merchant that has not changed its system to accept chip technology. This allows a counterfeit card to be successfully used. ""The cost of the fraud will fall back on the merchant,"" Ferenczi says. The change is intended to help bring the entire payment industry on board with EMV by encouraging compliance to avoid liability costs. Today, any parties not EMV-ready could face much higher costs in the event of a large data breach. Until recently, automated fuel dispensers had until 2017 to make the shift to EMV. However, a December 2016 Visa and Mastercard agreement now gives pay-at-the-pump gas terminals until October 2020 to become EMV-compliant. Given the migration challenges for implementing EMV in the petroleum environment, Visa's and Mastercards modification of the liability shift dates will be beneficial to the retail petroleum industry and the U.S. chip migration, Vanderhoof explained in an emailed statement. So for now, gas stations do not fall under the existing EMV fraud liability shift rules. ATMs still have two fraud liability shift dates: Mastercards that passed in October 2016 and Visas in October 2017. Until both dates pass, ATMs will follow existing fraud liability rulings. See ATMs changing to accept EMV chip cards for more ATM migration information. 6. So since Oct. 1, 2015, is the transition to EMV technology complete? Not yet. Although the deadline was strong encouragement for all payment processing parties to become EMV-compliant as soon as possible, not everyone has made the transition yet. Most countries that migrated to EMV have four or five banks that issue cards and a couple of acquirers that provide a service to merchants, said Jason Oxman, chief executive officer of the Electronic Transactions Association. We have 13,000 financial institutions in the U.S. that issue credit and debit cards, and we have 5 million merchant locations in the U.S. that accept debit and credit cards. So its a massive undertaking. EMV debit cards have rolled out at a slower pace. Approximately 25 percent of U.S. debit cards were issued as EMV chip cards by the end of 2015, according to Mercator Advisory Groups Sarah Grotta, director of Debit Advisory Service. That ratio rose to 33 percent by the end of June 2016, and today, approximately 60 percent of issuer's debit cards are EMV chip-equipped, according to CPI Card Group estimates. EMV debit cards are slowly being issued because banks have to prep their software to accept those new cards as well, according to Ferenczi. The majority of chip cards in the hands of cardholders today have come from larger issuers auch as Bank of America and Chase, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. The cost of this EMV transition is causing smaller banks to convert their cards more slowly. The EMV credit card rollout, however, is progressing steadily. More than 449 million Visa chip cards have been issued in the U.S. overall so far, as of June 2017. About 68 percent of Mastercard-branded credit and debit cards have been issued with chips so far, as of Oct. 1, 2016. For all U.S. credit cards, CPI Card Group estimates approximately 85 percent of cards now have chips on them. Overall, 70 percent of cards (debit and credit) have been converted to EMV, per CPI Card Group. If some of the cards in your wallet have yet to be issued with chips, don't fret. ""Different companies have different rollout strategies,"" says Doug Johnson, vice president of risk management policy for the American Bankers Association. Some will base their actions on card expiration dates; others will work to get chip cards into the consumer's hands as soon as possible. I think the progress we are seeing today is promising, said Chiro Aikat, senior vice president of product delivery (EMV) at Mastercard. What about mobile payment readers? EMV-compatible card readers for Android and iOS devices that can read contactless mobile payments and process dipped chip cards. Merchants can purchase the devices for $49. 7. If I want to use my chip-card at a retailer that doesn't support EMV technology yet, will it work? Yes. The first round of EMV cards -- many of which are in consumers' hands -- will be equipped with both chip and magnetic-stripe functions so consumer spending is not disrupted and merchants can adjust. If you find yourself at a point-of-sale terminal and are not sure whether to dip or swipe your card, have no fear. The terminal will walk you through the process. ""For example, if you enter a card into the chip reader slot but the reader isn't activated yet, it will come up with an error and you'll be prompted to swipe the card in order to use it,"" Vanderhoof says. And vice-versa. ""If a consumer tries to swipe a chip card instead of inserting it, an error will appear and they will be prompted to insert the card for chip processing instead,"" Vanderhoof says. If chip-card readers are not in place at a merchant at all, your EMV card can be read with a swipe, just like a traditional magnetic-stripe card. ""You can still conduct transactions, you just lose that extra level of chip security,"" Johnson says. See Mag stripe begins its farewell tour for details about the move away from magnetic stripe cards. While many large retailers, such as Walmart, Target and Costco, have upgraded their POS terminals and have activated them for chip card acceptance, many U.S. retail locations are still not EMV-ready. Visa says 50 percent of U.S. stores (approximately 2.3 million merchant locations) now accept chip cards, as of June 2017. Mastercard has tallied 2.3 million chip-active merchant locations on its network, representing 38 percent of all U.S. merchants back in October 2016. Industry experts expect the merchant migration to slowly continue over the next few years, especially as the remaining liability shift dates get closer. I expect to see a slow and gradual increase of merchant moving over, just like weve seen up until today, as each merchant makes an assessment if this expenditure makes sense for them and their particular business, said Mallory Duncan, senior vice president and general counsel at the National Retail Federation. In July 2017, U.S. Payments Forum estimated 45 to 50 percent of U.S. credit and debit card transactions were chip-on-chip. See ""7 merchant tips to understanding EMV fraud liability shift"" for answers to additional liability shift questions. 8. Will I be able to use my EMV card when I travel outside the country? Yes and no. The U.S. is the last major market still using the magnetic-stripe card system. Many European countries moved to EMV technology years ago to combat high fraud rates. That shift has left many U.S. consumers who have magnetic-stripe cards looking for other forms of payment when they travel. Since many foreign merchants are wary of magnetic-stripe cards, consumers who hold some type of chip card may run into fewer issues than those without one, according to Ferenczi. ""Just the existence of the chip will likely make European merchants more willing to accept transactions that they wouldn't have likely accepted if a customer presented a mag-stripe card,"" he say, which is good news for traveling U.S. cardholders. However, chip-and-PIN cards are the norm in most other countries that support EMV technology. So consumers with chip-and-signature cards may find some merchants who are unwilling or unable to process their card, even though it does have an embedded chip. But despite any difficulties in the transition, Ferenczi says the change is a step in the right direction. ""Nobody likes to think that his or her card is being secretly used for other purposes,"" he says. ""So I think regardless, there is a level of comfort knowing that it will be far more difficult to counterfeit EMV cards.""

12291,Is Your Semen Volume Normal? Here's How to Tell.,"Is your semen volume normal? If you're producing less than a third of a teaspoon, it might be time to get checked for underlying health problems Low semen volume could be a sign of health issues like low testosterone or diabetes. Some of the causes of low semen volume are treatable, so don't be afraid to bring up the topic with your doctor. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Of course youve measured your penis to see how your member matches up, but youve probably never taken the steps to actually quantify how your after-sex eruptions compare to those of other dudes. But still, it might have crossed your mind: Is the amount youre ejaculating normal? Lots of guys worry about whether the volume of their ejaculate is cause for concern, says Daniel Williams, M.D., an associate professor in the department of urology and director of male reproductive medicine and microsurgery at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. According to parameters developed by the World Health Organization Even if your eruptions dont quite hit that benchmark, you still might be perfectly normal. But if youre only producing 1.5 ml or less of the sticky stuff  less than one-third of a teaspoon  thats when you may need further evaluation. Levels under that  or having a noticeable change  can raise your suspicion that a man may have an underlying issue thats contributing to the low volume of his ejaculate, Dr. Williams says. Is low semen volume definitely a problem? Just as erectile function declines with age, ejaculation volume generally follows a similar course, Dr. Williams says. So if youve been noticing a gradual decrease in the amount that youre spurting, say, over the last 5 or 10 years, it might just be a normal, age-related decline. And this can actually start in any decade of life. In some men, it can start in their 20s and 30s, but most men may not notice any changes until later on, he says. Whats more concerning is if you notice a sudden difference in the amount you ejaculate. This can signal something else is going on. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Getty Images What causes low semen volume? There are a number of underlying conditions that can result in a low ejaculation volume. Youre probably familiar with something called hypogonadism, the official term for low testosterone. Along with making it hard to, well, get hard, low T can also decrease the amount of ejaculate youre producing. You may also feel nonspecific symptoms like fatigue, weakness, or trouble concentrating  all factors that should prompt your doc to check you for low testosterone, Dr. Williams says. Other sneaky signs of low T include your sex drive disappearing and your penis, scrotum, and testicles shrinking. Getty Images Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Advertisement - Continue Reading Below One condition you may not have thought about, though, is diabetes. If your blood sugar has been haywire for a while, it can damage the nerves and your blood vessels. This can make it harder for the nerve signals to communicate, which may result in erectile dysfunction and ejaculation problems. Diabetics are also more likely to develop a surprising condition called retrograde ejaculation, where the semen spurts back into the bladder instead of out the tip of the penis. Other neurological problems, such as multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injuries, can also cause low semen volume in a similar way. You may also notice a decrease in the volume of your ejaculations if you have an enlarged prostate, take meds like alpha blockers  which treat high blood pressure or urinary problems  or if youve recently had an abdominal surgery. Getty Advertisement - Continue Reading Below What should you do if you think your semen volume has dropped? Feeling like youre dribbling when you should be dousing can throw any guy for a loop. In fact, according to a recent Brazilian study, men who were unsatisfied with the amount of their ejaculate scored lower on measures of psychological and relationship health than guys who were unconcerned with it. Some men do identify with their sexual function and perceive their ejaculatory function as sort of a marker of their virility, or a mark of their manliness, Dr. Williams says. If they see that their sexual function has diminished, that can impact other domains of their lives. Getty So its not something you should stress about silently. If you notice a significant decrease in the volume of your ejaculation, its a good idea to make an appointment with a urologist so you can be evaluated for ejaculatory dysfunction, Dr. Williams says. This may include tests for some of the potential causes, such as low testosterone or diabetes. Your doc will also evaluate your medical and surgical history to see if any conditions or medications may be contributing to your low semen volume. Treating the causes of low semen volume So you've found the culprit behind your low semen volume. The next step is taking care of it, if possible. Some of the causes of low semen volume can be treated, like low testosterone.

12362,Monsanto Buys Whole Foods: Fact or Rumor?,"Since early 2011, there has been a lot of information circulating regarding Monsantos purported purchasing of the natural health food store known as Whole Foods; topics like Monsanto buys whole foods and others quickly became hot search terms. Interestingly enough, Monsanto was also rumored to have bought Blackwater (Xe), a private military company. While it is understandable that Monsanto would buy or at least work with Blackwater (as they are both in the same corrupt business), who would believe that Monsanto could scoop up Whole Foods? In actuality, the biotechnology giant did not buy Blackwater, and did not buy Whole Foods. Here are the details. Monsanto Buys Whole Foods? It all started in early 2011, when the USDA finally made the decision to deregulate genetically modified alfalfa without restrictions  a decision which caused many individuals, companies, and farmers to become very upset. Before the decision was made, the USDA was considering two options which they would present to the industry: to fully deregulate the alfalfa or to deregulate it with restrictions. Unfortunately, there was no option presented to the industry by the USDA for an outright ban on GM alfalfa, so Whole Foods went with the better option available. Whole Foods Market advocated strongly for deregulation with restrictions to preserve the ability of non-GE and organic growers to avoid contamination. It seemed that the USDA was finally recognizing that cross-contamination of GE alfalfa could potentially impact organic and non-GE farmers and consumers, both domestically and for our export marketsUnfortunately, the USDAs decision fell far short of this mark, and we believe that unrestricted planting of GE alfalfa without setting any clear coexistence framework, with thresholds for contamination and providing for ongoing testing and verification, is irresponsible, states a post on the Whole Foods website. Many people have asked us why we endorsed the coexistence option rather than an outright ban on GE alfalfa. That was never an option in Washington!..the option of an outright ban was not on the table, the post on the Whole Foods website said. Whole Foods Market  along with the National Cooperative Grocers Association, the National Organic Coalition, the Organic Trade Association, and other companies and groups  endorsed the path of deregulation with restrictions, or coexistence, not because it was a perfect path, but because it was a path to create meaningful change right now in the regulating of genetically engineered foods and the protection of non-GE foods.  Since Whole Foods supported the USDAs approach of coexistence, some consumer groups said the company started supporting GM foods, but along with the Monsanto buys Whole Foods rumors, this also wasnt true. The Organic Consumer Associations (OCA) released a rather misleading article titled Whole Foods Caves to Monsanto in 2011, which was the start of Monsanto buys Whole Foods rumors. No! What crazy talk! Weve never had any affiliation with that company. We are publicly traded; our majority shareholders are listed in documents filed with the SEC and, I promise, Monsanto is not on the list and never has beenYou see, Whole Foods Market and others in the organic food industry met with the US Secretary of Agriculture in support of farmers rights to grow Non-GMO crops. Because we did not take the exact hard-line stance that the OCA did, they accused us of being in bed with Monsanto' said a Whole Foods employee.

13776,NEW WORLD COMMUNICATIONS OF TAMPA INC WTVT TV v. AKRE,"District Court of Appeal of Florida,Second District. NEW WORLD COMMUNICATIONS OF TAMPA, INC., d/b/a WTVT-TV, Appellant, v. Jane AKRE, Appellee. No. 2D01-529. Decided: February 14, 2003 William E. McDaniels and Thomas G. Hentoff of Williams & Connolly LLP, Washington, DC, Patricia Fields Anderson, P.A., St. Petersburg, and Gary D. Roberts and Theodore A. Russell of Fox Group Legal Department, Los Angeles, CA, for Appellant. Michael S. Finch, St. Petersburg, and Stuart C. Markman, Robert W. Ritsch, and Katherine Earle Yanes of Kynes, Markman & Felman, P.A., Tampa, for Appellee. Roy C. Young of Young, vanAssenderp, Varnadoe & Anderson, P.A., Tallahassee, for Amicus Curiae The Florida Chamber of Commerce. Robert Corn-Revere and Brad C. Deutsch of Hogan & Hartson, LLP, Washington, DC, for Amicus Curiae Belo Corp., Cox Television, Inc., Gannett Co., Inc., Media General Operations, Inc., and Post-Newsweek Stations, Inc. New World Communications of Tampa, Inc., d/b/a WTVT-TV, a subsidiary of Fox Television, challenges a judgment entered against it for violating Florida's private sector whistle-blower's statute, section 448.102, Florida Statutes (Supp.1998). We reverse. In December 1996, WTVT hired the appellee, Jane Akre, and her husband, Steve Wilson, as a husband-and-wife investigative reporting team. Shortly after Akre and Wilson arrived at WTVT, they began working on a story about the use of synthetic bovine growth hormone (BGH) in Florida dairy cattle. Their work on this story led to what could be characterized as an eight-month tug-of-war between the reporters and WTVT's management and lawyers over the content of the story. Each time the station asked Wilson and Akre to provide supporting documentation for statements in the story or to make changes in the content of the story, the reporters accused the station of attempting to distort the story to favor the manufacturer of BGH. In September 1997, WTVT notified Akre and Wilson that it was exercising its option to terminate their employment contracts without cause. Akre and Wilson responded in writing to WTVT threatening to file a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) alleging that the station had illegally edited the still unfinished BGH report in violation of an FCC policy against federally licensed broadcasters deliberately distorting the news. The parties never resolved their differences regarding the content of the story, and consequently, the story never aired. In April 1998, Akre and Wilson sued WTVT alleging, among other things, claims under the whistle-blower's statute. Those claims alleged that their terminations had been in retaliation for their resisting WTVT's attempts to distort or suppress the BGH story and for threatening to report the alleged news distortion to the FCC. Akre also brought claims for declaratory relief and for breach of contract. After a four-week trial, a jury found against Wilson on all of his claims. The trial court directed a verdict against Akre on her breach of contract claim, Akre abandoned her claim for declaratory relief, and the trial court let her whistle-blower claims go to the jury. The jury rejected all of Akre's claims except her claim that WTVT retaliated against her in response to her threat to disclose the alleged news distortion to the FCC. The jury awarded Akre $425,000 in damages. While WTVT has raised a number of challenges to the judgment obtained by Akre, we need not address each challenge because we find as a threshold matter that Akre failed to state a claim under the whistle-blower's statute. The portion of the whistle-blower's statute pertinent to this appeal prohibits retaliation against employees who have [d]isclosed, or threatened to disclose, employer conduct that is in violation of a law, rule, or regulation.  448.102(1)(3). The statute defines a law, rule or regulation as includ[ing] any statute or  any rule or regulation adopted pursuant to any federal, state, or local statute or ordinance applicable to the employer and pertaining to the business.  448.101(4), Fla. Stat. (1997). We agree with WTVT that the FCC's policy against the intentional falsification of the news-which the FCC has called its news distortion policy-does not qualify as the required law, rule, or regulation under section 448.102. The FCC has never published its news distortion policy as a regulation with definitive elements and defenses. Instead, the FCC has developed the policy through the adjudicatory process in decisions resolving challenges to broadcasters' licenses. The policy's roots can be traced to 1949 when the FCC first expressed its concern regarding deceptive news in very general terms stating that [a] licensee would be abusing his position as a public trustee of these important means of mass communications were he to withhold from expression over his facilities relevant news of facts concerning a controversy or to slant or distort the news. See Chad Raphael, The FCC's Broadcast News Distortion Rules: Regulation by Drooping Eyelid, 6 Comm. L. & Policy 485, 494 (2001) (quoting Editorializing by Broadcast Licensees, 13 F.C.C. 1246, 1246 (1949)). The policy did not begin to take shape, however, until 1969 when the FCC was called upon to investigate complaints regarding news distortion. Raphael at 494. Notably, the FCC did not take the initiative to investigate these complaints, but rather acted only after Congress referred complaints it had received to the FCC. In a series of opinions issued in licensing proceedings between 1969 and 1973, the FCC stated that when considering the status of a broadcaster's license, it would take into consideration proven instances of deliberate news distortion, also called intentional falsification of the news or rigging or slanting the news. In re CBS Program Hunger in America, 20 F.C.C.2d 143, 150-51 (1969). This series of FCC opinions has come to be known as the FCC's news distortion policy. Akre argues that the FCC's policy is a rule as defined by section 120.52(15), Florida Statutes (1997), which provides: Rule means each agency statement of general applicability that implements, interprets, or prescribes law or policy or describes the procedure or practice requirements of an agency and includes any form which imposes any requirement or solicits any information not specifically required by statute or by an existing rule. Even if we agreed with Akre that the FCC's news distortion policy was a rule as defined by section 120.52(15), her argument overlooks the fact that the whistle-blower's statute specifically limits the definition of rule to an adopted rule.  448.101(4). This limitation to adopted material only appears deliberate, and well serves the public by hinging civil liability upon matters of which due notice, actual or imputed, has been conveyed. Forrester v. John B. Phipps, Inc., 643 So.2d 1109 (Fla. 1st DCA 1994). We find the legislature's use of the word adopted in the statute to be a limitation on the scope of conduct that will subject an employer to liability under the statute. It is undisputed that the FCC's news distortion policy has never been adopted as defined by section 120.54, Florida Statutes (1997). In that regard, Akre notes that federal agencies may announce general policies and interpretive principles through the adjudicative process and argues that the fact that the FCC adopted the news distortion policy through an adjudicative process does not affect its validity or enforceability as a matter of federal law. This argument is flawed in two respects. First, federal law recognizes a dichotomy between rulemaking and adjudication; it does not equate the two. See Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 109 S.Ct. 468, 102 L.Ed.2d 493 (1988) (Scalia, J., concurring). Second, while federal agencies may have discretion to formulate policy through the adjudicative process, the same is not true under Florida law. The Florida Legislature has limited state agencies' discretion to formulate policy through the adjudicative process by requiring agencies to formally adopt each agency statement that fits the definition of a rule under section 120.52. See  120.54. As noted above, the legislature's use of the word adopted in the whistle-blower's statute was deliberate and was intended to limit the scope of conduct that will subject an employer to liability. This limitation is consistent with the legislature's requirement that agency statements that fit the definition of a rule be formally adopted. Recognizing an uncodified agency policy developed through the adjudicative process as the equivalent of a formally adopted rule is not consistent with this policy, and it would expand the scope of conduct that could subject an employer to liability beyond what Florida's Legislature could have contemplated when it enacted the whistle-blower's statute. Because the FCC's news distortion policy is not a law, rule, or regulation under section 448.102, Akre has failed to state a claim under the whistle-blower's statute. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment in her favor and remand for entry of a judgment in favor of WTVT. Reversed and remanded. ORDER ON APPELLEE'S MOTION FOR REHEARING, MOTION FOR CLARIFICATION, MOTION FOR REHEARING EN BANC, AND MOTION FOR CERTIFICATION OF QUESTION OF GREAT PUBLIC IMPORTANCE. This court entered an order granting appellate attorney's fees to the appellant, New World Communications of Tampa, Inc., d/b/a WTVT-TV, a subsidiary of Fox Television. Thereafter, the appellee, Jane Akre, sought rehearing, clarification, rehearing en banc, and certification of a question of great public importance. We grant Akre's requests for rehearing and clarification and deny her requests for rehearing en banc and certification. WTVT appealed a final judgment entered against it for violating Florida's private sector whistle-blower's statute, section 448.102, Florida Statutes (1997). The final judgment was entered pursuant to a jury verdict awarding Akre $425,000 in damages. We reversed after concluding that Akre had failed to state a claim under the whistle-blower's statute. We also granted WTVT's motion for appellate attorney's fees under section 448.104, Florida Statutes (1997), which states, [a] court may award reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and expenses to the prevailing party. In her motion for rehearing, Akre argues that because section 448.104 authorizes an award of attorney's fees to prevailing defendants as well as to prevailing plaintiffs, this court should apply the standard articulated in Christiansburg Garment Co. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 434 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978). In Christiansburg, the Court had to determine the proper standard for an award of attorney's fees to a prevailing defendant in an action brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII gives courts discretion to award fees to the prevailing party, as does section 448.104, but it does not give any indication of when a court should award fees to a prevailing plaintiff or a prevailing defendant. The Christiansburg Court concluded that equitable considerations embodied in Title VII justified applying different standards depending on whether the prevailing party was a plaintiff or a defendant. The Court found that while fees should be awarded to every prevailing plaintiff unless special circumstances would make such an award unjust, fees should only be awarded to a prevailing defendant when the plaintiff's action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation. Christiansburg, 434 U.S. at 420. We do not agree with Akre's contention that this same standard should apply to an action brought under Florida's whistle-blower's statute. We are not persuaded that the reasons cited by the Christiansburg Court for applying different standards to prevailing plaintiffs and defendants apply to cases brought under section 448.103. To the extent that this question has been addressed by other courts, they have likewise concluded that the Christiansburg standard is not applicable to fee awards under section 448.104. See Gamb v. Hilton Hotels Corp., No. 95-466-CIV-ORL-19, 1997 WL 893874 (M.D.Fla. Sept.26, 1997), aff'd, 132 F.3d 46 (11th Cir.1997); McGregor v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 130 F.R.D. 464 (S.D.Fla.1990), aff'd, 956 F.2d 1017 (11th Cir.1992). Nevertheless, because section 448.104 is not mandatory, we must consider whether to exercise our discretion and make such an award in this case. Under the circumstances of this appeal, we conclude that WTVT is not entitled to appellate attorney's fees. Akre came to this court as an appellee defending a final judgment entered in her favor at the conclusion of a jury trial. We do not believe that it is either realistic or good policy to require an appellee who has obtained a favorable jury verdict to abandon it on appeal or risk an award of attorney's fees if it is reversed. We reach this conclusion even though the whistle-blower aspect of Akre's case was without legal merit from its inception. This court has held that because all final judgments have a presumption of correctness, attempting to uphold one is not frivolous. Cf. Dep't of Highway Safety & Motor Vehicles v. Salter, 710 So.2d 1039 (Fla. 2d DCA 1998). Accordingly, even the lack of legal merit in Akre's position does not convince us that we should exercise our discretion to award appellate attorney's fees to WTVT. We emphasize that we are only considering the issue of a proper exercise of discretion for an award of appellate attorney's fees. On remand, the trial court will have to make its own determination regarding whether to award trial court attorney's fees to WTVT as the prevailing party. To be entitled to such an award, however, WTVT does not have to demonstrate that Akre's suit was frivolous. No further motions for rehearing will be entertained. FOOTNOTES . We are aware of the Fourth District's decision in Forum v. Boca Burger, Inc., 788 So.2d 1055 (Fla. 4th DCA 2001), review granted, 817 So.2d 844 (Fla.2002). We have concluded that it is not pertinent to our decision because Salter still represents this district's position regarding whether defense of a judgment on appeal can ever be considered frivolous. Additionally, we find nothing in Forum that expressly repudiates that principle, which was the law in the Fourth District when Forum was decided. See Coral Springs Roofing Co. v. Campagna, 528 So.2d 557 (Fla. 4th DCA 1988). Rather, the holding in Forum is directed to the proper construction of a 1999 amendment to section 57.105, Florida Statutes, that the Fourth District concluded broadened the circumstances under which a fee award could be made under that statute.

13837,Hebrew numerals,"The system of Hebrew numerals is a quasi-decimal alphabetic numeral system using the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The system was adapted from that of the Greek numerals in the late 2nd century BC. The current numeral system is also known as the Hebrew alphabetic numerals to contrast with earlier systems of writing numerals used in classical antiquity. These systems were inherited from usage in the Aramaic and Phoenician scripts, attested from c. 800 BC in the so-called Samaria ostraca and sometimes known as Hebrew-Aramaic numerals, ultimately derived from the Egyptian Hieratic numerals. The Greek system was adopted in Hellenistic Judaism and had been in use in Greece since about the 5th century BC. [1] In this system, there is no notation for zero, and the numeric values for individual letters are added together. Each unit (1, 2, ..., 9) is assigned a separate letter, each tens (10, 20, ..., 90) a separate letter, and the first four hundreds (100, 200, 300, 400) a separate letter. The later hundreds (500, 600, 700, 800 and 900) are represented by the sum of two or three letters representing the first four hundreds. To represent numbers from 1,000 to 999,999, the same letters are reused to serve as thousands, tens of thousands, and hundreds of thousands. Gematria (Jewish numerology) uses these transformations extensively. In Israel today, the decimal system of Arabic numerals (ex. 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.) is used in almost all cases (money, age, date on the civil calendar). The Hebrew numerals are used only in special cases, such as when using the Hebrew calendar, or numbering a list (similar to a, b, c, d, etc.), much as Roman numerals are used in the West. Numbers [ edit ] The Hebrew language has names for common numbers that range from zero to one million. Letters of the Hebrew alphabet are used to represent numbers in a few traditional contexts, for example in calendars. In other situations Arabic numerals are used. Cardinal and ordinal numbers must agree in gender with the noun they are describing. If there is no such noun (e.g. telephone numbers), the feminine form is used. For ordinal numbers greater than ten the cardinal is used and numbers above the value 20 have no gender. Early 20th century pocket watches with Hebrew numerals in clockwise order ( Jewish Museum, Berlin ). Ordinal values [ edit ] Ordinal (English) Ordinal (Hebrew) Masculine Feminine First (rishon)  (rishona)  Second (sheni)  (shniya)  Third (shlishi)  (shlishit)  Fourth (revi'i)  (revi'it)  Fifth (chamishi)  (chamishit)  Sixth (shishi)  (shishit)  Seventh (shvi'i)  (shvi'it)  Eighth (shmini)  (shminit)  Ninth (tshi'i)  (tshi'it)  Tenth ('asiri)  ('asirit)  Note: For ordinal numbers greater than 10, cardinal numbers are used instead. Cardinal Values [ edit ] Note: For numbers greater than 20, gender does not apply. Officially, numbers greater than million were represented by the long scale; However, since January 21st, 2013, the modified short scale (under which the long scale milliard is substituted for the strict short scale billion), which was already the colloquial standard, became official.[2] Speaking and writing [ edit ] Cardinal and ordinal numbers must agree in gender (masculine or feminine; mixed groups are treated as masculine) with the noun they are describing. If there is no such noun (e.g. a telephone number or a house number in a street address), the feminine form is used. Ordinal numbers must also agree in number and definite status like other adjectives. The cardinal number precedes the noun (e.g., shlosha yeladim), except for the number one which succeeds it (e.g., yeled echad). The number two is special: shnayim (m.) and shtayim (f.) become shney (m.) and shtey (f.) when followed by the noun they count. For ordinal numbers (numbers indicating position) greater than ten the cardinal is used. Calculations [ edit ] The Hebrew numeric system operates on the additive principle in which the numeric values of the letters are added together to form the total. For example, 177 is represented as  which (from right to left) corresponds to 100 + 70 + 7 = 177. Mathematically, this type of system requires 27 letters (1-9, 10-90, 100-900). In practice the last letter, tav (which has the value 400) is used in combination with itself and/or other letters from kof (100) onwards, to generate numbers from 500 and above. Alternatively, the 22-letter Hebrew numeral set is sometimes extended to 27 by using 5 sofit (final) forms of the Hebrew letters.[3] Key exceptions [ edit ] By convention, the numbers 15 and 16 are represented as  (9 + 6) and  (9 + 7), respectively, in order to refrain from using the two-letter combinations - (10 + 5) and - (10 + 6), which are alternate written forms for the Name of God in everyday writing. In the calendar, this manifests every full moon, since all Hebrew months start on a new moon (see for example: Tu BiShvat). Combinations which would spell out words with negative connotations are sometimes avoided by switching the order of the letters. For instance, 744 which should be written as  (meaning ""you/it will be destroyed"") might instead be written as  or  (meaning ""end to demon""). Use of final letters [ edit ] The Hebrew numeral system has sometimes been extended to include the five final letter forms (500),  (600),  (700),  (800),  (900)which are then used to indicate the numbers from 500 to 900. The ordinary forms for 500 to 900 are (500),  (600),  (700),  (800),  (900) Gershayim [ edit ]            Passed away on day 20 Iyar And buried on day 23 Iyar Year 695 without the thousands [i.e. year 5695] Note the dots above each letter in each number. A tombstone from 1935 in Baiersdorf Germany , reading:In English:Note the dots above each letter in each number. Gershayim (U+05F4 in Unicode, and resembling a double quote mark) (sometimes erroneously referred to as merkha'ot, which is Hebrew for double quote) are inserted before (to the right of) the last (leftmost) letter to indicate that the sequence of letters represents a number rather than a word. This is used in the case where a number is represented by two or more Hebrew numerals (e.g., 28  ). Similarly, a single Geresh (U+05F3 in Unicode, and resembling a single quote mark) is appended after (to the left of) a single letter to indicate that the letter represents a number rather than a (one-letter) word. This is used in the case where a number is represented by a single Hebrew numeral (e.g., 100  ). Note that Geresh and Gershayim merely indicate ""not a (normal) word."" Context usually determines whether they indicate a number or something else (such as ""abbreviation""). An alternative method found in old manuscripts and still found on modern-day tombstones is to put a dot above each letter of the number. Decimals [ edit ] In print, Arabic numerals are employed in Modern Hebrew for most purposes. Hebrew numerals are used nowadays primarily for writing the days and years of the Hebrew calendar; for references to traditional Jewish texts (particularly for Biblical chapter and verse and for Talmudic folios); for bulleted or numbered lists (similar to A, B, C, etc., in English); and in numerology (gematria). Thousands are counted separately, and the thousands count precedes the rest of the number (to the right, since Hebrew is read from right to left). There are no special marks to signify that the count is starting over with thousands, which can theoretically lead to ambiguity, although a single quote mark is sometimes used after the letter. When specifying years of the Hebrew calendar in the present millennium, writers usually omit the thousands (which is presently 5 []), but if they do not this is accepted to mean 5 * 1000, with no ambiguity. The current Israeli coinage includes the thousands.[clarification needed] Monday, 15 Adar 5764 (where 5764 = 5(1000) + 400 + 300 + 60 + 4, and 15 = 9 + 6): In full (with thousands): Monday, 15(th) of Adar, 5764      Common usage (omitting thousands): Monday, 15(th) of Adar, (5)764      Thursday, 3 Nisan 5767 (where 5767 = 5(1000) + 400 + 300 + 60 + 7): In full (with thousands): Thursday, 3(rd) of Nisan, 5767      Common usage (omitting thousands): Thursday, 3(rd) of Nisan, (5)767      To see how today's date in the Hebrew calendar is written, see, for example, Hebcal date converter. Recent years [ edit ] 5780 (201920) =  5779 (201819) =  ... 5772 (201112) =  5771 (201011) =  5770 (200910) =  5769 (200809) =  ... 5761 (200001) =  5760 (199900) =  Similar systems [ edit ] The Abjad numerals are equivalent to the Hebrew numerals up to 400. The Greek numerals differ from the Hebrew ones from 90 upwards because in the Greek alphabet there is no equivalent for Tsadi ().

86,Ohio Has the Highest Payday Loan Prices in the Nation,"Nationwide, Americans in all demographic groups use payday loans. The only requirements to obtain such credit are a checking account and a source of income. Typical borrowers earn about $30,000 per year, and most use the loans to cover recurring expenses such as rent, mortgage payments, groceries, and utilities.1 Payday loans in Ohio are the countrys most expensive, with a typical annual percentage rate (APR) of 591 percent.2 Lenders charge higher prices in Ohio than in any neighboring state. Distressing signals 1 in 10 adults in Ohioroughly 1 million peoplehas taken out a payday loan. 3 No payday or auto title lenders are licensed under the Short-Term Loan Act, which passed the Ohio Legislature with bipartisan support in 2008 and was an attempt to curb payday loan rates. The industry then tried to get Ohio voters to repeal the legislative action. When that effort failed, lenders circumvented the law by obtaining licenses to operate as credit service organizations, which are not subject to fee limits. 4 Ohios market consists of more than 650 payday loan storefronts in 76 counties, more than 90 percent of which are owned and operated by companies that also do business in other states. 5 Payday loans in Ohio have unnecessarily high prices: Borrowers are charged up to four times what their peers pay in other states.6 (See Table 1.) Ohio can balance affordability and access to credit In 2010, Colorado lawmakers replaced conventional two-week payday loans with six-month installment payday loans at lower prices. Each year, borrowers in that state save more than $40 million, which goes back into the states economy. 7 After reform, access to credit remains widely available in Colorado. 8 An average loan payment consumes 4 percent of a borrowers next paycheck. 9 Borrowers have a pathway out of debt, and 75 percent of loans are repaid early. 10 With similarly sensible reforms, Ohio policymakers can reduce costs for their constituents, creating affordability for borrowers and a viable market for lenders. Federal rules are not enough to protect Ohioans Nationally, borrowers overwhelmingly want reform, with 8 in 10 favoring requirements that payments take up only a small amount of a borrowers paycheck with more time to repay the loan. 11 The federal agency that sets rules for these loans, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has proposed a requirement that lenders review borrowers credit reports and evaluate their debt obligations before making loans. 12 Under this requirement, however, the 400 and 500 percent APR payday and auto title loans that are on the market today would still be allowed in Ohio. Further, Ohios market has begun shifting to longer-term payday installment loans with similarly high APRs and unaffordable payments. 13 The Ohio General Assembly has the power to license and set reasonable terms for these loans; the federal agency does not.

165,"Starbucks CEO: If You Support Traditional Marriage, We Dont Want Your Business | From the Trenches World Report","World Events and the Bible At the Starbucks annual shareholders meeting on Wednesday, CEO Howard Schultz sent a clear message to anyone who supports traditional marriageover gay marriage: we dont want your business. After saying Starbucks wants to embrace diversity of all kinds, he told a shareholder who supports traditional marriage that he should sell his shares and invest in some other company. According to a report by Forbes, Schultz seemed a bit intolerant of any Starbucks shareholders who opposed gay marriage for moral or religious reasons. During the meeting, shareholder Tom Strobhar (who founded the Corporate Morality Action Center) pointed out that after the company voiced its support for a referendum backing gay marriage in Washington state, a boycott by traditional marriage supporters caused a drop in sales revenue. Schultz told him You can sell your shares in Starbucks and buy shares in another company if he did not agree with the companys pro-gay marriage stand. Despite strong opposition from the religious and political right, support for gay marriage in America has risen in recent years. The rise of support for gay marriage has also seen a rise of intolerance for those who oppose it. Many who joined the boycott of Starbucks last yearwere dismissed as bigots, even though the boycott did cause revenue to drop.

18,Attention children of the 90s: you can still get McDonalds pizza,"Remember the crunch of the cornmeal crust? And the stringy cheese, with a slightly sweeter-than normal marinara underneath? Maybe you shoved french fries in it like birthday candles. Or ate it crust first, as was the style at the time. In any case, if youre a child of the nineties, you remember it well: McDonalds pizza. And, like pogs and Beanie Babies, it too disappeared with the innocence of your childhood. Except, in two magical locations in Ohio and West Virginia, where one hero owner has kept the McDonalds pizza ovens burning all these years later. So bust out a gel pen to jot down these directions, because Im about to tell you where you can still buy McDonalds pizza. Neslted on the banks of the Ohio River, along the border with West Virginia sits the village of Pomeroy, population 1,852 in the 2010 census. And its McDonalds, located along Main Street on the riverbank, still pumps out pizza in five minutes or less, of course. Its just a seven-and-a-half hour drive from Toronto in zero traffic, according to Google Maps. And, thanks to owner Greg Mills, theres another McDs where you can still get a slice, just over ninety kilometres away, across the state border. Spencer, West Virginia also boasts a McDonalds thats still lighting the pizza fires or electrical coils, as the case may be. According to employee Judy Norman, its the same pizza as they sold when she started there 11 years ago and its presumably the same that children everywhere enjoyed throughout the 1990s. She said the location sold 13 pizzas yesterday, but there are days when everyone wants pizza and there are days where just every so often you get a pizza [order]. Mills, who its pretty safe to call an American hero for preserving this very unique pizza, couldnt not be immediately reached for comment, but this post will be updated should he return our calls. Whatever actually happened to McDonalds pizza, you ask? Well, for starters, it turned out adult palates didnt quite take to it the same way kids did. When McDonalds first launched its pizza in the Canadian market in the early 90s, it was tapping into a growing appetite for pizza as burger sales dwindled. It even launched hockey-themed TV ads. The market for the savoury pie topped $2 billion in the early 90s, according to a 2004 National Post article on the death of McDonalds pizza. And the company poured $25 million into the ovens alone across Canada, to moderate success throughout the decade. Then the-drive through took over remember waiting for your pizza to be delivered with a plastic number on top of your car? and pizza slowed things down as its own sales were dragging. So the ovens were scrapped and McDonalds turned its sights on other gimmicky productions like the Arch Deluxe, which I think we can blame for Jessica Biel becoming a thing. The saddest clarification of all time: As first reported by Metro Montreal and translated by Emergent, it appears theres some confusion as to whether the pizza being sold at these two locations is the McPizza we all remember. Unfortunately, McDonalds headquarters says its not the exact recipe, but its also reviewed online as being very close. So, the only way to sure is a road trip followed by a taste test.

McDonalds has just announced that it will be phasing out 8 menu items the beginning of next year and most McDonalds customers are not happy. With McDonalds profits tanking over the recent months, the company has had to make some tough decisions to find adequate solutions for their financial distress by shrinking menu sizes. Our intent is to have a cleaner menu board that is easier for customers to absorb, spokeswoman Lisa McComb said in a statement. To do so we must simplify our current menu. This means the end of the Big Mac, apple pie and large size menu items. Currently, the Big Mac has a whopping 550 calories and 29g of fat. The Apple pie contains 250 cal, and it would take a full 69 minute to walk that off! With that being said, those two menu items were not a tough decision for elimination. McDonalds is currently testing out a new version of their slim down menu in Delaware, Little Rock, Waco, Bakersfield, Macon and Knoxville. They plan a full nationwide rollout beginning February 1, 2015. One notable ingredient preservatives might also be eliminated from the menu altogether. Mark Andrs, President of McDonalds USA, sparked widespread speculation when he asked investors, Why do we need to have preservatives in our food? And then answered himself with a We probably dont.

21,Reasons to Love New York 2014,"Editor's Note: In the most recent edition of New York, its annual Reasons to Love New York issue, the magazine published this story about a Stuyvesant High School senior named Mohammed Islam, who was rumored to have made $72 million trading stocks. Islam said his net worth was in the ""high eight figures."" As part of the research process, the magazine sent a fact-checker to Stuyvesant, where Islam produced a document that appeared to be a Chase bank statement attesting to an eight-figure bank account. After the story's publication, people questioned the $72 million figure in the headline, which was written by editors based on the rumored figure. The headline was amended. But in an interview with the New York Observer last night, Islam now says his entire story was made up. A source close to the Islam family told the Washington Post that the statements were falsified. We were duped. Our fact-checking process was obviously inadequate; we take full responsibility and we should have known better. New York apologizes to our readers. Rumors, on Wall Street, can be powerful. A whisper can turn into a current that moves markets, driving a stock price up or sending it tumbling. There may be only one other place where gossip holds such sway, and that is high school. Late last year, a rumor began circulating at Stuyvesant that a junior named Mohammed Islam had made a fortune in the stock market. Not a small fortune, either. Seventy-two million. An unbelievable amount of money for anyone, not least a high-school student, but as far as rumors go, this one seemed legit. Everyone at Stuy knew that Mohammed, the soft-spoken son of Bengali immigrants from Queens and the president of the schools Investment Club, was basically a genius. As the news spread, Mos stock went up. The school paper profiled him, Business Insider included him on a list of 20 Under 20, and Mo became a celebrity, as his friend Damir Tulemaganbetov put it on a recent Friday night at Mari Vanna near Union Square. A VIP! Mo, a cherubic senior with a goatee and slight faux-hawk, smiled shyly. Hes quiet today, said Patrick Trablusi, who was seated with Mo and Damir at a table littered with empty glasses. Humble. And tired: This is our third meeting of the day, Damir said, signaling to the waitress for another round. We saw a real-estate agent, a lawyer, you Next were going to see a hedge-fund guy, Patrick said. The friends locked eyes and started to giggle. He basically wants to give us $150 million, Mo explained, a blush like a sunset creeping over his cheeks. The waitress arrived with a tray of green drinks. Freshly squeezed apple juice, Damir said, passing them around. Its very good. Do you like caviar? After Mo became a celebrity, things got a little awkward at school. (Arent you the kid who made all that money? a teacher asked him.) So he reconnected with kids from his old school, Allen-Stevenson. One of them introduced him to Patrick, an aspiring financier, who introduced him to Damir at a poker game attended by kids whose parents are, according to Damir, the one percent of the one percent. The son of a Kazakh oligarch, Damir is tall, slim, and cocky, like a cigarette wearing a fedora. I call the poker game Destiny,'""he said. The waitress arrived with a plate. Here, have some caviar. Over late nights out and dinners at Morimoto, the three hatched a plan to start a hedge fund. There are a lot of steps we have to follow through, said Patrick, calling to mind a more serious Chuck Bass. But were on the right track. They plan to launch in June, after Mo turns 18 and can get his broker-dealer license. Mos our maestro, Patrick said. Hes going to be earning the big bucks. Were just going to try to fill his needs. All three plan to attend college next year, but theyre not concerned about classes getting in the way of their goal: A billion dollars! Damir said. By next year! Mo affirmed the number with a nod. But its not just about money, he added. We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence, like the Koch brothers Like in Wolf of Wall Street! Damir interjected. And Mo is Jordan Belfort. No, but, not like that, Patrick said, blanching slightly. Like Belfort, Mo started with penny stocks. A cousin showed him how to trade. He loved the feeling of riskthe way his hand shook making the tradebut he swore it off after losing a chunk of the money hed made tutoring. I didnt have the balls for it, he said. He was 9. It was a while before he was ready to try again. In the meantime, he became a scholar of modern finance, studying up on hedge-fund managers. He was particularly enamored of Paul Tudor Jones. I had been paralyzed by my loss, Mo said. But he was able to go back to it, even after losing thousands of dollars over and over. Paul Tudor Jones says, You learn more from your losses than from your gains. Mo got into trading oil and gold, and his bank account grew. Though he is shy about the $72 million number, he confirmed his net worth is in the high eight figures. More than enough to rent an apartment in Manhattanthough his parents wont let him live in it until he turns 18and acquire a BMW, which he cant drive because he doesnt yet have a license. Thus, it falls to his father to drive him past Tudor Joness Greenwich house for inspiration. Its because he is who he is that made me who I am today, Mo said. Which is to say: a believer in Wall Street. A lot of young people do start-ups, but I think its a bubble. Trading and investments will always be there. Money will always be rotating Money never sleeps! Damir added. Thats from the Wall Street movie. It all comes down to this, Mo continued. What makes the world go round? Money. If money is not flowing, if businesses dont keep going, theres no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs. The check arrived for the caviar and apple juice. It totaled $400. New York, thats where the moneys at, Damir shouted, pulling out a credit card. This reminded me of an old joke about robbing banks because thats where the money is. Damir grinned. My father has a quote, he said. Its really dope: You can rob a bank with a gun, but you can rob the whole world with a bank. Patrick buried his face in his hands. At the end of the day, he said, were young kids.",FALSE,http://nymag.com/news/articles/reasonstoloveny/2014/mohammed-islam-stock-trading/,Economy,Emergent
22,Here come the autonomous robot security guards: What could possibly go wrong?,"Showing a rather shocking disregard for the long-term safety of human civilization, Microsoft has become one of the first companies to deploy autonomous robot security guards. Dubbed the K5, Microsofts Silicon Valley campus was being policed last week by five of these roughly human-sized 300-pound (136 kg) robots, each equipped with enough cameras, sensors, artificial intelligence, and alarms that they can replace most human security patrols. Fortunately, despite looking like uncomfortably like a Dalek from the Doctor Who universe, the K5 is not (yet) equipped with a ray gun or any other method for harming or detaining humans. Updated: Microsoft contacted ExtremeTech to tell us that the robots were only temporarily deployed at its Silicon Valley campus, as part of a demonstration put on by Knightscope. Microsoft PR says it isnt aware of any future plans to deploy such robots. The K5, built by the Californian company Knightscope, is billed rather euphemistically as an autonomous data machine that provides a commanding but friendly physical presence. Basically, its a security guard on wheels. Inside that rather large casing (its 5 foot tall!) there are four high-def cameras facing in each direction, another camera that can do car license plate recognition, four microphones, gentle alarms, blaring sirens, weather sensors, and WiFi connectivity so that each robot can contact HQ if theres some kind of security breach/situation. For navigating the environment, theres GPS and laser scanning (LIDAR I guess). And of course, at the heart of each K5 is a computer running artificial intelligence software that integrates all of that data and tries to make intelligent inferences like, should I tell HQ about that large gathering of teenagers, or should that man be climbing in through that window? If a K5 decides that theres a situation, it can use one of its built-in sirens to try and diffuse things or it can message HQ to summon a human. If you step in front of the K5, or otherwise interfere with it, it will gently warn you with some chimes but if you dont move, an ear-piercing alarm is triggered. Other than its sirens and its rather imposing design, the K5 isnt equipped with any weapons or other tools for resolving situations. (Does anyone else think it looks like the lovechild of a Dalek and EVE from WALL-E?) K5 isnt just for catching criminals, either: If you find yourself in trouble/danger, theres also a button on the top of the robot that summons help from HQ. Read: Microsoft wants to be part of Judgment Day, too The purpose of the K5, like most robots, is straightforward: To replace expensive human workers. The K5 can run for around 24 hours on a single battery charge, automatically navigates back to the charging point when its running low, and only takes 15-20 minutes to recharge. Obviously, in the long run, this is cheaper and more efficient than a human security guard plus, as technology improves, the K5 will probably be more vigilant and capable of spotting smaller discrepancies than a human. In theory, because of the lower cost, you could also field lots of K5 robots, reducing the number of potential holes in security coverage. It goes without saying, though, that deploying a fleet of roughly human-sized, autonomous robots is just a little bit scary. At the very least, a 300-pound robot would cause a lot of damage if it ran into something a car, a shop window, a child. In all likelihood, though, if these robotic security guards are popular, theyll eventually be equipped with weapons perhaps a taser for subduing a suspect, and a tear gas launcher for clearing groups of people. At that point, you need to be really sure that the AI is free of bugs.

27,Jeff Bezos's New Plan for News: The Washington Post Becomes an Amazon Product,"SHARE THIS ARTICLE Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Jeff Bezos wants to turn the Washington Post into a national publication, and hes going to use his other companyAmazon.comto help achieve that goal. For the past few months, a group inside the Post has been working on a new application that will offer a curated selection of news and photographs from the daily newspaper in a magazine-style, tablet-friendly format. The application will come preinstalled on Amazons newly updated Kindle Fire tablet, expected to be launched later this fall with the larger 8.9-inch screen, according to people with knowledge of the Posts plans. The app will be free for owners of the larger Kindle, at least at first. It will eventually be available for download on other Kindles as well as to owners of Apples iPad and various Android devices, and it will carry a monthly subscription fee. A Post spokesperson declined to comment. Inside the Post, the effort has been dubbed Project Rainbow and is being led by Kerry Lauerman, the former editor-in-chief of Salon.com. Lauerman joined the paper as a senior editor in July to work on an initiative focused on the fast-growing mobile readership, according to a Post press release announcing the hire. Lauerman reports to Cory Haik, the Posts executive producer for digital news. One person with knowledge of Project Rainbow called it an experiment and part of a larger effort to find ways to expand the Posts reach. Its the first sign that Bezos will create ties between the newspaper and the e-commerce giant he started 20 years ago. Since Bezos bought the paper last year, media observers have wondered how he will resuscitate a franchise with plenty of old-media challenges, such as declining print advertising and a readership that increasingly gets its news online and from mobile devices. The paper introduced a novel program that allows smaller publications to give their paying readers online access to the Posts website. In September, meanwhile, Bezos dismissed the Posts longtime publisher, Katharine Weymouth, and replaced her with Frederick J. Ryan Jr., a former aide to President Ronald Reagan. Bezos has also accelerated hiring at the newspaper, bringing in 100 new journalists while cutting pensions and other retirement benefits for current employees. The resulting buzz has been positive, on balance. David Carr, media columnist at the New York Times, just heralded a recent turnaround in quality: The once-embattled newspaper, he wrote, is in the middle of a great run, turning out the kind of reporting that journalistsand readerslive for. Amazons Kindle Fire tablets and its new Fire Phone lag in popularity behind competing tablets and phones from Apple, Samsung Electronics, and others.

30,Comcast Declares War on Tor?,"If you needed another reason to hate Comcast, the most hated company in America, theyve just given it to you: theyve declared war on Tor Browser. >>Hide Your Tor Usage From your ISP Click here For Our Best VPNs Chart!<<< Reports have surfaced (The first one was via /r/darknetmarkets and another one submitted to us) that Comcast agents have contacted customers using Tor and instructed them to stop using the browser or risk termination of service. A Comcast agent named Jeremy allegedly called Tor an illegal service. The Comcast agent told its customer that such activity is against usage policies. The Comcast agent then repeatedly asked the customer to tell him what sites he was accessing on the Tor browser. The customer refused to answer. The next day the customer called Comcast and spoke to another agent named Kelly who reiterated that Comcast does not want its customers using Tor. The Comcast agent then allegedly told the customer: Users who try to use anonymity, or cover themselves up on the internet, are usually doing things that arent so-to-speak legal. We have the right to terminate, fine, or suspend your account at anytime due to you violating the rules. Do you have any other questions? Thank you for contacting Comcast, have a great day. How did Comcast know its customers were using Tor in the first place? Because Tor Browser provides online anonymity to its users, This would mean that Comcast is monitoring the online activities of its users, to (among other things) check if they are following their Acceptable Use Policy. Comcast has previously been listed by the Tor project as a Bad ISP. The users of the Tor project listed Comcast as a bad ISP that is not friendly to Tor. The Tor project cited Comcasts Acceptable Use Policy for its residential customers which claims to not allow servers or proxies under technical restrictions.: use or run dedicated, stand-alone equipment or servers from the Premises that provide network content or any other services to anyone outside of your Premises local area network (PremisesLAN), also commonly referred to as public services or servers. Examples of prohibited equipment and servers include, but are not limited to, email, web hosting, file sharing, and proxy services and servers; A Comcast spokesperson told DeepDotWeb that: We respect customer privacy and security and would only investigate the specifics of a customers account with a valid court order. And if were asked by a court to provide customer information, then we ask for a reasonable amount of time to notify the customer so they can decide if they would like to hire a lawyer and if they do, then we turn the case over to them and they proceed with the judge directly and we step away. However, this statement appears to be at odds with Comcasts treatment of Ross Ulbricht, alleged Dread Pirate Roberts. Comcast previously corroborated with the FBI by providing information on alleged Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbrichts internet usage. Ulbrichts legal defense without a warrant. Ulbricht was most certainly never given a warning by Comcast or given time to contact a lawyer before he was arrested in a San Francisco library last October. Comcast already monitors its customers internet usage to prevent them from downloading pirated media in violation of copyright laws. Under the Six Strikes plan, Comcast customers who are caught by Comcast pirating copy-written material are emailed by Comcast and told to cease the activity. Comcast will continue monitoring them, and if they violate the Six Strikes plan five more times, their internet service will be terminated. EDIT 14.9.14: Removed a sentence that was wrong. Added link. EDIT2 15.9.14: Comcast released a post Setting the Record Straight on Tor denying the above and stating: The anecdotal chat room evidence described in these reports is not accurate.

34,Apples next major Mac revealed: the radically new 12-inch MacBook Air,"Apple is preparing an all-new MacBook Air for 2015 with a radically new design that jettisons standards such as full-sized USB ports, MagSafe connectors, and SD card slots in favor of a markedly thinner and lighter body with a higher-resolution display. Sources within Apple, who have used internal prototype versions of the upcoming computer, have provided in-depth details about the machine, and our exclusive artist renditions of the revamped MacBook Air provide the first close look at Apples first major step in mobile Mac computing since the Retina MacBook Pro launch in 2012. iPad Air 2 The 12-inch MacBook Air will be considerably smaller than the current 13-inch version, yet also slightly narrower than the 11-inch model. The new 12-inch version is approximately a quarter-of-an-inch narrower than the 11-inch version, yet it is also a quarter-of-an-inch taller in order to accommodate the slightly larger display. In order to fit the larger screen into a footprint about the size of the current 11-inch model, the bezels on the display have been reduced on all sides. Besides a new look for the front of the computer, the entire unibody has been revamped from the keyboard to the trackpad to the speakers. Taking cues from the 12-inch PowerBook introduced by Steve Jobs over a decade ago, the new keyboard sits edge-to-edge across the width of the laptop. In addition to going edge-to-edge, the entire key set has been subtly redesigned so that each key sits noticeably closer together. Apple has squeezed the keys closer in order for the computer to be as narrow as possible, which can be seen in the rendition below: Apple has also relocated some of the function keys across the top and simplified the arrow key array in order to keep the keyboard as narrow as possible without taking away from overall usability. In addition to the keyboard, the trackpad has been changed. The trackpad is approximately the same width as that on the 11-inch MacBook Air (if not ever-so-slightly wider), but it is apparently slightly taller, nearly touching the bottoms of the keyboard and the frame. In line with earlier rumors, it also appears that the new trackpad does not have the same clicking effect as found on current and earlier MacBook models. The elimination of physical feedback in the click is part of Apples plan to reduce the thickness of the MacBook to a bare minimum. As can be seen in 9to5Mac artist Michael Steebers rendition above, the new 12-inch Air (on the left) is far thinner than the current 11-inch model (on the right). Taking cues from the current Air, the future model has a teardrop-like, tapered design that gets thinner from top to bottom. Above the keyboard are four redesigned speaker grills that actually double as ventilation holes for the fan-less device to keep cool. The upcoming laptop is so thin that Apple employees are said to refer to the device as the MacBook Stealth internally. In order to reach that new level of portability, Apple not only slimmed down the trackpad and tweaked the speakers but the ports as well: The upcoming 12-inch Air has the fewest amount of ports ever on an Apple computer, as can be seen in the rendition above. On the right side is a standard headphone jack and dual-microphones for input and noise-canceling. On the left side is solely the new USB Type-C port. Yes, Apple is currently planning to ditch standard USB ports, the SD Card slot, and even its Thunderbolt and MagSafe charging standards on this new notebook. We must note that Apple tests several designs of upcoming products, so Apple may choose to ultimately release a new Air that does include the legacy components, though there is very little space on the edges for them. As weve reported on multiple occasions, the new USB Type-C connector is smaller, faster, and more capable than the standard USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports on existing computers. The connector is able to replace the Thunderbolt Display port on the current Apple laptops as USB Type-C actually has the technology to drive displays. Additionally, the latest specifications from the USB foundation indicate that USB Type-C can actually be used to power computers, which makes the standard MagSafe plugs unnecessary on this new device. The connector is also reversible like Lightning on iPads and iPhones, which should make the overall experience a bit more intuitive. As the new MacBook may only have a single port, it would make sense for Apple to create a hub of some sort for users to be able to plug in multiple devices into the new laptop. Apple already ships all sorts of adapters for its Macs and iOS Devices, so adding yet another attachment to the accessory portfolio would not be unprecedented. With Apple moving to a new Space Gray color on its iOS devices and on some Macs (such as with the 2013 Mac Pro), it seems possible that this new MacBook may come in a new gray color, as shown off in some of our renditions. The latest rumors indicate that the new MacBook Air will ship in mid-2015 (perhaps around WWDC), while other reports have claimed that the new Air is already nearing production. With Intel revealing the latest news on the Broadwell chipset family at CES this week, the ball is likely now in Apples court for pushing the future of mobile computing into the world.",TRUE,http://9to5mac.com/2015/01/06/macbook-air-12-inch-redesign/,Economy,Emergent
0,Amazon reports strong 4Q results despite supply chain snags,"NEW YORK (AP) ��� Amazon is reporting strong fourth-quarter sales and profits even as the online behemoth continues to contend with surging costs tied to a snarled supply chain and labor shortages.

The company, based in Seattle, also raised its annual prime membership fee to $139 per year from $119. This is the first time Amazon has raised the price of Prime membership since 2018.

The company reported a profit of $14.32 billion, or $27.75 per share, for the three-month period ended Dec. 31, 2021. That compared with a profit of $7.22 billion, or $14.09 per share, a share, during the year-ago period. Revenue rose 9% to $137.41 billion, the company���s fifth consecutive quarter of revenue topping $100 billion.

Analysts surveyed by FactSet, however, on average expected $137.68 billion in quarterly revenue and per-share earnings of $3.61 per share.

The company said that sales are expected to be between $112 billion and $117 billion for the current fiscal quarter. Analysts were expecting $120.93 billion, according to FactSet estimates.

Amazon was one of the few retailers that has prospered during the COVID-19 outbreak: As physical stores selling non-essential goods temporarily or permanently closed, homebound people turned to Amazon for everything from groceries to cleaning supplies.

But growth has slowed as newly vaccinated Americans feel comfortable going out. And the company, like many others, are dealing with global supply chain issues and shortages of workers.

0,"Meta, formerly Facebook, faces historic drop as stock tanks","Meta is putting a lot of virtual eggs ��� and billions of dollars ��� into the metaverse basket, and Wall Street is pretty anxious about it.

Shares of the company formerly known as Facebook saw a historic plunge Thursday after the social media giant reported a rare profit decline due to a sharp rise in expenses, shaky ad revenue growth, competition from TikTok and fewer daily U.S. users on its flagship platform.

At the same time, it invested more than $10 billion in CEO Mark Zuckerberg���s ambitious plan to transform Meta Platforms Inc. into a virtual reality ��� actually, make that ���metaverse-based��� ��� company.

Meta���s shares fell more than 26% to $237.76 in afternoon trading Thursday, lopping more than $230 billion off the company���s overall value, or market capitalization. That���s the largest single-day decline for a company on record.

���Meta is sacrificing its core business model for its fascination with the metaverse,��� said Rachel Jones, an analyst with the research firm GlobalData. ���Betting big on the metaverse isn���t a bad thing ��� the technology is set to be huge and provide a multitude of opportunities ��� but it will take at least another decade to really get going.���

Congress takes up controversy over 5G service near airports
While tech companies are accustomed to making big bets on futuristic-sounding ideas that sometimes become reality ��� and come with a huge payoff ��� Wall Street doesn���t like uncertainty. There���s also the inconvenient fact of Facebook���s continued difficulty in dealing with toxic real-world effects on its existing platform.

There���s ���continued concern that Facebook���s past challenges will follow Meta into the metaverse,��� said Mike Proulx, research director at Forrester Research. ���The company has work to do to convince consumers that Meta���s expression of the metaverse is a good thing,���

Since Meta took on its new name last fall, the company has been shifting resources and hiring engineers ��� including from competitors like Apple and Google ��� who can help Zuckerberg realize his vision.

Think of the metaverse as the internet brought to life, or at least rendered in 3D. Zuckerberg has described it as a ���virtual environment��� in which you can immerse yourself instead of just staring at a screen. Theoretically, the metaverse would be a place where people can meet, work and play using virtual reality headsets, augmented reality glasses, smartphone apps or other devices.

It might sound like science fiction, but then again, not long ago so were computers that fit in your pocket, driverless cars and microwaves that talk to you. Technology barrels ahead whether we like it or not and, to quote a vintage Facebook motivational poster in the company���s headquarters, ���fortune favors the bold.��� Despite an enormous backlash to Facebook���s problems ranging from misinformation and privacy mishaps to teen mental health and hate speech, Zuckerberg continues to believe that bold bets to steer the company in new directions have generally paid off.

In a Wednesday conference call, Zuckerberg said the company���s investments this year will focus on Reels ��� a TikTok-esque short form video service on Instagram ��� as well as messaging, ads, commerce, privacy, artificial intelligence ���and, of course, the metaverse.���

���Making meaningful progress across all seven of these areas is going to improve the services we offer today and will help power a social, intuitive, and entertaining metaverse,��� he said. But he acknowledged that ���this fully realized vision is still a ways off, and although the direction is clear, our path ahead is not perfectly defined.���

But while Wall Street���s metaverse optimism appears to fall well short off Zuckerberg���s, Meta���s rivals are ramping up their own metaverse projects. This includes Apple, Google and Microsoft, which recently bought the video game company Activision Blizzard with the hopes of accelerating its ambitions for the metaverse.

But it���s not just the big companies. According to app analytics company SensorTower, 86 apps added ���metaverse��� to their title or description from November 2021 through January of this year. To date, 552 mobile apps include the term ���metaverse��� in their title or description.

Stifel analyst Mark Kelley sought to calm investors, noting that Zuckerberg outlined not one but seven investment priorities for the company this year. He said he doesn���t think Meta���s initial goal of reaching 1 billion metaverse users is a stretch ��� and importantly, he believes only 40% would be gamers, signaling its broader appeal.

Meta���s stock plunge doesn���t discourage metaverse enthusiast and venture capitalist Matthew Ball, who months before Facebook���s renaming started an index fund of metaverse-related companies. Meta the company is one of the 45 stocks in Ball���s index.

���Mark���s focus on the next-generation internet is actually justified by the fact they can see in their core business that growth is slowing, that users are shifting elsewhere, and in particular, young users are shifting to these virtual and immersive worlds where they���re a small participant and where their investments are focused,��� he said.

0,Japanese game maker Nintendo���s profits hurt by chips crunch,"TOKYO (AP) ��� Nintendo���s profit for the nine months through December slipped 2.5%, as shortages of computer chips hurt production, the Japanese video game maker behind the Super Mario and Pokemon franchises said Thursday.

Kyoto-based Nintendo Co. recorded a 367 billion yen ($3.2 billion) profit for the period, down from 377 billion yen the previous year. Its sales in the same period fell 6% to 1.3 trillion yen ($11 billion).

Game makers have reaped windfall profits from more people staying home during the pandemic. But sales of Nintendo Switch consoles had more momentum in the previous fiscal year, driven by its hit ���Animal Crossing: New Horizons.���

Console sales are often driven by hit games, although the devices tend to sell better early on and then slowly decline in popularity.

Nintendo cut its forecast for Switch console sales for the fiscal year through March to 23 million machines. It had forecast 24 million units, previously slashed from an projection of 25.5 million units.

President Shuntaro Furukawa has said the dearth of computer chips has hindered output, complicating planning for the next fiscal year and beyond.

The problem has also slowed the design process for its next game machine. Nintendo is developing a device to follow the Switch.

Despite the setbacks, more than 100 million Switch machines have sold so far globally. Its most popular games for the latest period were ���Pok��mon Brilliant Diamond��� and ���Pok��mon Shining Pearl,��� and new Mario Kart and Mario Party games.

���Pokemon Legends Arceus,��� which went on sale last month, and the latest Kirby game, set for release in March, are expected to boost sales in the final fiscal quarter, according to Nintendo.

Nintendo faces stiff competition both from longtime rivals such as Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp. and from newcomers like Netflix and Google.

Microsoft recently announced it���s acquiring Activision Blizzard, the maker of Candy Crush and Call of Duty, for $68.7 billion, turning the maker of the Xbox into one of the world���s largest game companies.

Sony, which makes the PlayStation series of consoles, is acquiring Bungie Inc., known for its Halo and Destiny games, for $3.6 billion. Such acquisitions add game titles under their wings and in effect dwarf Nintendo.

In the name of fear and political exploitation of anti-gun rhetoric, a citizens Second Amendment rights have been ripped away from him by the government.

2035,Gubernatorial Candidate Travis Allen: Arrest Jerry Brown For Defying Federal Immigration Laws,"This is the fifth installment in a series of Capital Public Radio interviews with the prominent candidates for California governor. You can find all the interviews here. The Trump administration has suggested it may try to prosecute elected officials who help enact or enforce state or local immigration measures that conflict with federal law. Travis Allen thinks the feds should arrest the man he hopes to replace as California governor. The Republican assemblyman from Orange County, one of three GOP candidates to succeed termed-out Gov. Jerry Brown, says the Democrat should face consequences for signing a bill last year that limits state and local law enforcement agencies from cooperating with federal immigration authorities. Absolutely, absolutely, Allen said when asked whether Brown should be arrested in a recent interview with Capital Public Radio. This whole sanctuary state  it's an illegal concept, and it is very clear that immigration is the specific duty of the federal government. Jerry Brown is breaking federal law by instituting this illegal sanctuary state, Allen said. There is a federal immigration law and it must be followed by California. That drew a sharp response from Browns office. Given this individuals day job, one would expect him to be a bit more familiar with the law and how it works, press secretary Evan Westrup wrote in an email. Hopefully hell consider doing a little homework  and thinking  before saying such an absurd thing aloud next time. The measure, Senate Bill 54, easily passed the Legislature last fall after Brown and the bills author, Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Len, negotiated amendments that addressed some concerns among law enforcement groups. Westrup also pointed to a passage in Browns SB 54 signing message: It is important to note what the bill does not do, Brown wrote last fall. This bill does not prevent or prohibit Immigration and Customs Enforcement or the Department of Homeland Security from doing their own work in any way. They are free to use their own considerable resources to enforce federal immigration law in California. After his interview was broadcast and this article was published, the assemblyman reached out to say he realized his answer needed clarification. To be more precise, the Justice Department should arrest Jerry Brown if he takes any action to enforce SB 54 that interferes with Federal Immigration authorities doing their constitutional duty, Allen wrote in an email. A good example is [California Attorney General] Xavier Becerra threatening California employers if they cooperate with [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]. Still, Allen is convinced California voters are on his side of the argument. He says the new law is sheltering people in this state who are here illegally and committing crimes while they are here with taxpayer dollars. If elected governor, hes pledged to reverse the sanctuary state law in his first 100 days in office by calling a special election and placing a ballot initiative before voters. Allen is quick to throw punches at the governor on issues well beyond immigration. He said Brown lied by signing a transportation funding bill last year that included fuel tax and vehicle fee increases after promising no new taxes without voter approval during the 2010 gubernatorial campaign. And, referring to several side deals reached to ensure the gas tax bills passage by funding transportation projects in four lawmakers districts, he said Brown was able to bribe four legislators a billion dollars. Asked to name something the governor has done right, Allen declared Browns governorship a legacy of failures. He pointed to the embattled Delta tunnels and high-speed rail projects. Jerry Brown is a lot of talk, and he always has been a lot of talk, he said. A Tea Party Stalwart, But Not An Immediate Trump Supporter Allen is in his sixth year in the Assembly, representing an Orange County district that includes his hometown of Huntington Beach. Hes run an investment advising business since 2001, but grew frustrated watching clients, family and friends move out of California because of the states high taxes and cost of living. So he decided to run for office. I dont think we should have career politicians in California, he said. I think our politicians should be forced to live in the real world and pay real taxes and live under all those crazy laws that they are putting out there. Since his election in 2012, Allen has carved out a voting record and speaking style of an unabashed conservative, the Tea Party, and, he says, President Donald Trump. But he was not an immediate Trump supporter in the 2016 presidential campaign. He first backed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (I thought he had a great chance against Hillary Clinton), then Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (I like the fact that Ted was not afraid to take on the entire establishment). But Allen rallied behind Trump as soon as he became the presumptive GOP nominee, writing an op-ed in May 2016 headlined Its time for Republicans to unify behind Trump. For anyone who believes in common sense and economic prosperity and the Republican values, Allen said in our interview, it was very clear there was only one choice: You're either going to vote for Donald Trump, or anything else you do will support Hillary Clinton. In contrast, Allen noted, one of his rival GOP gubernatorial candidates, San Diego businessman John Cox, voted for libertarian Gary Johnson. I'm the only person in the governor's race, up until just lately, that actually openly supported the president, Allen said. (Cox recently told Capital Public Radio that his vote was a mistake, and that he now backs President Trump.) The other Republican in the governors race, former Sacramento-area Rep. Doug Ose, endorsed Trump even earlier than Allen did and played a leading role in the presidents California campaign. Allen has nothing but praise for Trumps record as president, and vows to bring the same leadership style to California. We need somebody that is not afraid of taking on the establishment on either side, to actually implement policies that are for the best of our state, he said. And I have to tell ya, this is exactly what I think our president's done for our country. Allen voiced support for the federal tax overhaul that Trump and congressional Republicans passed late last year. The new law caps the state and local income and property tax deduction at $10,000, which is expected to increase federal taxes owed by wealthy Californians. In extra-high tax states like California, taking away that state and local deduction against federal taxes  it's gonna hurt some people, and that's very true, Allen said. But on balance, the benefit of the federal tax reform is going to be massive for all the states, including California. He rejected a bill by De Len to deduct state income taxes as charitable contributions. The real answer is not some fancy trick proposed by the Sacramento Democrats, Allen said, calling instead for lowering state income tax rates. When you lower taxes across the board in California, you will unleash an economic engine the likes of which the state has not seen since the Gold Rush. Allens first challenge is to finish in the top two, out of the seven current gubernatorial candidates, in the June primary to advance to the November general election. Three reputable polls released in recent months show him ranging from third place to fifth, no closer than six points to second place. To catch up, hell need to rely on his conservative base to turn out voters; his latest fundraising report filed Wednesday shows his campaign is under water: Allen raised nearly $450,000 last year but ended 2017 with $135,535 cash on hand and $342,850 in debt. Thats well behind Cox, who has contributed several million dollars of his own money. (Ose has just started raising money in the last couple of weeks.) Its possible two Democrats will advance to the runoff. But Allen believes he will make it, along with former San Francisco mayor and current Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, whos led in polls throughout the campaign. If so, Allen is convinced hell have a good shot at winning it all. I think the labels are gonna be very clear, he said. Gavin Newsom is the Bay Area progressive that's to the left of [Vermont Sen.] Bernie Sanders, and Travis Allen is the common-sense Californian that just wants California to once again be the greatest state in the nation. Editor's Note: This article has been updated to add a clarification from Asm. Allen about the circumstances under which he thinks Gov. Brown should be arrested for violating federal immigration law.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2018/feb/07/travis-allen/travis-allen-repeats-false-claim-californians-over/,Politics,Polifact
3015,Cox Pins Gubernatorial Campaign On Neighborhood Legislature Initiative,"San Diego businessman and Republican gubernatorial candidate John Cox at the California GOP Convention in Anaheim, Calif., on Saturday, Oct. 21, 2017. This is the third installment in a series of Capital Public Radio interviews with the prominent candidates for California governor. You can find all the interviews here. John Cox says the only way to get money out of California politics is to multiply the number of state lawmakers by 100. Hes dead serious. So serious, in fact, that the San Diego businessman has just spent $2.5 million of his own money to gather more than 800,000 voter signatures to qualify his Neighborhood Legislature initiative for the November 2018 ballot  a ballot he hopes to be on too, as a candidate for California governor. Cox turned his initiative signatures in to county elections officials last week, triggering the signature verification process that will determine whether his measure will go before voters next fall. As long as the districts and the campaigns are driven by media and television and radio, theyre gonna be expensive. And the people who are elected are going to have to dance to the tune of the people who give the money, Cox told Capital Public Radio in an interview at the California Republican Party convention in Anaheim last month. So the only solution that I think Ive found that would really open up the process and get rid of the power of money is to make the money unnecessary, he says, and thats this idea of a Neighborhood Legislature. Under Coxs ballot proposal, the current 40 Senate and 80 Assembly districts would be split up into micro-districts of 10,000 and 5,000 constituents respectively. Currently, each senator represents more than 930,000 constituents and every assembly member more than 465,000. Youre not gonna need to raise money, Cox says. Youre gonna basically almost know everybody in your district. And that way, the funders lose power. Because Californias current population is approximately 39 million, the initiative would initially create roughly 3,900 neighborhood senators and 7,800 neighborhood assembly members. But only 120 of those neighborhood representatives would head to the state Capitol. According to an analysis of the initiative from Californias nonpartisan Legislative Analysts Office: Beginning in 2022 and by a majority vote the (1) elected Senators in a Senate district would select one representative to serve on the Senate Working Committee and (2) elected Assembly Members in an Assembly district would select one representative to serve on the Assembly Working Committee. Ninety-nine percent of those people stay home, Cox says. And the 12,000 people that are in the neighborhoods go about their life and keep tabs on the people in Sacramento. The 40 senators and 120 assembly members who make up the working committees would write, amend and approve bills. But other than urgency measures, no bill could advance to the governors desk without the approval of the full Neighborhood Senate and Neighborhood Assembly. Cox hopes his Neighborhood Legislature initiative will be a springboard for his gubernatorial campaign. Although he isnt well-known, hes the top Republican in recent polls  which also suggest he has a shot at finishing in the top two in Californias open primary system and advancing to the November election. He describes himself as a conservative fed up with Californias shift to the left. Were a laughingstock, he says of the states business climate. And Im just disgusted with the political class in Sacramento that keeps making life more expensive. This is not a functioning state at the present time, he adds. Were careening towards a disaster. And I dont want to see that happen. Cox acknowledges he voted for libertarian Gary Johnson in the 2016 presidential race  but after observing Donald Trumps opening months, I will say, today, sitting here today, that it was a mistake. So far, President Trump has come through on reducing regulation, reducing the size of government, he says. I am very, very supportive of the things hes done. And he plays up his record as a businessman on the campaign trail. Its the politicians that have messed things up at the state Capitol, he says. And Im running against five politicians.""",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2017/nov/16/john-cox/does-california-have-highest-electricity-bills-nat/,Politics,Polifact
3116,Eastin: Jerry Brown Has Really Hurt California Schools,"This is the second installment in a series of Capital Public Radio interviews with the prominent candidates for California governor. You can find all the interviews here. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Delaine Eastin is accusing termed-out Gov. Jerry Brown of tepid and timid leadership  especially on schools. He has really hurt education in this state, she told Capital Public Radio in an interview earlier this month. He hasnt been for universal preschool. He hasnt been for mandatory kindergarten. He hasnt been for reducing the cost to go to college and university. And so Jerrys marks are not high in my book when it comes to education. Eastin, a former Assemblywoman and State Superintendent of Public Instruction, is one of four prominent Democrats running to replace Brown next year. And while she praises some parts of the governors record  such as his fiscal policy and the deal he reached to extend Californias cap-and-trade greenhouse gas emissions reduction program  her assessment of Browns education policies echoes her broader critique of the states direction overall. Californias still the biggest state in the union  the sixth largest economy in the world  and yet, were doing tepid, timid, small things instead of really dreaming big dreams and doing the right things by kids, adults and seniors, she says. Eastin isnt the best-known Democrat running for governor. She hasnt held elected office in nearly 15 years, and she polls at the bottom of the pack. But shes hoping her campaign will catch fire with her laser-like focus on education. She supports universal preschool, mandatory kindergarten and  with California ranking by one measurement 41st of the 50 states in per-pupil spending  a much larger investment in public education. Asked how to pay for her proposals, Eastin says its time to consider changing how property taxes are assessed on commercial properties under Proposition 13. Right now, were wringing our hands, and telling school districts, well, were giving you more money but were also running up the price of the pensions, she says. So lets find a solution here where we do in fact increase the per-pupil spending so that we can increase the education of our children. Browns office responded to Eastins comments by pointing to his education actions as governor: Convincing voters to pass a November 2012 tax initiative to avoid massive cuts to education as California recovered from the Great Recession Record-high state budget funding for schools and community colleges And a new school funding formula intended to send more money to districts with the most low-income students, English language learners and foster youths. Brown has agreed to modest increases in state spending on early childhood education programs in recent years, as the state budget has stabilized. But he has opposed efforts both inside and outside the budget process to create universal preschool, citing a need to keep Californias finances in balance. Eastin even threw a personal shot at Brown, whom she quoted as saying he wasnt hurt by getting kicked out of preschool. (Eastins campaign was not able to provide any sourcing for Browns purported quote, and the governors office said it was not familiar with the governors disciplinary record in preschool.) There are two possible answers, she says. One, yes it did, Governor; and two, you are the very demographic who has the least need for preschool because Browns parents were both educated and affluent. They spoke to you and they read to you and they sang to you and they were wonderful people, Eastin went on, adding that she has the greatest respect for Jerry Browns father Pat, who served as governor from 1959 to 1967. But when it comes to education, I would argue, the last great governor of California was Pat Brown  but its not Jerry.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2017/nov/09/delaine-eastin/false-claim-california-has-built-nearly-four-times/,Politics,Polifact
3236,"Repeal Californias gas tax increase, says GOP candidate","Recently, a group of special interests threatened those daring to propose repeal of the California Democrats $5.2 billion-a-year gas-and-car tax increases. Members of the California Republican congressional delegation and taxpayer protection advocates, including the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, the National Tax Limitation Committee and taxfighter Carl DeMaio, are refusing to back down. They have pledged to take the gas tax repeal to the ballot. I, for one, commend their courage in taking on crony capitalism and the corruption that it breeds. For too long, we have permitted the Democrats to masquerade as the defenders of the poor. They are anything but. This enormous tax at the gas pump, along with the special-interest-driven cap-and-trade tax and huge increase in the vehicle license fee, together constitute an enormous, regressive tax increase. These taxes hit the working poor particularly hard, forcing families to choose between gas in the tank to get to work, or rent, or food on the table. The California Democratic leadership has been at war not only with working families but with small businesses, as well. Through overregulation and the worlds second-highest capital gains tax, California politicians have killed tens of thousands of good-paying jobs, and driven employers out of state. But worst of all, their socialist policies have created the worst poverty rate in the nation, penalizing the very people they pretend to protect. The money robbed from California families will be wasted by the California Department of Transportation, one of the worst-run bureaucracies in the country. In awarding Caltrans its 2016 Golden Fleece Award, the Independent Institute called Caltrans irresponsible for wasting billions of taxpayer dollars and said it even lied to lawmakers to cover its tracks. California spends 4.7 times the national average for every mile of roadway we build and maintain, according to the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Texas, for example, has far better roads on which it spends about $1 for every $5.80 spent by California taxpayers. In Arizona, 80 percent of that work goes out to competitive bidding, but in California, the figure is only 10 percent. Is it any wonder when a government monopoly does the job, it costs more and takes longer? We also routinely discriminate against small business and nonunion workers, which explains why unions and big business joined together to finance an extensive radio-and-newspaper campaign to promote the gas and car tax increase. The corrupting influence of the special interests is hurting all of us, including taxpayers and especially the working poor. It has made California unaffordable for most working families and given us one of the worst small-business climates in the country. By putting crony capitalism on notice, our Republican congressional delegation is showing what real leadership is all about, and in so doing, laying the groundwork for the resurgence of a Republican Party that takes its principles seriously.

3251,New Leadership PAC,"Conservative Texas Leaders Announce New Leadership PAC NLP will participate in 2018 Texas Primaries to recruit and support new House leaders FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Austin, TX (Oct. 18, 2017)Conservative leaders in Texas today announced formation of the New Leadership PAC (NLP), a response to failures of the states 85th Legislative Session and the subsequent special session that was called by Governor Greg Abbott. Governor Abbott called the special session to address 20 conservative policy initiatives, including property tax reform, limits on state and local spending, and ending forced collection of union dues by local governments, most of which failed to pass the House during the regular session. During the month-long special session, the Texas Senate passed bills on all 20 of the Governors initiatives, while the Texas House only passed 11. The House failed to get many important bills out of committees and to the floor for a vote, indicating a lack of will among Republican leadership in the House to advance conservative priorities. Governor Abbotts top political strategist, Dave Carney, said, its pretty clear the culture of the House is corrupt, that its a non-transparent system, that doesnt allow [its members] to have an up or down vote. It has become clear that leaders in the Texas House have lost contact with the core principles of the majority of Texans. Texans deserve better. It is time for a new force for change that will remove these barriers to progress, said Don Dyer, NLPs spokesman and PAC treasurer. NLP is the culmination of discussions among a growing movement of organizations, leaders, and voters across the state. Evidence of the need for NLP is illustrated by the passage of resolutions demanding changes in House leadership by 54 (and growing) of Republican party county chapters that together represent over 50 percent of Texas Republican voters. Our growing list of contributors have been encouraged by the outpouring of support for NLP, and we are committed to find, promote and support a new crop of leaders in the House to ensure common-sense policies for all Texans, said Dyer.

3512,"400,000 Texas children at risk of losing health insurance","Texas has enough funds to run its CHIP program until January or February. About 400,000 Texas children and pregnant women could lose health insurance coverage if the federal government doesnt renew funding for the Childrens Health Insurance Program. Congress missed the Sept. 30 deadline to reauthorize funding for the program, commonly known as CHIP, leaving some states with enough money for the program to last through the end of the year. Texas CHIP would run out of money in January or February. After that, the state could face a $3 billion funding hole over the next two years for the program if Congress does nothing, said Carrie Williams, spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. Weve been watching the CHIP reauthorization issue very closely. Indications are that it will be reauthorized, and we are hopeful for that, Williams said. The House and Senate are working on legislation to continue funding the program. Committees in both chambers are expected to consider the bills Wednesday. Like with any block grant program, Congress must reauthorize funding for CHIP  which covers 9 million children nationally  every few years, but it missed the most recent deadline after failed efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, according to advocacy groups. READ: Travis County DA asked to investigate anti-abortion group Most of the air has been taken out of the room by the Affordable Care Act repeal and replace effort, so I think that got pushed down the agenda, said Stacy Wilson, president of the Childrens Hospital Association of Texas. We are hoping that the bipartisan support that has traditionally underpinned CHIP will continue and that something will get passed. Established in 1997, CHIP covers children in families that have incomes above the threshold to be eligible for Medicaid but cannot afford private insurance or obtain employee coverage. In Texas, a family of four with a monthly income of $4,043 or less, or yearly income of $48,513 or less, can qualify for CHIP. The portion of uninsured Texas children at that income level has dropped from 18 percent in 1998 to 6 percent in 2015, according to the commission. CHIP covers primary health care, prescriptions, mental health, vision, physical and occupational therapies and dental care for children under 19. Additionally, about Texas 36,000 women receive CHIP coverage for prenatal and postpartum services. These are families that are working and their kids are in school, said Celia Neavel, a physician and director of the Center for Adolescent Health at Peoples Community Clinic in Austin. The cost benefit is huge. If they have chronic illnesses and you want to keep them out of the ER, you want to reduce absenteeism in school, having that ability for the kids to get comprehensive well visits, get routine follow-up, get medication, see specialists as needed, that just makes so much sense. Peoples clinic sees multiple CHIP patients a day, particularly pregnant women. LIKE US ON FACEBOOK: Our Lone Star Politics page brings Capitol news to your Facebook feed Austin resident Karen Carbajal, 29, said CHIP is a lifeline for her 1-year-old daughter and 10-year-old son, who was getting a physical at Peoples on Tuesday. We dont qualify for Medicaid. We both make too much money. I work for a car wash and (my husband) works at an automotive junk yard. CHIP is very important for our kids, she said. The bills that Congress is considering would extend the program for another five years but would phase out a 23 percent bump in the federal matching rate over the next few years. That could mean an $800 million loss for Texas in the 2020-21 biennium and possible loss of services. Currently, the federal government pays for most of the cost of the program. The money is significant in just getting that authorized, but you also have to look at how are you paying for it, and if you are paying for it from other vulnerable programs and important health programs, then concern comes up, said Anne Dunkelberg, associate director for the Center for Public Policy Priorities, an Austin-based liberal think tank. Diminishing the federal matching rate could affect another 249,000 children in the Texas Medicaid program. Federal Medicaid funding for those children is tied to the higher CHIP rate. One in 10 babies born in this country is born in Texas, and so it affects us disproportionately if access to health care is compromised for children, said Joyce Mauk, a Fort Worth physician and president of the Texas Pediatric Society. There is nothing good you can say about taking away access to health care for children.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2017/oct/12/joyce-mauk/fort-worth-pediatrician-says-1-10-us-born-babies-b/,Politics,Polifact
4348,What is the Average Cost to House Inmates in Prison,"The average cost of incarceration in the United States is determined by different methods. It costs anywhere between $20,000 and $40,000 per year to house inmates in federal and state correctional facilities; the considerable spread is due to the criteria used by government agencies and prison system watchdogs. There is consensus, however, on the high cost and burden to taxpayers produced by the U.S. penal system. Calculating Costs Per Inmate According to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, the average annual cost of incarceration in Federal prisons in 2010 was $28,284 per inmate. That cost is reduced at the Federal Community Corrections Centers; in 2010 the annual cost was $25,838. According to the California LegislativeAnalyst Office, the annual cost of incarceration in the Golden State in 2009 was $47,102 per year. To arrive at this figure, California analysts took into account the cost of security, health care, operations, administration, support, and rehabilitation programs. Annual costs per inmate in California have almost doubled since the beginning of the 21st century. Watchdog groups that keep an eye on the American judicial and penal systems often arrive at higher figures than those of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons or state agencies. The reason for this discrepancy is that watchdog groups tend to factor in court costs and other expenditures. The cost of incarceration climbs according to the level of security. The Supermaxfederal prison in Colorado spends about $60,000 per year to keep inmates in permanent isolation. The most expensive American prison is located in Cuba: Housing an inmate in Guantanamo Bay costs taxpayers approximately $900,000 per year. According to the Vera Institute of Justice, the average cost of housing an inmate in the U.S. was $31,286 in 2012. New York had the highest cost at $31,286 and Kentucky the lowest at $14,603. The Prison-Industrial Complex Since the U.S. already has the highest incarceration rate in the world, critics of the American criminal justice system warn that the rising prison costs prove the prison-industrial complex theory. The funds allocated to corrections departments across the U.S. take up a significant portion of state budgets. One of the most significant challenges that the prison-industrial complex poses to Americans is its systemic nature. The penal system is intrinsically tied to law enforcement and criminal justice; a sudden, sharp reduction in crime and incarceration rates could affect the economy created by the prison-industrial complex.

5457,112-Year-Old Voters in North Carolina?,"Early voting began in North Carolina in October, and soon after almost 900 voters aged 112 reportedly cast ballots. In fact in 2008, almost 10,000 108-year olds cast ballots and just over 9,000 110-year olds voted in 2010.

The true explanation is much less exciting. Prior to passage of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) in 1993, the state did not require those registering to provide their birth date. While most voters who registered before NVRA did provide birth dates, some did not. These voters were automatically assigned a default birth date of 01/01/1900 in the states voter rolls. So while these voters are still diligently voting, it is very doubtful they are 112 years old.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2017/may/18/chain-email/no-thousands-dead-people-are-not-registered-vote-n/,Politics,Polifact
6003,Public school advocates say no voucher bills have passed in Texas Legislature,"""Texas legislators have filed voucher proposals in every legislative session since 1995, but all of them have failed to become law."" Near the start of this years legislative session, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick stood on the Capitols steps and exhorted lawmakers in the House and Senate to vote on ""school choice"" legislation, saying its ""it's easy to kill a bill when no one gets to vote on it."" An advocacy group opposed to public funds supporting students going to private and religious schools urged a different course. In a Jan. 23, 2017, press release, the Coalition for Public Schools, which says it represents religious, child advocacy and education organizations, urged the Legislature to ""focus its efforts on providing support for our neighborhood public schools instead of funneling public tax dollars"" to private school ""voucher schemes with little or no accountability for how our tax dollars are spent."" The eight-paragraph release closed with a historical claim: ""Texas legislators have filed voucher proposals in every legislative session since 1995, but all of them have failed to become law."" Thatd be a big 0-for-10 for voucher proponents because state lawmakers convene in regular session every odd-numbered year. We decided to check the record. For starters, we knew that Texans in 2017 cant access government-backed vouchers to attend nonpublic schools. Nationally as of December 2016, 27 states afforded some kind of private school choice--and 14 states had voucher plans in law, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a bipartisan group that offers ""support, ideas, connections and a strong voice on Capitol Hill"" for legislators. Wondering how the coalition reached its claim, we contacted a coalition member, the Texas Freedom Network, which says it watchdogs far-right issues, organizations, money and leaders. The networks Jose Medina, whod distributed the coalitions release, emailed us a web link to a 2007 network report including an appendix listing Texas ""voucher legislation"" dating to 1993. Medina also pointed us to the networks ""legislative watch"" web page showing bills filed under topics including vouchers from 1999 through 2015. Defining vouchers We paused to cover some definitions. Huriya Jabbar, a University of Texas education administration professor who has studied school choice and the political dimensions of education reforms, told us that ""school choice"" can include access to charter schools or the option to transfer to a different public school. Meanwhile, ""private school choice"" involves the use of public funds for private or parochial education. Asked about defining school vouchers alone, Jabbar pointed us to a 2015 article in Education Week, which covers schooling from kindergarten through high school. The article, ""What's the Difference Between Vouchers and Education Savings Accounts?,"" explains differences in private school options that often get described collectively as vouchers, a ""politically loaded term,"" the author wrote. The article says vouchers give parents ""public funding allocated for their child toward tuition at a private school of their choice, including religiously affiliated private schools."" Education savings accounts, similar to vouchers, can also pay for private tuition, the story says, though money in an account could be put toward out-of-class educational expenses such as tutoring or online enrichment. States that support such accounts set aside funds based on per-pupil funding estimates; parents may withdraw money for approved expenses, the story says. In Texas in 2017, state Sen. Larry Taylor, R-Friendswood, filed Senate Bill 3 proposing education savings accounts for students from all income levels plus scholarships for students with the ""greatest financial and academic need,"" Taylors measure states, to be supported by tax credits. Thats a funding approach taken by 17 states as of December 2016, according to the NCSL. States employ the credits, the article says, to ""incentivize businesses or individuals to donate money to a scholarship-granting organization, which then gives money to students"" to use for tuition at a private school. Texas is one of the states with constitutional amendments (often referred to as Blaine Amendments) that prohibit state funds from going to religious organizations. In those states, the Education Week article says, tax credit scholarships and education savings accounts ""offer workarounds."" We asked Josh Cunningham, an NCSL education policy specialist, if education savings accounts and tax credit scholarships would reasonably be grouped with vouchers in that each approach furthers public funding of non-public schooling. Cunningham suggested they could, as ""they all for the most part serve a similar purpose, providing support for a public school student to enter into private school."" Dozens of proposals Next, lets review what we spotted in legislation considered since the 1995 session, which we based on text searches of ""voucher,"" ""scholarship"" and ""education savings account,"" to cover bills that dealt with public funding for private school tuition. We ran the terms through both the Texas Legislative Service website Telicon and the Texas Legislature online, which is managed by the Texas Legislative Council, session by session, coming up with 29 proposed bills related to school choice with funding in the form of vouchers, scholarships or savings accounts. We then checked each of the bills listed in the Coalition for Public Schools list in both services, to account for any that our search may have missed. In total, we found 54 relevant bills from every session that covered private ""school choice"" options. Among the proposals over the years, 11 envisioned pilot programs limited to certain student populations. For instance, House Bill 2366, which didnt advance out of a House committee in 1999, called for a pilot program for ""educationally disadvantaged"" students. Six years later, HB 3042, which died in committee, more broadly called for vouchers for all students eligible to attend public schools.

A form of public school choice, short of private-school vouchers, passed into law in 1995 when lawmakers created the Public Education Grant program open to students in any school where half the students or more didnt perform satisfactorily on state tests the three previous years or the school was declared ""low performing"" by the state during those years, according to a 1997 House Research Organization summary. Under the law, each eligible student could attend a school in another district backed by the state and local funding provided for their education in their original district. In 1997, lawmakers widened such opportunities via HB 318 authorizing the state to fund up to 100 ""open-enrollment charter schools,"" which students could attend with the grants, and otherwise allowing eligible students to apply a grant to attend another school in their home districts. Among other tweaks, a student would newly be eligible if half or more of a schools students performed unsatisfactorily in any two of three previous years. A sampling of voucher proposals that died Also in 1997, Rep. Ron Wilson, D-Houston, proposed an amendment to a proposal that wouldve allowed students from low-performing schools to transfer to a private school and have tuition covered by state funds, provided the student attempted to enroll in another public school and was rejected. But House members deadlocked 68-68 on the amendment, which Wilson then withdrew after ""voucher opponents rounded up some absent members who could have killed his measure,"" according to a May 8, 1997 Houston Chronicle news article. At the time, state Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, called that moment the Houses ""closest vote ever"" on vouchers. Among other measures that would put public funds toward private school costs that didnt become law was HB 2465, offered in 2003 by Rep. Kent Grusendorf, R-Arlington and chairman of the House Public Education Committee. Grusendorfs plan would have created the Education Freedom Program for students in the states heaviest-enrollment districts. The bills analysis states that under the proposal, if a district served more than 40,000 students and a majority qualified as ""educationally disadvantaged,"" those students whose families met certain financial requirements could attend private schools with state aid. The bill won the endorsement of the House Public Education panel by 5-3, but didnt make it to the House floor before the session ended. According to minutes of the House Calendars Committee, that panel voted 7-0 on May 10, 2003, not to move the legislation to the House ""at this time."" Before the education committee acted, according to an April 4, 2003 news story in the Dallas Morning News, HB 2465 was fiercely debated with teacher groups and local school boards arguing against approval, saying the legislation would ""rob the public schools of millions of dollars at a time when many are cutting programs."" Proponents, such as Chris Patterson with the Texas Public Policy Foundation, said that some children are still left behind in Texas, despite improvements to public education over the past two decades. A dozen years later, in the 2015 legislative session, Senate Bill 4, authored by Sens. Taylor; Paul Bettencourt, R-Houston; and Donna Campbell R-New Braunfels, would have given a low-income student or a student with disabilities a tax-credit scholarship to ""attend the school of their choice,"" public or private. A bill analysis by the Senate Research Center added that the bill would have allowed businesses to make donations to an ""educational scholarship organization"" and thus receive a tax credit for the donation. According to an April 2015 news story in the Austin American-Statesman, the 31-member Senate gave preliminary approval to the bill on a ""mixed 18-12 vote after rejecting a handful of Democratic-proposed amendments to the measure."" A Democrat, Sen. Eddie Lucio, Jr. of Brownsville, voted for the proposal, the story said, with Republican Sens. Robert Nichols of Jacksonville and Konni Burton of Colleyville voting against it. In the House, where the measure died May 5, 2015 after it was referred to the Ways and Means committee, Republicans such as House Public Education Chairman Rep. Jimmie Don Aycock of Killeen expressed concern with the states abilities to hold private schools accountable to the same standards as public schools. We reached out to organizations supportive of educational savings accounts to see how this claim stacked up in their eyes -- the Texas Public Policy Foundation and Texans for Education Opportunity. The foundations Caroline Espinosa, declined to comment. We didnt hear back from Texans for Education Opportunity. Our ruling The coalition said: ""Texas legislators have filed voucher proposals in every legislative session since 1995, but all of them have failed to become law."" All told, we identified 54 failed bills, at least one in each of the 11 regular sessions from 1995 through 2015, that proposed the use of public funds for private school tuition, though not every one was a pure voucher proposal.

6122,Opinion | Floridas Vengeful Governor,"Although Ms. Ayalas critics have denounced her actions as dereliction of duty, they cannot point to a single law or statute that she has violated. Thats because she hasnt. There are no federal or state laws that say prosecutors must seek death sentences. And the United States Supreme Court has banned all state laws that make executions mandatory for murders. The governors executive order also undercuts the will of the people who last fall elected Ms. Ayala to serve them. Moreover, a poll last year found that nearly two-thirds of Floridians prefer life imprisonment over the imposition of the death penalty. So do people who live in Central Florida, where her district is, 58 percent to 36 percent. As a black man, I see the death penalty as a powerful symbol of injustice in which race often determines who lives and who dies, especially in Florida. The state has the second-largest number of death row inmates in the country, after California, and African-Americans are grossly overrepresented on Floridas death row. This disproportionality was a driving force behind my bill. And while I felt that Florida was not ready to relinquish the death penalty, I tried to make it more fair. Ms. Ayalas arguments for rejecting the death penalty were compelling and well reasoned; they were drawn from the stark racial disparities in the criminal justice system that she confronts every day. Yet Ms. Ayala has always said that she would hold the guilty accountable, including, if he is convicted, the defendant in the first case from which she was removed, Markeith Loyd. Understandably, the issue of how to punish people who kill police officers remains highly charged, especially among law enforcement officials. Many believe that the only proper resolution for the death of Lt. Debra Clayton, the Orlando police officer Mr. Loyd is accused of killing, is an eye for an eye. I get that. But for others, including Stephanie Dixon-Daniels, the mother of Mr. Loyds slain ex-girlfriend, who has also experienced a devastating loss, Ms. Ayalas sentencing choice made sense. The death penalty will continue to drag us back in court and relive this violent, hideous act, Ms. Dixon-Daniels said. Instead, she wants closure.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2017/apr/06/randolph-bracy/has-us-supreme-court-banned-all-state-laws-make-ex/,Politics,Polifact

7875,"Buckingham, Leeder vie for open Hill Country state Senate seat","The race to replace retiring 20-year state Sen. Troy Fraser, R-Horseshoe Bay, will pit Republican Dawn Buckingham against Democrat Virginia Jennie Lou Leeder to represent a district that has traditionally been a GOP stronghold. Early voting for the Nov. 8 election begins Oct. 24. Leeder, chairwoman of Llano Countys Democratic Party from 2007-15, is the first Democrat since 1996 to seek election to Senate District 24, which encompasses 17 counties that stretch from the Hill Country to Abilene, including a slice of western Travis County. A seventh-generation Texan and a Llano resident, Leeder emphasizes her rural roots with a focus on better funding for education, particularly for higher teacher salaries, as well as improving hospital access and the roads and bridges in the district. Im from rural Texas, and I feel like I can relate to the voters. I think its important to understand their pain and what they are going through, she said. They want a senator who understands life in rural Texas. NEWS STRAIGHT TO YOUR INBOX: Click here to get our Morning Headlines email Buckingham, a Lakeway eye surgeon who served on the Lake Travis school board for a year before resigning to run for the Senate, describes herself as a Christian, liberty-minded candidate prepared for tough choices when the Legislature crafts a two-year budget with the states oil and gas industry hurting. I think in a tight budget year, youre going to have to look for opportunities to cut taxes, spending and unnecessary regulations, Buckingham said. We talk about decreasing the footprint of government. It needs to be smaller and less intrusive into our daily lives  and it will cost us less. She supports beefing up security along the border with Mexico and wants to fight sanctuary city policies that discourage police and jail personnel from enforcing immigration laws. Border security, both for our economic viability and the safety of our communities, truly is our No. 1 issue, said Buckingham, 48. The Republican also favors reducing the power of state bureaucrats and unions in local schools and said she would vote for school choice, which would let students attend private schools with public education money. All of our kids need to have the opportunity to go to a good school, not just the wealthy kids, Buckingham said. Leeder, who taught agriculture and physical education for 11 years and is now a swim coach, wants to improve education by overhauling the school finance system to ensure that the state better meets its financial obligations to students. Llano, like many other school districts, is having trouble making ends meet under the current Robin Hood system that siphons money from property-rich districts for distribution to property-poorer ones, she said. We spend more per day to house an inmate than we do on a student, said Leeder, 50. Leeder wants to champion policies that would bring more hospitals and trauma treatment centers to the district. There are places in the 17 counties where people are driving over 50 miles to get good health care, and that is just not acceptable, she said. The Democrat also is concerned by dangerous roads  some without a shoulder, others with unrepaired potholes  in the district, and she wants to put bridges on a tighter inspection schedule. Leeder, however, is far behind in fundraising. In a campaign finance report filed 30 days before the election, the Democrat had $9,377 in the bank after raising $11,620 over the previous three months. Buckingham, in contrast, had $154,037 on hand after raising $195,484 in the same period.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2016/nov/18/jennie-lou-leeder/democrat-jennie-lou-leeder-says-texas-spends-more-/,Politics,Polifact

Im out here today because we as Americans have taken God out of America, said Brown, of Liberty, who said he began his Flagging 40 initiative on Alamance County Interstate 40/85 overpasses in February. I believe that a Trump America would be great for America. As he did Tuesday afternoon, each of those times since February, Brown has flown both a Christian and an American flag. On Tuesday, he was joined by other conservative demonstrators holding Trump and Gadsden Dont Tread On Me flags, along with more Christian and American flags. Browns estimate of how many times he has waved flags over I-40/85 since February was 15 to 30. He said the initiative has grown organically, as other local conservatives learned about and saw what he was doing and decided to join him, each time showing up with their own flags. Nievelis Bittman, there representing the Alamance County Republican Party, was among those who wanted to join Brown in supporting the cause. Were fighting for freedom, said Bittman, a Cuban immigrant to the United States wearing a pin on her chest that read GOP: Gods Official Party. I came from Cuba looking for freedom. Shes a woman for Trump, Brown said of Bittman as the two stood on the overpass holding flags. Oh, definitely, Bittman said. I was there yesterday in Raleigh. Brown said reactions to the demonstrators had been mixed, though as the group continued Tuesday, vehicles were continually honking at them both from the interstate below and the road where they stood. Ive got people that are waving, people that are giving us thumbs up, Brown said. Ive had people give us one finger gestures. Whether they cant get all their fingers up at once or not  I dont understand, holding the Christian flag and the American flag, what exactly theyre flipping off.

11951,Strickland switches on gun rights,"WASHINGTON - There was nothing subtle about the TV commercial in 2010. As Gov. Ted Strickland held a hunting rifle, an announcer said that as a member of the U.S. House in 1994, Republican gubernatorial candidate John Kasich ""voted to take away our gun rights - a major reason the National Rifle Association gave Strickland an A-plus rating."" Fast-forward to today, and the same Ted Strickland, who faces a contested U.S. Senate Democratic primary race in March against Cincinnati City Councilman P.G. Sittenfeld, has become an advocate of the type of gun restrictions he once opposed. WASHINGTON - There was nothing subtle about the TV commercial in 2010. As Gov. Ted Strickland held a hunting rifle, an announcer said that as a member of the U.S. House in 1994, Republican gubernatorial candidate John Kasich ""voted to take away our gun rights - a major reason the National Rifle Association gave Strickland an A-plus rating."" Fast-forward to today, and the same Ted Strickland, who faces a contested U.S. Senate Democratic primary race in March against Cincinnati City Councilman P.G. Sittenfeld, has become an advocate of the type of gun restrictions he once opposed. It is one of the most-dramatic reversals in Ohio politics since 1990, when Democratic gubernatorial candidate Anthony J. Celebrezze jettisoned his lifelong opposition to abortion rights, a move that hurt him in the general election when he lost to Republican George V. Voinovich. And even as Strickland's aides insist that he became an advocate of new gun restrictions in the wake of the shooting deaths of 20 children and six adults in 2012 at a Connecticut elementary school, some analysts suggest the former governor realizes that opposition to gun restrictions could hurt him among Democratic primary voters who tend to back tougher gun laws. The winner of the primary race between Sittenfeld and Strickland will face Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who almost certainly will have support of gun-rights organizations. The issue has intensified in the wake of mass shootings in Colorado Springs, Colo., last month when three people were killed at a Planned Parenthood facility, and this month in San Bernardino, Calif., where two Islamic State sympathizers killed 14. ""People's opinions really do change over time,"" said John Green, director of the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron. ""But the political problem is, when a candidate is strongly committed to a particular point of view, advertises about it, and then changes their mind in the run-up to a campaign, this raises a lot of suspicions."" To Sittenfeld, Strickland's reversal smacks of ""an election-year conversion. No one can erase or run from his record, and his record on guns is long and it's crystal clear."" Strickland's staff members declined requests to make the former governor available for an interview. But David Bergstein, a Strickland spokesman, said, ""Ted's views about gun violence and gun safety have been deeply influenced as a result of the multiple horrific incidents of gun violence that our country has suffered, and particularly after the Sandy Hook tragedy (in Connecticut). ""Just like many Americans, after Sandy Hook, he called for a reassessment of laws in order to help keep Ohioans and all Americans safer,"" Bergstein said. In particular, Bergstein said Strickland would have supported a bill sponsored in 2013 by Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania that would have expanded criminal-background checks to people buying guns at gun shows or on the Internet. The bill failed to pass the Senate. Bergstein said Strickland wants to ban those on the terrorist no-fly list from buying guns, adding that the former governor ""believes that stopping the epidemic of gun violence is too important for any politician to try and play games with, and his most important priority will always be to keep Ohioans safe."" When asked to produce any statement Strickland made before this year about changing his views on gun control, the Strickland campaign cited articles from the Associated Press and Wooster Daily Record from December 2012 when he called for a commission to consider the nation's gun laws. ""This country is facing a culture of violence that is intolerable and cannot just simply be accepted as a way of life,"" Strickland was quoted as saying in the Daily Record. ""I think the NRA, I think the entertainment industry, I think the political class all need to sit down, and we need to avoid the extremes,"" adding that ""there needs to be a recognition that we cannot continue to lose thousands and thousands of innocent people to gun violence."" Dale Butland, a Sittenfeld spokesman, said Strickland's comments from 2012 are ""why people don't trust career politicians."" ""Three years ago, after 20 first-graders were slaughtered by a lunatic with an assault rifle, the best Ted Strickland could do was call for a government commission to 'study' the problem. ""Not one word about changing his mind on background checks,"" Butland said. ""Not one word about reversing his position on assault weapons. And not one word about these or any other gun-related issues after all the other mass shootings that have occurred since Sandy Hook."" But David Leland, former chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party and a Strickland supporter, said, ""The whole country is moving in a more thoughtful direction on the gun issue. ""I don't think Ted Strickland is different than the vast majority of people in this country who recognize the Second Amendment but also realize with any kind of freedom there also needs to be some restrictions that apply to them,"" said Leland, now a state representative from Columbus. During his years in the U.S. House and as governor, there was nothing lukewarm about Strickland's support of gun rights. As a U.S. House member from Lucasville in 1994, he voted against a ban on the production and sale of 19 semiautomatic assault weapons, calling it a ""misdirected effort aimed at law-abiding citizens."" By contrast, Kasich, a Republican from Westerville, supported the ban, which prompted Strickland's commercial attacking Kasich during the 2010 gubernatorial race. In 1993, Strickland joined 68 other House Democrats in voting against the Brady Bill, which required a waiting period before anyone could buy a handgun as well as creation of an instant criminal-background check before people could buy any kind of gun. ""We endorsed him for governor in 2010,"" said Jim Irvine, president of the Buckeye Firearms Association. ""But since then he has kind of really fallen off into all sorts of nonsense on this issue. ""I can't imagine that somebody who knows what he knows (on gun laws) can take the positions he is,"" Irvine said. ""He is absolutely wrong, and he should know he's wrong."" _EMAIL_ @jacktorry1",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2016/may/13/fighting-ohio-pac/fighting-ohio-pac-ad-takes-ted-stricklands-mixed-a/,Politics,Polifact
12558,Remarks by the President at DNC Hope Fund Dallas Reception,"Gilleys Club Dallas, Texas 10:14 A.M. CST THE PRESIDENT: Hello, Dallas, Texas! (Applause.) Oh, it is good to see all of you! (Applause.) Everybody, please have a seat. Have a seat. It is good to see you on a Saturday morning. (Applause.) Theres a good-looking crowd here. You know, I think Ron Kirk wants to run for something again. (Laughter.) Matrice, he came up here, hes starting to get kind of -- he was getting into it, wasnt he? (Laughter.) I'm telling you. Listen, I love me some Ron Kirk. I really do. It's true I love Matrice more. (Laughter.) But Ron and Matrice could not be better friends. And he was not only a great mayor of this city, but he was a great ambassador on our behalf all across the country. So please give him a big round of applause. (Applause.) Your current Mayor, Mike Rawlings, is here. (Applause.) He reminds me that he had to clean up all kinds of stuff after Ron was mayor, but -- (laughter) -- it's turned out okay. One of our most wonderful representatives, and somebody whos been an incredible friend and partner to me over the years during my presidency -- Eddie Bernice Johnson. Give her a big round of applause. (Applause.) She's always had my back. And Hall-of-Famer -- (applause) -- and dear friend and really a pretty good dancer -- Emmitt Smith is in the house. (Applause.) Looking sharp in his three-piece. So I came to Texas because I wanted to visit South by Southwest yesterday. And I had a great time. And it's a fun event, it's an interesting event. For those of you who have not been there, theres a lot of tech folks and new ideas. And I was slotted among a panel -- there were a bunch of different panels, like Keep Mars Weird was one panel. (Laughter.) And then there was Robot Armageddon. That was another panel. (Laughter.) And I decided to keep quiet and not remind people that there actually is a robot rover on Mars. They might have not -- anyway. (Laughter.) But it was wonderful to be in Austin. It's wonderful to be in Dallas. And were here today because we know how deeply this years elections matter. If anybody tells you elections do not matter, think about 2008. Some of you were along for that ride. You know how much that election mattered. And the one after that. Because when I took office, we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, and unemployment was on its way to 10 percent. And today, our businesses have created jobs for 72 straight months -- six straight years; 14.3 million new jobs. (Applause.) Unemployment below 5 percent. Thats change. That's what we fought for. That's why elections matter. (Applause.) When I took office, American manufacturing was in a decade of decline and the auto industry was flat on its back. And today, the auto industry just had its best year ever. (Applause.) And over the past six years, weve created 900,000 new manufacturing jobs. Thats why elections matter. That's what change is all about. (Applause.) When I took office, tens of millions of Americans went without the security of health insurance. And today, thanks to the Affordable Care Act -- also known as -- AUDIENCE: Obamacare! THE PRESIDENT: -- Obamacare, 20 million more Americans are covered. (Applause.) And for the first time ever, more than 90 percent of Americans have health insurance. That is change. And they said it was going to kill jobs, but ever since I signed that bill into law, our businesses have created jobs every single month right here in the United States of America. (Applause.) When I took office, we were hopelessly addicted to foreign oil. Today, weve cut our imports by more than half. Oil and natural gas production in the United States is at an all-time high, but we've also tripled the power we generate from wind. (Applause.) We generate 30 times more solar power than we did when I came into office -- (applause) -- leading the world to combat climate change; creating good, new clean-energy jobs. That's change that you can believe in. That's why elections matter. (Applause.) When I took office, 180,000 troops were serving in harms way in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, about 90 percent of those folks are home. And we could not be more grateful for their service and their sacrifice. And we are also glad that they are reunited with their families. (Applause.) And we still have a job to do going after ISIL and those who would do us harm. But were pursuing a broader vision that uses every element of our national power, including diplomacy, to keep America safe and to keep America strong. (Applause.) When I took office, the right to marry who you love was limited to two states. Now it's in all 50 states, from coast to coast. Thats change you can believe in. (Applause.) So weve been busy. (Laughter.) We've been busy. We've been as busy as a one-eyed dog in a smokehouse. (Laughter.) I heard that saying while I was down here. (Applause.) And were still busy, still hustling -- got more work to do. When cynics told us we could not change this country that we love so much they were wrong. If somebody had told you seven years ago that wed have 4.9 percent unemployment, and 20 million newly insured, and gas at a buck-eighty, and deficits cut by three-quarters, and marriage equality a reality, and bin Laden out of the picture -- you wouldnt have bought what they were selling. Youd have said, oh, they were just hollering down a well. (Laughter.) But the truth of the matter is America is pretty darn great right now. (Applause.) America is making strides right now. America is better off than it was right now. The American people should be proud about what weve achieved together over the last eight years since the recession hit. We're great right now! (Applause.) And what the folks who are running for office should be focused on is how we can make it even better. Not insults and schoolyard taunts, and manufacturing facts. (Applause.) Not divisiveness along the lines of race or faith. Certainly not violence against other Americans or excluding them. Were a better country than that. And whats been happening in our politics lately is not an accident. For years, weve been told we should be angry about America, and that the economy is a disaster, and that were weak and that compromise is weakness, and that you can ignore science and you can ignore facts, and say whatever you want about the President, and feed suspicion about immigrants and Muslims and poor people, and people who arent like us, and say that the reason that America is in decline is because of those people. That didnt just happen last week. That narrative has been promoted now for years. It didnt just spring out of nowhere. And of course, none of it has been true. It just ignores reality -- the reality that America is the most powerful nation on Earth. The reality that our economy is not only stronger than it was eight years ago, that its, right now, the bright spot in the world. That our diversity is a strength -- a great gift -- that makes us the envy of every other nation. (Applause.) So the narrative that's been pushed is false. Demonstrably false. And we shouldnt be surprised then when, in the heat of political season, it starts getting carried away. But we've got to say no to that. We can have political debates without turning on one another. We can have political debates without thinking that the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice. We can support candidates without treating their opponents as unpatriotic, or treasonous, or somehow deliberately trying to weaken America. That's not just one candidate whos been saying that; some of the so-called more responsible candidates, including a gentleman from this state -- no, no, you read what he says, it's not -- it's no more rooted in reality than some of these other statements. We can point out bad policies without describing them as a government takeover or an assault on freedom. And by the way, when I say this, this is not about political correctness. Its about not having to explain to our kids why our politics sounds like a schoolyard fight. We shouldnt be afraid to take them to rallies, or let them watch debates. They watch the way we conduct ourselves. They learn from us. And we should be teaching them something about this democracy is a vibrant and precious thing. It's going to be theirs someday, and we should be teaching them how to disagree without being disagreeable, and how to engage, and how to analyze facts, and how to be honest and truthful, and admit if you make a mistake, and teach them that politics at its best is about a battle of ideas, and resolving our differences without encouraging or resorting to violence. And our leaders, those who aspire to be our leaders should be trying to bring us together, and not turning us against one another -- (applause) -- and speak out against violence, and reject efforts to spread fear or turn us against one another. (Applause.) And if they refuse to do that, they dont deserve our support. (Applause.) The best leaders, the leaders who are worthy of our votes, remind us that even in a country as big and diverse and inclusive as ours, what weve got in common is far more important than what divides any of us. In 2008, we had rallies with 50,000, 80,000, 100,000 people. I'm not bragging, I'm just saying we had -- (applause) -- we had some big rallies. Sometimes you hear folks say, oh, that rally is big. I say, I don't know. (Laughter.) We had some pretty big rallies. (Applause.) I'm just saying. We had one in Austin, Texas -- Ron remembers this, he was there -- 20,000 people, more than 20,000 people back in Austin. And I was telling the folks down in Austin, you remember -- I saw a guy, he had a nice-looking black cowboy hat. I said, that's a nice hat. And he took it off and he handed it to me. He said, you take it. And it fit really good. (Laughter.) I looked really good in it, and somebody took a picture of it. But I can't find that hat. AUDIENCE: Awww -- THE PRESIDENT: So if you're still out there, sir -- (applause) -- (someone tries to hand the President his cowboy hat.) No, man, that looks good on you, brother, but I -- when I come down to shake hands I may see if it fits. (Applause.) That's why I love Texas, right there. (Applause.) But my point, going back -- I got a little waylaid -- Americans were frustrated back then, too -- upset about the wars in Iraq, anxious about the housing crisis, anxious about the financial crisis that eventually would send the markets plunging and unemployment soaring, and people losing their homes and their pensions. And all that happened while we were campaigning. But somebody who went to those rallies, there wasnt a spirit of anger or meanness. People were hopeful. People were looking about how do we bring folks together. We tried to offer something different. We tried to offer something better. We believed that we were greater together; that were not as divided as our politics suggest. (Applause.) And as Democrats, thats what weve got to keep offering now -- a politics that reflects the best in us, and not the worst in us. (Applause.) Weve got to strive to hold ourselves to a higher standard. We've got to do better. We've got to offer a better path for America. And we know what we believe -- and by the way, when you know what you believe, when you know what you're for, you don't have to spend all your time trying to find somebody to be against. (Applause.) We believe the economy grows faster when everybody gets a fair shot, not just a few people. And we're not going to let Republicans roll back our progress by letting big banks or hedge funds make their own rules at the expense of everybody else. Were going to build on our progress, and rebuild our infrastructure, raise the minimum wage, and make college more affordable; and meet our obligations to the poor and the vulnerable; and work on family leave and paid leave and early education, so that everybody gets a shot at life. (Applause.) That's what we believe. Thats what we're about. We're for something, not just against something. (Applause.) AUDIENCE MEMBER: Four more years! THE PRESIDENT: No, I can't do that. We believe that in a country as wealthy as ours, everybody should have access to health care. And we made progress, but we've got more to do. Right here in Texas, your governor could cover over a million more Texans under Medicaid with the stroke of a pen -- (applause) -- 40,000 women could get mammograms that need it each year with the stroke of a pen. He wont do it -- not because it's not the right thing to do, but because of politics. And we should not be putting peoples health ahead of politics -- we should be putting peoples health ahead of politics. (Applause.) Shouldnt be putting politics ahead of health care. (Applause.) As Democrats, we believe in things like science. (Applause.) It has resulted in great improvements in our lives. Science -- that's why we have things like penicillin and airplanes. (Laughter.) So we appreciate science. We appreciate scientists. And when scientists tell us that climate change is real, we should not be wasting time debating whether climate change is real. Were working together to make sure we create good clean energy jobs that pay better than average. Right now, here in Texas, wind power is already cheaper than dirty fossil fuels. We can't let Republicans roll back this progress by letting special interests write their own rules, and just keep on subsidizing the past instead of investing in the future. (Applause.) Thats what we believe in. We're not just against something, we're for something. (Applause.) Does anybody have any idea what the other side is for right now? AUDIENCE: No! AUDIENCE MEMBER: What are they for? THE PRESIDENT: I don't know. (Laughter.) Q They don't either! THE PRESIDENT: They don't. That's why theyre selling wine. (Applause.) I had to say to -- I told the folks down in Austin, I said, has anybody bought that wine? (Laughter.) I want to know what that wine tastes like. (Laughter.) I mean, come on, you know that's like some $5 wine. (Laughter.) They slap a label on it, they charge you $50, saying this is the greatest wine ever. (Laughter.) Come on! (Laughter.) Oh, boy -- selling wine. (Laughter.) That's not what we're for. Couldn't make it up. (Laughter.) As Democrats, our top national security priority is protecting the American people, going after terrorist networks. For over a year and a half, we've led a coalition of more than 60 countries, hunting down and destroying ISIL -- going after their financial networks; going after their leadership; going after their infrastructure. We don't do it with phony bluster. We don't go around talking stuff; we do. (Applause.) More 10,000 airstrikes. Our men and women in uniform, our Special Forces right there taking care of business. Progress is not made by over-the-top claims and suggestions that we're going to carpet-bomb innocent people. That doesnt strengthen Americas leadership around the world. We don't strengthen our position, our standing, we don't make ourselves safer by insulting Muslims around the world, pitting groups of Americans against each other. Were going to keep America safe and strong and respected around the world by doing the right thing -- (applause) -- and using all the elements of our power. Thats what Democrats believe in. (Applause.) That's what we believe in. That's what we're for. We're not just against something. As Democrats, by the way, we believe our right to vote should be easier to exercise, not harder. (Applause.) I love folks who say how much they love the Constitution, love the American way, and then do everything they can to make sure that Americans can't vote. (Applause.) Right here in Texas, Republicans have systematically made it harder to register, and harder to vote. Four years ago, Texas ranked in the bottom five in voter turnout. Two years ago, it ranked in the bottom three; 16 million eligible voters, 7 million unregistered. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Wow! THE PRESIDENT: And that's not an accident. It's on purpose. It's systematically been structured to prevent more folks from voting -- discourage more folks from voting. So I'll tell you what Democrats believe. We believe that despite those efforts, we're going to go ahead and make sure we've got big turnout. (Applause.) We're going to prove everything is bigger in Texas, and get more folks registered, and get them to the polls. (Applause.) Tell them, Dont Mess with Texass right to vote! (Applause That's what we believe in -- that everybody should participate, everybody should be involved, everybody has got a voice, everybody has got a say! (Applause.) Our country works better that way. Black, white. Asian, Latino. Gay, straight. Immigrant, native-born. You look around this state -- it's home to everybody. People from all kinds of places. Thats what makes the Lone Star State great. That's what makes America great. And that's why I'm proud to be a Democrat -- because that's what the Democratic Party looks like. (Applause.) We believe at our core that everybody deserves an equal shot. We fight for people who haven't had the same chances we have; fight for kids who may not have the same opportunities that our kids have, no matter where they are, what they look like, where they come from. We believe they should be able to make it. We look out for somebody elses kids, not just our own, because we know when our kids grow up, then theyll be living in a better world if somebody elses kid has a chance, too. That's what we stand for. That's what we stand for as Democrats. That's what we stand for as Americans. Thats whats at stake this year. Thats why Im so proud to have all of you on our team. (Applause.) So lets get to work, Dallas! Lets get to work, Texas! (Applause.) Lets move this country forward! Lets remember what we're for -- lets not just be against something. Lets lift up hope! (Applause.) Lets remind ourselves of just how much progress we've made and that when people who love their country decide to come together, nothing can stop them. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. (Applause.) Thank you. (Applause.) END 10:38 A.M.

13053,Supreme Court vacancies in presidential election years,"In the wake of the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, questions have arisen about whether there is a standard practice of not nominating and confirming Supreme Court Justices during a presidential election year. The historical record does not reveal any instances since at least 1900 of the president failing to nominate and/or the Senate failing to confirm a nominee in a presidential election year because of the impending election. In that period, there were several nominations and confirmations of Justices during presidential election years. The first nomination during an election year in the twentieth century came on March 13, 1912, when President William Taft (a Republican) nominated Mahlon Pitney to succeed John Marshall Harlan, who died on October 14, 1911. The Republican-controlled Senate confirmed Pitney on March 18, 1912, by a vote of fifty to twenty-six. President Woodrow Wilson (a Democrat) made two nominations during 1916. On January 28, 1916, Wilson nominated Louis Brandeis to replace Joseph Rucker Lamar, who died on January 2, 1916; the Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed Brandeis on June 1, 1916, by a vote of forty-seven to twenty-two. Charles Evans Hughes resigned from the Court on June 10, 1916 to run (unsuccessfully) for president as a Republican. On July 14, 1916, Wilson nominated John Clarke to replace him; Clarke was confirmed unanimously ten days later. On February 15, 1932, President Herbert Hoover (a Republican) nominated Benjamin Cardozo to succeed Oliver Wendell Holmes, who retired on January 12, 1932. A Republican-controlled Senate confirmed Cardozo by a unanimous voice vote on February 24, 1932. On January 4, 1940, President Franklin Roosevelt (a Democrat) nominated Frank Murphy to replace Pierce Butler, who died on November 16, 1939; Murphy was confirmed by a heavily Democratic Senate on January 16, 1940, by a voice vote. On November 30, 1987, President Ronald Reagan (a Republican) nominated Justice Anthony Kennedy to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Lewis Powell. A Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed Kennedy (who followed Robert Bork and Douglas Ginsburg as nominees for that slot) on February 3, 1988, by a vote of ninety-seven to zero. In two instances in the twentieth century, presidents were not able to nominate and confirm a successor during an election year. But neither reflects a practice of leaving a seat open on the Supreme Court until after the election. On September 7, 1956, Sherman Minton announced his intent to retire in a letter to President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and he served until October 15, 1956. With the Senate already adjourned, Eisenhower made a recess appointment of William J. Brennan to the Court shortly thereafter; Brennan was formally nominated to the Court and confirmed in 1957. The fact that Eisenhower put Brennan on the Court is inconsistent with any tradition of leaving a seat vacant. And in 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson nominated Abe Fortas, who was already sitting as an Associate Justice, to succeed Chief Justice Earl Warren, but the Fortas nomination was the target of a bipartisan filibuster  principally in reaction to the Warren Courts liberalism and ethical questions about Fortas, although objections were certainly also made that it was inappropriate to fill the seat in an election year. That filibuster prompted Homer Thornberry, whom Johnson nominated to succeed Fortas as an Associate Justice, to withdraw his name from consideration in October 1968, because there was no vacancy to fill. Moreover, the failure to confirm Fortas as the Chief Justice did not leave the Court short a Justice, because Chief Justice Earl Warren remained on the bench.

13104,D.C.'s Ban On Handguns In Homes Is Thrown Out,"A federal appeals court ruled yesterday that the District's longtime ban on keeping handguns in homes is unconstitutional. The 2 to 1 decision by an appellate panel outraged D.C. Mayor Adrian M. Fenty and other city leaders, who said that they will appeal and that gun-related crimes could rise if the ruling takes effect. The outcome elated opponents of strict gun controls because it knocked down one of the toughest laws in the country and vindicated their interpretation of the U.S. Constitution's language on the right to bear arms. The panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit became the nation's first federal appeals court to overturn a gun-control law by declaring that the Second Amendment grants a person the right to possess firearms. One other circuit shares that viewpoint on individual rights, but others across the country say the protection that the Second Amendment offers relates to states being able to maintain a militia. Legal experts said the conflict could lead to the first Supreme Court review of the issue in nearly 70 years. The District's law bars all handguns unless they were registered before 1976; it was passed that year to try to curb gun violence, but it has come under attack during the past three decades in Congress and in the courts. Yesterday's ruling guts key parts of the law but does not address provisions that effectively bar private citizens from carrying guns outside the home. Fenty (D) said the city is committed to pursuing additional appeals, adding: ""I am personally deeply disappointed and frankly outraged by this decision. It flies in the face of laws that have helped decrease gun violence in the District of Columbia."" City attorneys said that it would take at least 30 days for the court's decision to go into effect, during which time the District probably will file its appeal. During an appeal, which could last more than a year, the current law would remain in effect, the lawyers said. Fenty said city officials will ""do everything in our power to work to get the decision overturned, and we will vigorously enforce our handgun laws during that time."" The ruling was the latest development in four years of litigation waged by six D.C. residents who said they wanted to keep guns in their homes for self-defense. Alan Gura, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said, ""This is a tremendous victory for the civil rights of all Americans."" Senior Judge Laurence H. Silberman wrote the majority opinion, also signed by Thomas B. Griffith. Karen LeCraft Henderson dissented. All three were appointed by Republican presidents. ""We conclude that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms,"" Silberman said in the 58-page majority ruling. The residents filed their lawsuit -- Parker v. the District of Columbia-- months after then-Attorney General John D. Ashcroft declared that gun bans violate the Second Amendment. They were aided by the Cato Institute, a nonprofit group that advocates personal liberties. The suit said the ban on handgun ownership violates the Second Amendment, which states: ""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.""",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2016/mar/18/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-wrongly-says-merrick-garland-voted-ba/,Politics,Polifact

14249,Edward Fitzpatrick: Look! Up in the air! The 'Superman building' is vacant another year!,"As the sun set on 2015, Rhode Island's tallest building stood empty, concluding another year of vacancy. As the city below lit up with New Year's Eve revelry, the former Industrial Trust building's 1,500 windows remained dark. And as golden doors etched with art deco eagles reflected the soaring heights of the 26-floor building's storied past, Scotch tape held in place flimsy signs reflecting today's street-level reality: ""No Loitering."" Earlier in the day, the principal owner agreed to lead a tour of the tower that many call the ""Superman building"" because it resembles the Daily Planet building in the old ""Superman"" TV show. (On TV, it was actually Los Angeles City Hall). The tour began in the former Bank of America lobby  a grand space where marble floors, dark columns and high ceilings recall another era but where a counter-top calendar recalls the day that the bank moved out: April 12, 2013. David C. Sweetser, founder and principal of Massachusetts-based High Rock Development LLC, said he hopes to secure some sort of public support in the new year to spur redevelopment of the iconic skyscraper  either as apartments, offices, graduate student housing or some mix of uses. His New Year's wish for the property: ""We would like it to be contributing to the local economy. We would like it to be tenanted."" But in Rhode Island these days, subsidy can be a four-letter word. While New Year's Eve produced quite a few headaches, perhaps no hangover was as epic as the one that Rhode Islanders felt following the 38 Studios debacle. And while that ball was dropped five years ago, High Rock ran into opposition just last year when it sought $39 million in state money, plus city tax breaks and historic tax credits, to try to convert the Superman building into 278 apartments. On the other hand, 2016 will begin with work under way to convert the old South Street Power Station into Brown University offices and a state college nursing education center, and that project relied on some $50 million in state and federal tax credits, plus state lease payments that will total an estimated $6 million a year. Sweetser said he is ""encouraged by the vision"" shown by Governor Raimondo and Providence Mayor Jorge O. Elorza, who just completed their first years in office, and by House Speaker Nicholas A. Mattiello and Senate President M. Teresa Paiva Weed. He noted, for example, that the state has adopted new economic development ""tools,"" such as the Rebuild Rhode Island tax credit program, and that officials are trying to attract developers to the former Route 195 land in Providence. And he said that, in general, people are expressing more interest in the building's future than they have in years. ""In previous years, we were somewhat on the defensive. Now, I don't feel on the defensive,"" Sweetser said. ""It has taken us four years of discussions, education, planning, negotiations, to be where we are today, and we can just feel a vibrancy that we have not felt before, with people acknowledging there needs to be something done with 111 Westminster Street."" But why can't something be done with 111 Westminster without public aid? Sweetser, who lives in Wellesley, Massachusetts, said the reality is that Boston is just 60 minutes away and it's offering subsidies to developers who can charge higher rent than you can get in Providence, while construction costs are more or less equal. As a result, the Boston skyline ""is completely dominated by the cranes,"" he said. ""With subsidies  you mention that word and everyone kind of cringes,"" Sweetser said. ""We wish we didn't need subsidies. I'm sure the state wishes we didn't need them. But unfortunately, it's an economic reality. So either you have no subsidies and nothing will happen, or everybody has to compromise, including me."" With public support, ""you will have a contributing building with employees or tenants, paying taxes, contributing to the economic welfare of the city and the state,"" he said. High Rock spokesman William Fischer said, ""Inactivity is not neutral. It is a negative. We have a hole in the skyline. If it were to be residential, you'd have an influx of 450 people here, going to restaurants, working, paying taxes."" Without subsidies, ""think about what this town would look like  there would be no Renaissance Hotel, no Arcade, no G Building, no Westminster corridor,"" he said. ""They used to call it the Renaissance City  it's time for a new renaissance."" But Samuel W. Bell, state coordinator of the Rhode Island Progressive Democrats, isn't buying it, and his comments are one indication of the opposition that could come from both the right and the left. ""They bought it for more than it was probably worth,"" he said of High Rock's $33.2-million purchase in 2008. ""But I don't think it's the role of the public to bail out businesses that make decisions that aren't good."" High Rock could sell the building at a loss, Bell said. ""But I think they are sitting on it, waiting for a big subsidy. So this is a case where the culture of subsidies is discouraging development, and it's creating this large eyesore."" Bell, who helped lead a successful battle against a Providence baseball stadium proposal that called for public funding, said, ""The people of Rhode Island are fed up with the culture of corporate welfare. To me, it is symbolic of developers refusing to accept what the market has said and asking for a big state handout."" Also, he said he's concerned the project could end up producing ""luxury apartments"" and ""severely exacerbate the affordable-housing crisis that Providence faces."" Providence Foundation leaders recently wrote an opinion piece calling for a ""feasible reuse"" of the building. ""The building presents an opportunity to create an asset for the community similar to public-private projects such as the Shepard/University of Rhode Island building, the Masonic Temple/Renaissance Hotel and South Street Landing,"" chairman William F. Hatfield and executive director Daniel A. Baudouin wrote. ""City and state leaders and the developer should come together in a public process in early 2016 to identify a creative and exciting solution for this iconic building. Like all historic restoration projects, this redevelopment will require state assistance."" Cliff Wood, the Providence Foundation's director of public advocacy, said, ""We are still reeling from other bad decisions in the past, but this one is a lot more solid, both literally and figuratively."" And having the state's tallest building out of commission ""smack in the middle of the capital, between City Hall and the federal building, is a symbolic as well as literal detriment to our goals,"" he said. In 2015, talk of Citizens Bank moving into the Superman building surfaced and faded. So does Sweetser have specific plans and requests that he plans to bring to the governor and legislative leaders in 2016? ""We will have those,"" he said, ""but we don't have those today."" He did mention Raimondo's Rebuild Rhode Island tax credit program  and the $15-million cap that the legislature placed on credits for any one project. ""We are enthused that the program was reinstituted,"" he said. ""The problem is it has a cap of $15 million. That's OK for the majority of buildings. It's unfortunately a constriction on a building this big."" While developers have walked away from other projects in Providence, Sweetser said, ""Let's say I walked away. Whoever comes in has the same challenge. Even if they get the building for zero, you cannot build for the uses given previously without subsidies. It has nothing to do with me. It has nothing to do with our plan. Period. Subsidies are a requirement for the building to go forward."" What about knocking the building down, as some have suggested? Fischer said, ""That is the wrong crane to bring in here. This building should be celebrated and its rehabilitation should be heralded. This is part of our history. It's been part of our skyline. You are never going to build another one like this."" From top to bottom, the building contains some unique features. For example, the basement houses a safe with a 17-ton steel door hanging from enormous hinges that holds some 5,000 safe-deposit boxes. And the penthouse level contains the ""Gondola Room,"" said to resemble the gondola of a dirigible, with cracked leather covering the doors, a built-in wooden wine rack standing empty and an oval window providing a bird's-eye view of the city. Speaking of birds, a nesting box for peregrine falcons can be seen from the windows of the 29th-level penthouse. And as 2015 came to a close, you could see that while they don't pay rent, these birds of prey are now the Superman building's only tenants. _EMAIL_ (401) 277-7368 On Twitter: @FitzProv",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2016/jan/17/david-sweetser/superman-developer-why-he-needs-subsidies/,Politics,Polifact
16111,Scott Walkers Blueprint for Americas Renewal Gets 10 Lines in the New York Times,"Scott Walkers Blueprint for Americas Renewal Gets 10 Lines in the New York Times RUSH: The New York Times. What is this, a tiny little paragraph? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 lines. National Briefing, Midwest. Its page A14 of the New York Times today. Heres the headline: Wisconsin: Assembly Passes Governors Tax-Cut Plan  The Wisconsin Assembly has passed Gov. Scott Walkers $504 million tax-cut plan. The chamber approved the bill on Tuesday by a vote of 61 to 35. It wasnt even close. The Senate passed it earlier this month. Assembly approval sends the bill on to Mr. Walker for his signature. The governor wants to use a portion of the states projected $977 million surplus to pay for cuts in property and income taxes. The solution to this countrys problems gets 10 lines in the New York Times. Im amazed they even ran the story, but it gets 10 lines. I think this is one of the biggest and most under-commented on, including in conservative media, stories this year. This is simply huge, what Governor Walker has done. No matter how you look at this, A, lets look at Wisconsin. One of the bluest of blue states. One of the bluest of the blue universities. One of the headquarter states for malcontent state unions. One of the headquarter states for malcontent Democrat Party union activism. They did everything they could not just to destroy Walkers political career; they tried to destroy his reputation and his political life. They attempted to recall him a couple of times. The Democrats in the Senate walked out. He persevered. He overcame. He dominated, and he won. And in the bluest of blue states unemployment is around 3.5%. The schools have been reformed and so the unions do not control every aspect of it now. There is a surplus of nearly a billion dollars in this economy. Theres no oil fracking going on there like there is next door in the Dakotas. There is a near $1 billion surplus and hes returning half of that to the residents of the state in the form of a property tax cut and income tax cut, and it rates 10 lines in the New York Times. Elsewhere across the country we have economic decay, frustration, unemployment, no job prospects, certainly no career prospects. Weve got the answer in practical and real political terms and real-life experience  and particularly for the Republican Party, the blueprint for how to win elections and the blueprint for how to govern after you win elections, the blueprint for economic revival, the blueprint for employment revival, the blueprint for budgetary solvency. Its amazing! It is a huge story. I interviewed Governor Walker for the Limbaugh Letter two issues ago, maybe the current issue. The upcoming interview, by the way, Bill Donohue, the Catholic League, and that is also fascinating. Youve got to read that. Youve got to read the upcoming issue of the Limbaugh Letter with Bill Donohue, the Catholic League. But this interview with Scott Walker in the preceding issue is just indescribably good. I just ask a couple questions and get out of the way. The Democrats are living in mortal fear that this is gonna be discovered. The Democrats are living in mortal fear that this is gonna be uncovered, discovered, massively, widely reported. Theyre living in mortal fear that the Republicans are gonna get their butts in gear and learn from this and try to replicate it. So far theres no sign of that. This is Paul Ryans state as well, and there are presidential rumblings for him. There are also presidential rumblings for Walker. I have no feeling on that. But, man, I was surprised to see this story in the New York Times. Just 10 lines as printed, and every important detail is there. Walker introduced a bill in January that would send $406 million to technical colleges to reduce their property tax hit and cut income taxes by $98 million by reducing the lowest bracket to 4% from 4.4%. So the poor are getting a tax cut. Everybody is, actually, cause property taxes are being cut. The end result would be a $131 reduction in a median homes tax bill this December and $46 in annual income tax savings for the average worker. I look at this, and I wonder why conservative media is not glomming onto this, and why the Republican Party isnt. But its worth paying a lot of attention to. By the way, Walker? When you listen to him talk, when you listen him campaign, he doesnt sound like any of these other Republican governors who wants to cross the aisle and work together and have bipartisanship. The Democrats didnt offer him any of that. The Democrats offered no cooperation whatsoever. All they offered was personal destruction. They threatened; they intimidated. They threatened harm against his family, these union people did, and he persevered. One of the reasons that so few people know about it is that hes not out beating his chest over all of this and trying to get people to look at him and then say, Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Hes just going about his business. I just want to take the occasion to congratulate him and to thank him again, by the way. Now, on the other side of this, whats the alternative? The alternative is what weve got going right now. The alternative is the Russians rebuilding the Soviet Union under Vladimir Putin, while Obama fills in his brackets for March Madness.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/apr/02/rush-limbaugh/wisconsin-heavily-democratic-state-and-yet-under-s/,Politics,Polifact

Now a Vidalia legislator facing a tough Republican primary has taken up the cause and would add a much bigger population for scrutiny: the states 1 million-plus food stamp recipients. Rep. Greg Morris hopes his revamped proposal will solve the legal problems of the 2012 welfare law, which was put on hold when a similar law in Florida was struck down over blanket searches. Under his bill, House Bill 772, the Department of Human Services couldnt demand a drug test of just any benefits applicant. Department workers would have to have a reason to suspect drug use by an individual: for example, if the applicant had previously applied for a job that also required drug testing; or his or her demeanor. Legislators who support the bill, which the House has already passed 107-66, said they saw no harm in drug-testing recipients of assistance when so many people have to be drug-tested for a job. A parade of charities, legal groups and other opponents of the bill, however, lined up at a Senate committee hearing Monday to call it cruel, ineffective, expensive and unconstitutional. Some complained about the vagueness of the demeanor provision and that DHS would not necessarily train workers to apply it. Only Morris testified in the bills favor, but it passed, on a party-line vote with the Republican chairwoman, Sen. Renee Unterman of Buford, intervening to break a tie. Morris said he understood why no one else spoke for his bill. What lobbyists are there for just the average worker whos a taxpayer? Morris said. Theyre economizing and buying inexpensive cuts of meat, when with (food stamps) you can buy lobster. Many food stamp users are workers. The less they make, the more food stamps they may receive, up to a maximum of $347 per month for a family of two with no income, according to DHS. In an interview, Morris called food stamps an out-of-control government program. He said its membership had exploded  not because of the recession, but because of lax eligibility standards  and should be reduced, perhaps by more than half. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, nine states, mostly in conservative areas, have passed drug-testing benefits legislation. Morris said during the hearing that he had worked to make sure the bill was not draconian. Anyone whose benefits are revoked can get them restored with a clean drug test after a certain period: one month on the first failed test, up to one year on the third failed test. Some people are exempt from testing, including people in nursing homes or people who DHS deems too handicapped to test. According to DHS, about 1.7 million Georgians receive food stamps (a program actually called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP), and 16,000 receive welfare (called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF). Many of those are children, who would not be drug-tested under the bill. A drug-testing program in Florida cost more to administer than it saved the state. But in Georgia, test-takers would pay the testing fee. I would submit to you that the vast amount of food stamp recipients can afford $17 to pay for the privilege of using the taxpayer-funded benefits, Morris said. Pass or fail, the recipient would pay the full cost of the test, unless that person qualified for Medicaid. Medicaid recipients would pay $17, or less if less was charged. Paradoxically, for the very poorest Georgians, the cost would probably be higher. In Georgia, because of a political standoff over Obamacare, people making less than the federal poverty level do not receive Medicaid. So they would pay full price. No child would have benefits revoked, Morris said. If a childs parents tested positive and lost their own benefits, they could designate a third person to spend their childs food stamps  under the assumption that the food purchased would all be given to the child. The bill still might cost the state. It contains a requirement that food stamp cards add a photo identifying the recipient, which opponents say could cost millions of dollars to add and was not funded in the bill. Morris said recipients might be required to pay the cost of the photo ID, too. Those potential costs, and the government intrusion into peoples lives, concerned Brett Bittner, the director of the Libertarian Party of Georgia. While we appreciate the idea of lessening the burden on the taxpayer, Bittner said, when you look at corporate subsidies and tax breaks and other takers of public money that arent going to be subject to this, it just seems like a way to punish those who are truly in need rather than actually trying to have a workable system. A similar program in Florida did find drug use among food stamp recipients. But the rate was lower than the rate among the population at large. Thats one piece of research cited in a 2013 federal court ruling that has halted drug-testing laws in Florida as well as Georgia. Its unclear whether that ruling, in the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, would also stop HB 772. The current laws are illegal because they dont meet the high standard for blanket searches without individualized suspicion, the ruling says. While HB 772 does take a crack at individualizing suspicion, the courts ruling also says that in most cases, the standard is met only with a judges warrant. This bill doesnt call for that. In addition, it would conflict with federal law, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture documents. Some opponents questioned why Georgia would join them when it might cost more than it saves and will certainly draw a court battle. Lee Burton has his own idea why. Hes biased. Burton, a Republican and a retired Navy SEAL, is challenging Morris for his seat. He claims Morris only championed the drug-testing idea after Burton opened his campaign in October, talking about making changes in welfare and social programs. And, Burton says, on the heavyweight issue where Morris was put in charge of  banking  he whiffed. Morris is chairman of the House Banks and Banking Committee, which oversees the states financial regulations and its bank regulators. In a state with the worst record of bank failures in the country since 2008, the committee has considered few bills that would stem the states rate of failing financial institutions. Morris says Burton is the one playing politics. If I was playing politics, Morris said, Id jump out and say, Im going to save the world as banking chairman. Weve heard legislation and were going to consider them in a businesslike way. Morris also indicated he wasnt worried about the primary. Ive been up here legislating, he said.

16335,"Sentencing reform already produced $20M savings, says Deal","ATLANTA | Gov. Nathan Deal told a University of Georgia alumni group this week that savings from his criminal sentencing reforms started almost immediately and now total $20 million per year. He also announced that hiring for most state jobs will no longer automatically eliminate ex-felons. They will at least get a personal interview. ""If you have a story to tell, you might have a shot at getting a job,"" he said, adding that he wants the state to serve as the test for private employers. Part of that money saved from the sentencing reforms has been earmarked in his proposed budget for pay raises and recruiting of prison guards. Part is also doubling what the state pays counties to house state inmates until the state finds one of its own cells for them. Speaking to graduates of UGA's School of Public and International Affairs at an Atlanta reception on Monday, the governor said he was surprised at the speed and size of the savings. ""I was amazed at the dollar figures ... and amazed at the time frame,"" he said. The reforms were implemented two years ago. They included reduced sentences for relatively minor crimes like writing bad checks and burglary as well as diverting addicts to community supervision and treatment through so-called accountability courts instead of the normal criminal system. Last year, Deal convinced the state Legislature to reform the juvenile justice system, gradually shifting responsibility to counties. He said he expects that to bring additional savings, but said it was too soon to know how much. This year, he is asking the Legislature for changes to help convicts scheduled for release be better prepared for life on the outside. One way is through improved education and job training while behind bars. He said a distance-learning program that has achieved recent successes for juvenile offenders can be adapted for adult prisons. He said he would be making what he called ""a major announcement"" soon about prison education. Despite the savings to taxpayers for the reforms, he said there are human benefits as well, such as reduced recidivism. ""We use big words like recidivism,"" Deal said.

16538,Cagle supports opt in on campus carry,"Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle said Wednesday he will support giving college leaders a say on whether students may carry guns on campus. With a new version of a controversial gun bill expected to be filed Friday, Cagle sat down with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution to talk about why he favors an opt in approach to guns, how quickly he wants to privatize parts of Georgias troubled foster care system and how to properly honor the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. On efforts to expand gun rights in Georgia: I have had a strong view of the protection of the Second Amendment and the right to bear arms. I dont really back away from that. I think its a fundamental right and were proud of our record. The two most controversial issues (in the gun proposal) are those of campus carry along with (allowing guns in) churches. Provided that there are the appropriate measures built around safety and the well-being and the concern of all, I could probably be comfortable with a campus carry approach. If an individual (such as a college or a church) wants to allow someone to be granted the right to carry under a concealed weapon permit, they should have that right. If they choose not to, then obviously the carry permit holder would have to respect that right. Theres discussion of the opt in or opt out provisions, and I think giving that school or that university or that church that ability is something that has some merit. On a push to privatize parts of Georgias foster care system: Were talking about kids who have nowhere else to turn but to foster care. We can do a better job. Were certainly not looking at a (complete) privatization, but I do think we are looking clearly at a public-private partnership that seeks out those vendors that have a strong mission and strong desire to protect kids. Were not going to prescribe a hard, ironclad type of approach. But what we are wanting to do is set up a basic framework and then give some discretion to the (state) agency. Its not going to be something that happens immediately. There are a number of steps that have to occur before we can really have something concrete in terms of implementation, but I do think that legislation needs to be put in place this year. On controversy over how to properly memorialize the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. at the state Capitol: We had the fortune of him being a Georgia native, and so I think it is important that we find ways that recognize him that are fitting. Hes the only person who has a portrait here in the Capitol in a designated position along with the other governors. A genuine and sincere conversation does need to be had. If I had to have a preference, I more than likely would support some type of monument as the most appropriate way to honor him thats fitting. Theres been a desire of many to look for a statue, and Im very open to that idea. On the return of Sen. Don Balfour, R-Snellville, after he was acquitted of filing false expense reports: Its been a high priority of mine to ensure in the Senate that we do rise above party politics. We had some controversy on the floor around Sen. Balfour, and the one person who came to his defense was the Dean of the Senate, whos a Democrat, Sen. Steve Thompson (of Marietta). The legal course has taken its action, and the Senate has also done various things and now its time to move on. Sen. Balfour is a good man, and is a man who can bring an awful lot of wisdom and knowledge to the debate in the Senate, so I look forward to what hes going to be able to do this session and future years. On how a short legislative session can be a good thing: For every week that were able to cut off of our timeline, it saves us approximately $100,000.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2014/mar/04/casey-cagle/cagle-state-saves-money-shorter-session/,Politics,Polifact
16970,Hundreds gather to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. at Ebenezer Baptist Church,"Political, community and faith leaders are gathering this morning to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. on what would have been the civil rights icons 85th birthday. Crowds packed into Ebenezer Baptist Church before 9 a.m. Monday, the 28th anniversary of a national holiday in Kings honor. Dignitaries including U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson, U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson, Gov. Nathan Deal and Mayor Kasim Reed addressed the audience of hundreds. Dr. King deserves all the praise and honor that is afforded him in ceremonies like this one which take place each year around the nation, Deal said. But I think more than just saying kind thoughts about him, we ought to take action ourselves. This is how we embed truth into our words. Deal pledged to give King a permanent presence at the state Capitol, but stopped short of giving specific details. Reed praised the sacrifices King made that allowed men like him and President Barack Obama to run for office. I think in moments like this, weve got to come back to our core and remember how it all happened, he said. Reed pledged to improve Martin Luther King. Jr. Drive in downtown Atlanta, a commitment he made last year as part of plans for the future $1.2 billion Atlanta Falcons stadium. Shame on me and shame on all of usthat Martin Luther King Jr. Drive looks like every other Martin Luther King Jr. Drive in the United States of America, he said. The Rev. Raphael Warnock, Ebenezers senior pastor, spoke about healthcare and income inequality during his keynote address, saying federal leaders should extend unemployment insurance. The crowd stood as he called for Deal to expand Medicaid, though Deal had left the service by that time. There is no reason not to expand Medicaid, he said. It is ours, not for the taking. We gave the money. Let the money come back. Previous speakers include Cornel West, the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, and Martin Luther King III. Bernice King, the leaders daughter and CEO of the King Center, presided over the event. She recognized the work of her mother, Coretta Scott King, in advancing Kings image from once-feared activist to icon. We will not forget Coretta Scott King, she said to cheers. She always belonged side by side with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Mondays celebration concludes a week and a half of events promoting themes of non-violence, including a gun buy-back program sponsored by the Atlanta chapter of the NAACP, a film screening, arts project and panel discussions on human trafficking. Hands on Atlanta reports 3,000 volunteers are expected to participate in a day of service Monday.

Chris Christie ended a campaign stop in Somers Point on Saturday with an argument with a public school teacher who showed up to protest his education policies. Melissa Tomlinson, a teacher at Buena Regional Middle School, said she asked the governor, Why are you portraying our schools as failure factories? He responded, What do you want? Im tired of you people, according to Tomlinson. They had a brief argument over public school funding before she said, He told me to do my job and turned around and got on the bus. Christie's spokeswoman, Maria Comella, disagrees with Tomlinson's characterization of the conversation. The governor did not say that he is ""tired of you people,"" Comella said. ""They were having a discussion about the (education) funding levels and the governor said that no matter how much money we spend, it will never be enough for you people,"" she said. The exchange was witnessed by a crowd of Christie supporters who had just listened to him give a campaign speech inside the VFW. The Republican governor faces Democrat Barbara Buono in Tuesdays election. I wanted to have a conversation with him, Melissa Tomlinson, a teacher at Buena Regional Middle School, said in a phone interview today.

Tomlinson is part of the New Jersey chapter of the Badass Teachers Association, whose Facebook page says: This page was created to help us further our cause in the fight against the 'deform' of public education in the state of New Jersey. Christie cut more than $1 billion in state aid to schools in his first year in office. He has since touted his administrations attention to public schools. He supports expanding charter schools and instituting a voucher program called the Opportunity Scholarship Act, which would give students in low-performing money for tuition in private schools. I would be happy to take as many dollars as possible away from failure factories that send children on a no-stop route to prison and to failed dreams, if we could take that money and put it into a place where those families have hope,"" Christie said last month during a speech to the Orthodox Union in Teaneck. Christie recently asked Education Commissioner Christopher Cerf to look into how taxpayer dollars are spent at New Jerseys private schools for disabled students, responding to a recent Star-Ledger investigation.

19180,Florida Democrats Ask HHS to Protect Floridians from High Insurance Premiums in Marketplace,"Florida Democrats Ask HHS to Protect Floridians from High Insurance Premiums in Marketplace f t # e Washington, DC, August 1, 2013 | (202-225-3001) In a letter sent today to U.S. Secretary Kathleen Sebelius led by Congressman Ted Deutch (FL-21), the Florida Democratic delegation in the House of Representatives slammed Governor Rick Scott and the Florida legislature for stripping the state of the authority to protect consumers from unreasonably high insurance premiums and called on the Department of Health and Human Services to take a more active role in reviewing rates in Florida. The Affordable Care Act encourages state regulators to review premium rates proposed by health insurance companies, but allows the federal government to engage in such reviews if a state is found to have inadequate protection for consumers. While the federal government determined in early May that Floridas Office of Insurance Regulation was legally capable of protecting consumers, on May 31, 2013 Governor Scott signed SB 1842 and explicitly forbid Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty from reviewing health insurance plans offered in the Marketplace for at least two years. In the letter, the Representatives write that the premium increases are not a coincidence, but rather the product of a cynical and intentional effort by Governor Scott and the Florida legislature to undermine the Affordable Care Act and make health insurance premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace more expensive by refusing to allow the Insurance Commissioner either to negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high. It is our hope that HHS will intervene on behalf of Florida consumers to ensure policies available on the Marketplace are fair and affordable. We believe HHS has the full authority under current law and federal regulations to undertake these actions. With two months remaining until the Marketplace is scheduled to open, we look forward to hearing from you regarding the actions the Department of Health and Human Services and CMS will take to protect Florida consumers  since Governor Scott, the Florida legislature, and Insurance Commissioner McCarty will not. Joining Rep. Deutch on the letter were Reps. Alcee L. Hastings, Corrine Brown, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Kathy Castor, Frederica S. Wilson, Joe Garcia, Alan Grayson, Lois Frankel, and Patrick E. Murphy. A text copy of the letter is available below. August 1, 2013 The Honorable Kathleen Sebelius Secretary U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 200 Independence Ave., SW Washington, DC 20201 RE: Florida Health Insurance Marketplace Premium Rates Dear Secretary Sebelius, It has become abundantly clear that a law enacted by Florida Governor Rick Scott and the state legislature could leave consumers vulnerable to unreasonably high premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace. Therefore, we write you to ask for your assurance that the Department of Health and Human Services will exercise its authority to protect consumers in our State. As you well know, the Affordable Care Act encourages state regulators to protect consumers from unreasonably high insurance premiums, in a process known as Rate Review. The law ensures that if states do not have an adequate Rate Review system in place, the federal government may step in to protect consumers from unjustifiable premiums. The time to step in is now. As of May 3, 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) determined that Floridas Office of Insurance Regulation operated an Effective Rate Review Program. Led by a state Insurance Commissioner, this office has long been charged by Florida law to review proposed insurance rates. Unfortunately, it appears that Florida Governor Rick Scott and the state legislature waited until CMS finalized this determination before passing a law to strip the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation of its authority to review insurance premiums and protect consumers. Signed into law on May 31st, 2013, Senate Bill 1842 forbids Floridas Insurance Commissioner from reviewing health insurance plans offered on the new Marketplace on behalf of Florida consumers for at least two years. In our view, the passage of this law invalidates CMSs determination that Florida had an effective Rate Review Program and thus necessitates that the federal government take up an expanded role in Florida to protect consumers. Indeed in other states, like Maryland that released its rates last week, where state insurance commissioners have Rate Review and full negotiating power, health insurance premiums are substantially lower. Over 3.9 million people in Florida are uninsured, and the availability of affordable coverage on Floridas new Marketplace will be vital to expanding coverage. This week, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty indicated that premiums for the plans that will be offered this October will increase between 30 and 40 percent in the individual market, and 5 to 20 percent in the small-group market. This is not a coincidence, but rather the product of a cynical and intentional effort by Governor Scott and the Florida legislature to undermine the Affordable Care Act and make health insurance premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace more expensive by refusing to allow the Insurance Commissioner either to negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high. Florida legislators also directed the Office of Insurance Regulation to ignore the significant tax credits for Floridians that will make health insurance even more affordable. While other states have reported great success in driving down premium rates proposed by insurance companies seeking to sell policies on their Marketplaces, officials in Florida have proactively abdicated any responsibility to protect consumers. The actions taken by Governor Scott and the legislature have made consumers vulnerable to the will of insurance companies, and it is time for the federal government to step in. The Affordable Care Act provides important consumer protections and protects Americans from unreasonable health insurance premiums. It is our hope that HHS will intervene on behalf of Florida consumers to ensure policies available on the Marketplace are fair and affordable. We believe HHS has the full authority under current law and federal regulations to undertake these actions. With two months remaining until the Marketplace is scheduled to open, we look forward to hearing from you regarding the actions the Department of Health and Human Services and CMS will take to protect Florida consumers  since Governor Scott, the Florida legislature, and Insurance Commissioner McCarty will not.

Rick Scotts State of the State address, Florida Democratic Party Chairwoman Allison Tant joined by Senators Darren Soto and Dwight Bullard along with Representatives Mark Pafford and Karen Castor Dentel gathered outside of the Governors office to discuss his record of putting big corporations and special interests ahead of Florida's middle class families. The press conference followed the release of a memo today outlining the Governor's State of Denial about his failed record. At the press conference Chairwoman Allison Tant underscored Floridians aren't buying Scott's new poll-tested rhetoric which does not match his record: ""After cutting more jobs than he created in Florida in 2012, failing to keep his promise to create 700,000 new jobs and a disastrous election year where the Florida GOP got their teeth kicked in, Gov. Rick Scott is running away from everything he campaigned on to get reelected. Thanks for the sudden interest in Floridas families, Governor. But your State of the State is nothing more than a State of Denial about your record of putting corporations and special interests ahead of middle class families -- and nobody is buying it."" We need to get our economy back on track for these families, but cutting our way to prosperity is just another part of Scotts State of Denial, said Sen. Darren Soto. Speaking about the lack of leadership from Rick Scott for Floridas economy, Soto said that no amount of election year about-faces on teacher pay and Medicaid expansion will convince Floridians that the Governor has their interests in mind. Teachers Senator Dwight Bullard and Representative Karen Castor Dentel spoke on the effects of Rick Scotts failed record on Floridas schools. We know his record, said Castor Dentel. ""If he wants to create jobs and improve Floridas economy he must start by properly funding our schools instead of giving tax breaks to big corporations at the expense of Floridas students. We need a lasting and substantial commitment to public education, not a soundbite, said Bullard. Rick Scott thinks he can just flip a switch and undo all of the harm he has done Well Governor, you need to walk the walk.

20977,Full text: Eric Cantors Make Life Work speech,"Today, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor delivered remarks at the American Enterprise Institute ""outlining a number of major policy initiatives designed to 'Make Life Work' for more people."" Cantors speech, as prepared for delivery, appears below. Wonkblog will have more analysis of the policies shortly. In Washington, over the past few weeks and months, our attention has been on cliffs, debt ceilings and budgets, on deadlines and negotiations. All of this is very important, as there is no substitute for getting our fiscal house in order. There is no greater moral imperative than to reduce the mountain of debt facing us, our children and theirs. The House Republican Majority stands ready for President Obama and his party to finally join us in our efforts to tackle the big problems facing America. But today, I'd like to focus our attention on what lies beyond these fiscal debates. Over the next two years, the House majority will pursue an agenda based on a shared vision of creating the conditions for health, happiness and prosperity for more Americans and their families. And to restrain Washington from interfering in those pursuits. We will advance proposals aimed at producing results in areas like education, health care, innovation and job growth. Our solutions will be based on the conservative principles of self-reliance, faith in the individual, trust in the family and accountability in government. Our goal  to ensure every American has a fair shot at earning their success and achieving their dreams. It is my hope that I can stand before you in two years and report back that our side, as well as the president's, found within us the ability to set differences aside, to provide relief to so many millions of Americans who simply want their life to work again. In so many countries throughout history, children were largely consigned to the same station in life as their parents. But not here. In America, the son of a shoe salesman can grow up to be president. In America, the daughter of a poor single mother can grow up to own her own television network. In America, the grandson of poor immigrants who fled religious persecution in Russia can become the Majority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives. In America, in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, two bicycle shop mechanics gave mankind the gift of flight. The Wright brothers flew only 22 feet, 18 feet in the air, but they performed a miracle. As a result, only 66 years later, this great country of ours put a man on the moon and brought him back. We can do an enormous amount. Thats who we are. The Wright brothers father, Milton, first inspired his sons with a toy helicopter. But he never wanted Orville and Wilbur to fly together, for fear he would lose them both. In 1910, seven years after the boys first flight, Milton gave them permission to fly together, the only time they ever did, and it lasted six minutes. Later that day, Orville took 82-year-old Milton on the only flight of his life. It lasted seven minutes, rising 350 feet, while his elderly father shouted: Higher, Orville, higher. What a great commentary. In America, we do have higher expectations for our nation. Since our founding, we believed we could be the best hope to mankind. That hope led generations of immigrants to risk everything, to endure a tough journey to our shores, looking for a better future. The driving motivation for millions of immigrants passing by Lady Liberty in New York Harbor was the generation that came after them. And because of that hope  those high expectations  coupled with a determination to see them come true, every generation since has had it better off than the one before. Until now. Lately, it has become all too common in our country to hear parents fear whether their children will indeed have it better than they have. And for all of us parents, that is a scary thought. Let's face it. It has gotten a lot tougher to raise a family here in America. Our goal should be to eliminate this doubt gripping our nations families, and to restore their hope and confidence so that parents can once again see a better tomorrow for their children. Together, my wife Diana and I raised our three children, Evan, Jenna and Mikey, and we couldn't be more proud of the young adults they have become. Our nest is now empty, but I understand the pressure all parents are under, and the trying times they go through. Parents working, saving for school, paying for braces, helping with homework and going from one after-school activity to the next. It's not easy. That's why we worry so much. Where can you find an affordable home in a good neighborhood to raise your kids? Which health-care plan can I afford that allows you to see your doctors? Will the children make it through high school and get into a college of their choice, and if so, can you afford it? What about a career? Will that be available to them? These are real-life concerns. This is what keeps parents awake at night fearful that life won't work out the way they hoped. During the last several years with the stagnant economy, too many mothers and fathers have had to come home, walk into the kitchen and tell their families they didnt have a job anymore. How does a family like that save for a rainy day, when it just got tough to even make it through the next month? These families are desperate to wake up in the morning and have the nightmare over. The best way to restore their hope for the future and to heal our country is by making opportunity a reality for them and everyone. This comes with a growing economy, business expansion and start-ups creating jobs. Just like parents, Washington must start showing care for the generations ahead while leaving the parenting to the parents. Government policy should aim to strike a balance between what is needed to advance the next generation, what we can afford, what is a federal responsibility and what is necessary to ensure our children are safe, healthy and able to reach their dreams. Opportunity and the belief in a better tomorrow start with an education system that works. In an 1822 letter, Thomas Jefferson wrote: I look to the diffusion of light and education as the resource to be relied on for ameliorating the condition, promoting the virtue, and advancing the happiness of man."" With an eye toward Mr. Jeffersons vision, since 1965, the federal government has poured hundreds of billions of dollars into improving schools in low-income areas  over $15 billion just last year. And frankly, the results have not matched the investment. Joining us here today is Joseph Kelley and his family. A heroic Dad, Joseph worried that the public school wasnt helping his son. Rashawn flunked the first grade, and by fifth grade was three years behind on most subjects. The school actually put him in special education classes. Joseph would try and sit in on classes in order to help Rashawn, but was met with hostility, and even had to obtain a court order so Rashawn could have a tutor. Violence was so prevalent in Rashawns schools that eight D.C. police officers patrolled it on a daily basis. Mr. Kelly heard of the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program and dedicated himself to making sure Rashawn and his three sisters could gain access to a school that would put them on a path to graduation, and college  an opportunity he himself did not have. Within two years at a private school, Rashawn caught up to his classmates, and is now a student at the University of the District of Columbia. And his sisters, Domonique, Shakeyta and Rhunetta, are attending the Preparatory School of D.C. and are on a similar path to opportunity. I visited this school yesterday, and it is impressive. The kids are in a safe environment, with great teachers, terrific administrators, small class sizes and a mission that every kid succeeds. No one should deny Rashawn and his sisters this opportunity. Joseph Kelley, nor any parent, should have to wait for failing school systems to get their acts together. Throughout the country there are promising signs that we can bring schools and parents together to improve our educational system. San Francisco public schools adopted a funding mechanism according to whats termed a ""weighted student formula."" Under this policy, the more students a school attracts, the more money that school, its administrators and teachers receive. Low-income students are weighted heavier in the funding formula, as are children with disabilities, and those learning English as a second language. So, there's incentive for schools to seek the more vulnerable population, and reasons for schools to differentiate themselves and excel. Imagine if we were to try and move in this direction with federal funding. Allow the money we currently spend to actually follow individual children. Students, including those without a lot of money or those with special needs, would be able to access the best available school, not just the failing school they are assigned to. And their options ought to include not just public schools or private schools, but also charter schools. A competitive environment, where schools compete for students rather than the other way around, gives every child from the inner city of Washington to the streets of Los Angeles, an equal chance at a greater destiny. One of our priorities this year will be to move heaven and earth to fix our education system for the most vulnerable. And when those children graduate from high school, we must expand their choices and college should be a viable option. In 1980, the average cost of college was roughly $8,000 a year. Today, it is over $20,000, and less than 60 percent of the students who enroll in a four-year program graduate within six years. Clearly, something is broken. According to President Obamas former jobs council, by 2020 there will be 1.5 million jobs without the college graduates to fill them. While there is a persistent unmet demand of 400,000 to 500,000 job openings in the health-care sector alone. Recent reports indicate there are not enough applicants with the skills necessary to fill the jobs in the booming natural gas industry in America. Suppose colleges provided prospective students with reliable information on the unemployment rate and potential earnings by major. What if parents had access to clear and understandable breakdowns between academic studies and amenities? Armed with this knowledge, families and students could make better decisions about where to go to school, and how to budget their tuition dollars. Students would actually have a better chance of graduating within four years and getting a job. Helping students realize opportunity and a career, while keeping tuition costs low, makes common sense. Senators Rubio and Wyden have a proposal that they unveiled here at AEI, which addresses this goal. I look forward to working with them and Chairman John Kline in pursuing legislative action in the House. Over the course of this Congress, we will also work to reform our student aid process to give students a financial incentive to finish their studies sooner. We will encourage entrepreneurship in higher education, including for-profit schools. And we will fix the way we subsidize education by making the costs more transparent to parents, students and the millions of taxpayers who help pay some of the bill. We owe it to them. A good education leads to more innovation. Throughout our history, American colleges and universities have served as the crucible for the world's innovation. They are a big part of why the United States remains the destination for the world's best and brightest. Investment in education leads to innovation, which leads to more opportunity and jobs for all. Our problem? The investment we make is not yielding maximum returns. Each year our colleges and universities graduate approximately 40,000 foreign nationals with Masters and PhDs, many of whom are then forced to leave the country because there are not enough visa slots in our immigration system to permit them to stay. So rather than being able to invent things here in America, grow businesses or start one on their own, they do all of those things somewhere else. Fiona Zhou is here today. She is earning her masters degree at the George Washington University School of Engineering and Applied Science. Originally from China, shes been in the U.S. for five years, studying operations research in the systems engineering department. Shes pretty smart. She would like to stay here and invest her talents in America, and maybe even start her own company. But she has seen too many of her friends with advanced degrees have to go back home despite sharing her same dreams and aspirations. Last year, the House passed the bipartisan STEM Jobs Act which helped fix this problem. We will act again in this Congress, and we hope the Senate chooses to join us this time. I look forward to Fiona realizing her dreams and our country reaping the rewards of her hard work and talent. Whether its college or the cost of day care, making life work for more families means reducing the economic insecurity plaguing so many working moms and dads. Over the last 20 years, the world has changed. It used to be that one could make a career out of working for one company. Today, the average worker stays at his or her job for barely four years. Median income in 2010 was about the same as it was in 1997. Experts correctly point out that this statistic ignores that many working families are getting more benefits like health care from their employer and not just wages. But, explaining that rising health-care costs are depressing take-home pay is little consolation to a working mom. Her grocery bills are higher, her kids' school needs are more expensive, rent is up  and now, she's just trying to get by. And getting by is not the American Dream. As job markets are changing, more skills training and education are needed. Federal jobs training programs ought to make it easier for Americans who are out of work or who are changing careers to get the skills they need. Yet today, the federal government has a patchwork of over 47 different overlapping programs that are not dynamic or innovative enough to meet the needs of employers or potential employees. We can fix this, and we should be able to muster bipartisan support to do so. If you're a working parent, you know theres hardly ever enough time at home to be with the kids. Too many parents have to weigh whether they can afford to miss work even for half a day to see their child off on the first day of school or attend a parent-teacher conference. Federal laws dating back to the 1930s make it harder for parents who hold hourly jobs to balance the demands of work and home. An hourly employee cannot convert previous overtime into future comp-time or flex-time. In 1985, Congress passed a law that gave state and municipal employees this flexibility, but today still denies that same privilege to the entire private sector. Thats not right. Theres a police officer at home in my district, her name is Vicki. She is working a tough job, with long hours, while raising her children. Her life is made a little easier because as a local government employee, she is permitted to work some extra hours and save it up for a sick day or a school event. Imagine if we simply chose to give all employees and employers this option. A working mom could work overtime this month and use it as time off next month without having to worry about whether she'll be able to take home enough money to pay the rent. This is the kind of common sense legislation that should be non-controversial and moves us in the right direction to help make life work for families. Another step we have to take is on taxes. There is a lot of talk about taxes in Washington right now. For most families, tax preparation is hard and it is time consuming  this time of year especially. Think about what theyre going through. What tax form are you supposed to fill out, is it more beneficial to file jointly as a married couple or separately? Is a truck or gas mileage deductible or are you forgetting something that the IRS gives you credit for? In 1935, the Form 1040 was accompanied by a two-page instruction booklet. Today, taxpayers must wade through over 100 total pages of instructions. Just filling out a W-4 at a new job is confusing. You shouldnt need a worksheet to know how many dependents you have. Chairman Dave Camp and his committee are already underway in the effort to responsibly rewrite our nation's tax laws. As in education policy, health care and all else, tax reform, should reflect the priorities of working families and the future they're trying to shape for their kids. If nothing else, we must stop putting special interests ahead of our working families best interests. Loopholes and gimmicks benefitting those who've come to know how to work the system in Washington, are no more defensible than the path of wasteful and irresponsible spending we've been on for decades. Working families should come first. Everyone agrees a fairer, simpler tax code would give us all more time. In our attempt to make the tax code simpler, we must continue to demonstrate support for young parents who invest in having kids and raising a family. They are America's most valued investors. In 1997, a Republican Congress created the child tax credit specifically to help ease the financial burden of families raising children. In 2001, it was expanded. Such a policy helps to limit the size of government and results in fewer Americans looking to the government for support. Leading up to April 15th, families will be besieged by concerns over their taxes. But its health care and a concern for a healthy family that always worry parents most. Most Americans have come to expect the best health care in the world. But theres no doubt our current system is too expensive and too complicated. President Obamas health-care law resulted in higher premiums and costs for families, and has made access to quality health care and innovation tougher. If we want to reverse this trend, we should start by choosing to repeal the new taxes that are increasing the costs of health care and health insurance, like the medical device tax. With us today is Erin Shucosky. Erin has been a clinical nurse for 30 years in Baltimore. She spent the past ten years coordinating the research on a study to approve new replacement discs to treat patients suffering from crippling neck and back pain. Over time, Erin discovered she suffered from the very condition her work aimed to treat. On her days off, Erin would spend time at her daughters lacrosse tournaments barely able to move, and would then go home and spend most of her time there with an ice pack on her neck. So she went in for surgery and got those new disc replacements. Erins in a cervical collar today, but thankfully shes on the mend. The new medical device tax in ObamaCare makes it harder for researchers to develop these innovative devices in the U.S. and thus makes it harder for patients like Erin to get the care they need. ObamaCare has unnecessarily raised the costs of our health care. Even those who have pre-existing conditions could get the coverage they need without a trillion dollar government program costing us all more. And thats only the tip of the iceberg when we talk about health-care reform. Many families, like mine, are dealing with the challenges presented by aging and very sick parents. They rely on Medicare for relief. In 1965 the federal government created Medicare modeled after the standard Blue-Cross Blue Shield insurance plan commonly available at that time. In the past 50 years both health care and health insurance have changed dramatically, but the government and Medicare have not kept pace. Medicaid isnt doing any better. Under the Medicaid system the rules are set in Washington, but much of the bills are paid in our state capitals. Collectively states are spending more on Medicaid than they do on K-12 education. And states dont have the flexibility to innovate in order to lower costs and provide better care. As a result, in many cases, patients have been swallowed up by the system, and have become an afterthought. These programs are broken, and many patients are going without proper care. That's not fair to the people who depend on these programs. Weve got to fix them. We can modernize Medicare so it isnt so complicated for seniors or health-care providers and make it easier for them to get the care they need in a cost effective manner. We should begin by ending the arbitrary division between Part A, the hospital program, and Part B, the doctor services. We can create reasonable and predictable levels of out-of-pocket expenses without forcing seniors to rely on Medigap plans. Seniors who choose to receive their health-care treatment through a group of doctors and hospitals working together to control costs, should share in the savings through lower Medicare premiums and out of pocket costs. This is both cost effective and good for seniors. We can provide states more flexibility with respect to Medicaid that will allow them to provide better care for low-income families in a way that ultimately lowers costs. Options for states should include streamlining the process for determining eligibility, and allowing them to offer health coverage through patient-directed health care or flexible benefit programs. And we must make it faster and simpler for states to gain approval of federal waivers to modify their Medicaid programs. Long term, controlling health-care costs will require smarter federal investments in medical research. Many of todays cures and life saving treatments are a result of an initial federal investment. And much of it is spent on cancer research and other grave illnesses. One of the most courageous people I know is a young girl from Richmond named Katie. Ive known Katie for many years. Katie was diagnosed with a brain tumor just after her first birthday. This is every parents worst nightmare. For years, she went through different treatments and therapies with little success. At age 7, she and her parents headed to St. Jude Childrens Hospital in Memphis. She had a positive radiation treatment and is doing well today, but this month she will again travel back to St. Jude as she often does. Katie became a part of my congressional offices family and even interned with us. We rooted for her, and prayed for her. Today, she is a bright 12-year-old that is making her own life work despite ongoing challenges. Katie is down here in the front row. Katie, thank you for being here with us. Prayers for Katies recovery help. But we also must pray that scientists and researchers find cures to these diseases so our parents and grandparents dont leave us too soon, or that children like Katie are not robbed of a healthy life. There is an appropriate and necessary role for the federal government to ensure funding for basic medical research. Doing all we can to facilitate medical breakthroughs for people like Katie should be a priority. We can and must do better. This includes cutting unnecessary red tape in order to speed up the availability of life saving drugs and treatments and reprioritizing existing federal research spending. Funds currently spent by the government on social science  including on politics of all things  would be better spent helping find cures to diseases. Scientific breakthroughs are the result of and have helped contribute to America's being the worlds capital of innovation and opportunity in nearly every field. For this and many other reasons, people across the globe want to become a part of our country. We must never diminish that desire, or worse, become a place that is no longer desirable. It's no secret that there are more than 11 million people here illegally, many of whom have become part of the fabric of our country. They, like us, have families and dreams. While we are a nation that allows anyone to start anew, we are also a nation of laws, and thats what makes tackling the issue of immigration reform so difficult. In looking to solve this problem soon, we must balance respect for the rule of law and respect for those waiting to enter this country legally, with care for the people and families, most of whom just want to make a better life, and contribute to America. A good place to start is with the kids. One of the great founding principles of our country was that children would not be punished for the mistakes of their parents. It is time to provide an opportunity for legal residence and citizenship for those who were brought to this country as children and who know no other home. Im pleased that many of my colleagues in both chambers of Congress on both sides of the aisle have begun work in good faith to address these issues. And Im pleased these discussions make border security, employment verification and creating a workable guest worker program an immediate priority. Its the right thing to do for our families, for our security, and for our economy. There are some who would rather avoid fixing the problem in order to save this as a political issue. I reject this notion and call on the president to help lead us towards a bipartisan solution rather than encourage the common political divisions of the past. A sonnet by Emma Lazarus, The New Colossus, was placed at the Statue of Liberty in 1903. Parts of it read: Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand A mighty woman with a torchFrom her beacon-hand Glows world-wide welcomeI lift my lamp beside the golden door! The message of this sonnet should sound familiar to most of us. The image of the Statue of Liberty blended with the stories of our immigrant past serve as humble reminders of who we are as a country. It's the reason I'm able to stand here before you. Like so many of their generation living in Eastern Europe at the turn of the last century, my grandparents fled the vicious anti-Semitic programs of the czars of Russia to come to America. Widowed at a young age, my grandmother raised her two sons in a tiny apartment atop a grocery store she and my grandfather had opened. With little but her faith, thrift and hope for a better tomorrow, my grandma worked seven days a week to ensure my dad and uncle could realize the promise of this great country. And today, my children and I stand as proof of the possibility to what may have seemed to her like an impossible dream. To uphold this legacy of those whove come before us, Washington will need to make choices. And in a divided government, these choices are often tough. We in the House Majority remain committed to making those tough choices and stand ready to lead with this president. ""Higher""  Milton Wright once shouted from the air. Higher. Making life work for more working people, and all who want to work, is the best way to a future of higher growth and more opportunity.

21047,Deal: Focus on foundations that strengthen Georgia,"Lt. Governor Cagle, Speaker Ralston, President Pro Tem Shafer, Speaker Pro Tem Jones, Members of the General Assembly, Members of the Judiciary, my fellow Georgians: To the Members of the General Assembly, congratulations on your election. To the new members of the House and Senate, welcome! You are now part of one of the greatest and most successful experiments in the history of mankind, the process of self-governance, whereby free people entrust to us the responsibility of preserving their freedoms. We do so if we confine our actions to those things which our constituents cannot do for themselves. Our constitution defines some of the things we shall do, as well as some of the things we shall not do. Between those goal posts of shall and shall not lies the field on which we play. It is not a Field of Dreams but a Field of Law. Like spectators in the stands of a great stadium, a cacophony of voices will tell you what play to run and agree or disagree with your performance. Just remember, we are all on the same team with you, and we share a common purpose of making Georgia the best place to work, play, get an education and raise a family. Last year, I told you that I had a goal: To fulfill the truest purposes of government  the ones for which Georgians need their government most  and then get out of the way so that they can live their lives in freedom and as they see fit. So far, I believe we have done that well. We have made communities safer, improved educational opportunities, provided for infrastructure improvements, driven workforce development, generated a better business environment and created jobs. Together, we have implemented innovative tax reform that incentivizes business growth, passed smart-on-crime criminal justice reform and saved HOPE. This year, I challenge you to join me as we go forward with a focus on progress. While times have been tough and we have had to make difficult choices, I will not lead our state with a Doomsday mindset, reacting erratically and hastily based on fear or ignorance. Instead, we will move forward with confidence, focusing on the proven foundations of a growing Georgia, those that keep us steady during times of uncertainty but also during times of prosperity; foremost among these are public safety, education, healthcare and economic development Just as Georgia is too big and too important to fall prey to Doomsayers pessimism, it is also too big and too important to be divided by race, geography or ideology. This year, lets concentrate on the things on which we can all agree: The foundations that improve the lives of our citizens and undergird the bright horizons of tomorrow. In the first foundation, Public Safety, lets capitalize on the success that we have already had in criminal justice reform, in which, last year, we crafted legislation that saves both lives and taxpayer dollars. Through increased use of accountability courts  drug, DUI, mental health and veteran courts  along with other measures, this state will avoid the need to add 5,000 prison beds over five years and save taxpayers at least $264 million; these measures simultaneously decrease the number of offenders who end up back in jail after being released  and create productive, taxpaying citizens rather than more dangerous criminals. And we have continued funding for accountability courts by allocating $11.6 million toward that purpose in my budget proposal. This year we will continue our work by bringing legislation designed to produce better results with juvenile offenders and divert them from the adult system. I want to thank the Special Council on Criminal Justice Reform for Georgians for their hard work over the past two years. I urge your strong consideration of their recommendations for the Juvenile Justice system. Similar to last year, we would emphasize community-based, non-confinement correctional methods for low-risk offenders as an alternative to regional and state youth centers. To get started, I will be requesting $5 million in the FY 2014 budget to create an incentive funding program that encourages communities to create and utilize these community-based options. These options range from substance abuse treatment to family counseling and provide judges with viable, alternative sentencing options. Just as with last year, we stand to lower recidivism and save taxpayer dollars. For example, are you aware that the cost of each bed in a Youth Detention Center is in excess of $91,000 each year? It is certainly an area where less costly options must be used. Together, we can continue to improve our states justice systems while keeping our citizens safe by reserving our prison beds for violent offenders. This year provides another opportunity to bolster public safety. This past summer, Georgia witnessed several tragic accidents on our waterways. We know alcohol is involved in over 50 percent of all boating fatalities each year. On Georgias roads, if the operator of a vehicle has a Blood Alcohol content of .08 or higher, he can be charged with Driving Under the Influence. However, you cannot be charged with Boating Under the Influence unless your Blood Alcohol level is .10 or higher. The Jake and Griffin Prince BUI Law that I am proposing will change that. If you are too drunk to drive an automobile, you are too drunk to drive a boat! I will also propose, through the Kile Glover Boat Education Law, that you place age limits and educational requirements on young operators of boats and personal watercraft and that children who are 13 or younger must wear life jackets when riding in an open boat that is moving. Another foundation block for growing a more prosperous Georgia is education. Since we are talking about foundations, lets talk about our earliest learners, who build upon what they learn today for the rest of their lives. We have an outstanding pre-K program that has been nationally recognized. This past year, the National Institute for Early Education Research awarded Georgia its first 10 out of 10 in measures of quality; we were one of only five states to receive such a designation. In the budget for FY 2014, I have added 10 days to the pre-K school year, thereby restoring it to a full 180 days and increasing the salaries of deserving teachers. Last year, we focused on literacy by designating $1.6M to establish a reading mentors program that was designed to grow the percentage of Georgias children who are reading on grade level by the third grade. Early indicators are proving it a good investment. We must not let our children fall behind, for that is a path toward remediation and delayed success. As such, I have included $1.6 million in this years budget to continue the reading mentor program. While most state agencies have seen their budgets for the remainder of this fiscal year and for the FY2014 reduced by an average of 3 percent, K-12 education was not subject to these reductions. In fact, the budget will give $156M in additional funding for enrollment growth in K-12 schools in FY2013. For next year, there will be $147 million for enrollment growth and salary increases for teachers based on training and experience. There is also an additional $41 million to fully fund the revised Equalization formulas adopted last year. We must continue to make K-12 education a top priority, because Georgia recently ranked 45th out of the 47 states that reported graduation rates under the cohort method. This is unacceptable! We can do better! We will do better! The people of Georgia spoke loud and clear when they adopted the Constitutional Amendment on Charter Schools by an overwhelming margin. The message they sent was this  They are not satisfied with the status quo! And neither am I! We have been funding public education under the Quality Basic Education legislation, QBE. This is a 1985 formula that does not meet the needs of a 21st century classroom. While adjustments have been made, as recently as last year, more needs to be done. As we finalize the pilot projects and reforms being produced by our Race To The Top initiative, I look forward to modernizing the way we spend tax payer dollars so that we can produce more positive results in our public schools. Public distrust emanates from poor graduation rates, excessive remediation expenses and substandard test scores. Dedicated educators deserve to have this stigma removed. If we dont do that, we will discourage the bright college students who want to be teachers from choosing that profession. We cannot afford that loss! Georgia has had too many school boards placed under the sanctions of potential loss of accreditation. While this is a very serious matter, it is somewhat ironic that the loss of accreditation can only be based on governance issues and not on substandard academic progress of the school system. Unless this is addressed by state legislation, we will continue to have thousands of Georgias children trapped in underperforming schools through no fault of their own. I look forward to working with you to solve this problem. In education, as in most areas of life, poor outcomes are most often not the result of lack of money, but lack of vision and leadership. One of the primary reasons for getting an education is to get a job. To the parents of children who contemplate dropping out of school, you should remind them that they are condemning themselves to the lowest rung on the employment ladder, and you should prepare them to continue to live at home because the jobs that will be available to them will be few indeed. Since employment is a primary goal of education, I want to commend the Chancellor of our University System and the Commissioner of our Technical College System for evaluating and refocusing their programs of study to give priority to those educational paths that have a proven record of employability. It is a tragedy when a young person works hard, accumulates debt for student loans and then graduates with a diploma in a field where there are no jobs. My budget proposes to focus more funds within our HOPE Grant Program toward occupations where we know jobs are available and shortages actually exist. Currently, there are several thousand jobs available for individuals with a commercial drivers license. There are similar shortages in the areas of nursing and early childhood education. In order to fill these vacancies we suggest directing additional funds within our Technical College HOPE Grants so that over 90 percent of the tuition costs in these programs will be provided. Thats Putting Your Money Where The Jobs Are! Two years ago, we worked together to save our HOPE Scholarship program. As a result, it remains one of the most generous state run scholarship programs in the nation. It is also keeping our best and brightest students in Georgia. In FY2011, more than 97 percent of entering in-state freshman at both the University of Georgia and Georgia Tech received the Hope Scholarship. Today, I am happy to say that my budget will increase the Hope Scholarship by 3 percent over last year, bringing the total funds going to Hope in FY 2014 to nearly $600 million. This is quite a contrast to the proposed bankruptcy of HOPE that was projected to occur this year. Thats why I say, together, we saved HOPE! Also, in keeping with our emphasis on results based funding, I would like to thank the Higher Education Funding Commission for its hard work over the past year to provide us with a solid recommendation that will be the starting point for change from enrollment-based funding to outcomes-based funding in our university and technical colleges. I encourage you to join me in fully considering their recommendations. Another foundation block for a growing and prosperous Georgia is healthcare. I want to thank the Commissioner of Agriculture and the Commissioner of the Department of Public Health for their efforts to keep our citizens healthy and thereby minimize the need for expensive healthcare. Commissioner Black has launched the Georgia Grown program in which he is promoting agricultural products grown in our state. He is working with local farmers and school dieticians to increase the consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables by our school children. Commissioner Fitzgerald is one of the individuals leading the Georgia SHAPE program, which is educating and encouraging children regarding the importance of exercise. Both of these efforts will keep young people healthier and will reduce the scourge of obesity that abounds in our state. As a result of a downturned economy and the provisions of federal legislation known as Obamacare, we are seeing a growth in our Medicaid rolls. As you know, I have elected not to expand our eligibility limits for Medicaid. At the State Chamber of Commerce Eggs and Issues Breakfast yesterday, I elaborated upon the reasons for that decision. I did not judge it prudent to expand the eligible population of an entitlement program by adding an additional 620,000 new enrollees since our state is already spending approximately $2.5 billion in state taxpayer funds annually. Even without expanding the eligible population base, we expect our Medicaid rolls to grow by an additional 100,000 individuals. This new population of Medicaid recipients, along with other mandates of Obamacare such as the extension of the time between the review of eligibility, will raise our Medicaid costs by nearly $1.7 billion over the next 10 years. For FY 2014, I am requesting that you authorize the Board of Community Health to apply a provider fee for hospitals, just as they currently do for nursing homes. Unless this is done, there will be a shortfall in revenue to support the Medicaid program of nearly $700M. Since we cannot adjust benefits, the reduction in reimbursements to hospitals would be the only way to keep the program solvent. Those reductions would be approximately 20 percent, which would seriously jeopardize many of our states hospitals. Therefore, I urge your favorable consideration of this legislation. Last year, we appropriated $1.2M to expand residency programs for doctors in our state. I want to thank Dr. Ricardo Azziz, the President of Georgia Regents University Augusta, for leading this effort and the participating hospitals for making it possible for us to develop 400 new residency slots. We believe this is one of the best ways to retain medical doctors in our state. And the FY 2014 budget includes $2M in additional funds to further increase the number of health professionals practicing in the state. The last foundation block for a prosperous Georgia that I will address today is economic development. For the last 2 years during this State of the State Address you have heard me say, The state of our state is strong. That statement is no less true today then it was for each of the two preceding years. In fact, it may be more true now when you consider employment numbers, increased job opportunities, revenue growth and the expanding prestige of our state in the international marketplace. We currently have the lowest unemployment rate we have experienced in nearly 4 years. It is still too high. That is why we must insist that every young person get a high school diploma; otherwise, they become the fuel that stokes the fires of the unemployment furnace. We are continuing to see promising job growth and many of these jobs are paying substantially above the average wage in our state. Since I stood before you last year at this address, we have announced more than 10,000 jobs, and many of these are on the high end of the employment scale. More and more businesses are deciding to make Georgia their home. Some of the reasons for these decisions are government policies of low taxes and reasonable regulations. Together, we are showing the world that we are running state government the way it should be: in an efficient, common sense and businesslike manner. And clearly businesses are taking note of this! We have spent taxpayer dollars wisely. Using 2012 dollars, our per capita spending of government money is 17 percent less that it was a decade ago. And we currently have more than 9,000 fewer state employees than we had five years ago. We have saved taxpayer dollars. The Revenue Shortfall Reserve, better known as the Rainy Day Fund, has been increased by 226 percent since I became Governor. We have reduced the burden on Georgia taxpayers. The Tax Foundation in an article published last month confirms that our state has decreased its state tax collections per capita over the last decade the most of any state in the nation, collecting 25 percent less in real dollars than it did ten years earlier. And last year, with tax reform, you lowered that burden again by increasing the deduction for married couples filing a joint return, bringing the total deduction to $7,400, thus virtually abolishing the so-called marriage tax penalty. There is good reason to believe our job base will continue to grow. Employers like to locate in a state that operates its own affairs in a businesslike manner. But it is not only businesses that pay attention to the fact that we have downsized state government and kept our budget balanced while not raising but actually lowering taxes. Others are watching our state operations, as well, like the three major bond rating agencies that have once again awarded a Triple A rating to Georgia. This comes at a time when some states and the federal government have experienced a downgrade in their ratings. This saves us taxpayer money by reducing the interest rate on our state bonds. The goal I have set for us is to make Georgia the No. 1 place in the country in which to do business. With Commissioner Cummiskey and his superb team at the Department of Economic Development, we are well on our way to achieving our goal. For two years in a row, we have ranked in the top five for business climate by Site Selection Magazine, and we ranked No. 3 for doing business in 2012 by Area Development Magazine. Our state is blessed to have the busiest airport in the world in Atlantas Hartsfield-Jackson airport. This provides us with rapid access to and from about 80 percent of the U.S. population within two hours. It is also one of the reasons certain businesses are coming to our state. Another asset is the Port of Savannah, the fourth largest container port in the country and the second largest on the East Coast. As you know, we have worked for many years to expand the Savannah Harbor and deepen the channel in order to allow the larger vessels that will soon be coming through the Panama Canal to dock in our state. We are very pleased that last fall we succeeded in getting a positive Record of Decision from the federal government. This is a major milestone on this project. My budget includes an additional $50 million in the bond package for this project. This will bring our total state contribution to $231 million. That is almost the states entire contemplated share of the costs of this project; the remainder of the cost is to be paid by the federal government. While that is a sizable amount of money we expect the benefits to be $5.50 for every dollar spentNot a bad return on investment! I will conclude my remarks on a topic that does not require the recitation of statistics, but is one that is recognized in both the public and private domains as a cornerstone of success  that is ethics. We can build the strongest foundations of frugality, efficiency and competitiveness upon which our state government will rest; but if the citizens of Georgia dont trust us, it will all be in vain, for the vibrations of distrust will crack even the strongest foundations. There will always be those in the media and elsewhere who thrive on sowing the seeds of doubt and distrust and who will never recant their sinister innuendos and malicious accusations even when they are vanquished by Truth. And while you will never silence those voices of discord, nor should you try to do so, you can bolster the confidence of the public that might be tempted to listen to them by simply establishing clear rules under which you and those who deal with you in your capacity as elected officials must operate. If there is to be an expansion of the code of ethical conduct for members of the General Assembly, it should apply equally to all elected officials at the state and local levels. We have laid our foundations for a strong and successful Georgiapublic safety, education, healthcare, economic development and ethics. I look forward to working with each of you this session as we continue to grow Georgia in these most crucial areas. And together, we will run a state rather than its citizens lives. May God give you wisdom in your deliberations, and may he continue to bless this great state of Georgia.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2013/jan/29/nathan-deal/deal-rainy-day-fund-blossoming/,Politics,Polifact
21064,Judge grants Measure 11 convict a rare early release,"BURNS -- A blustery Sunday afternoon last November found Circuit Judge William Cramer Jr. catching up on files in the closed Harney County Courthouse. Cramer came to a one-page document, extraordinary for what it would do. The order, awaiting only Cramer's approval, would conditionally release a convict years shy of finishing his mandated sentence. Cramer signed it. With that, he freed Charles L. Clifford and landed in a renewed debate over Measure 11, Oregon's tough crime initiative. The law, passed by voters in 1994, is under new scrutiny as the state prepares to reconsider who should punish criminals: judges or voters. Cramer presided over the 2009 trial that convicted Clifford, now 36, of badly injuring a man in a late-night brawl. The judge sent Clifford to prison for the mandatory 70 months -- nearly six years -- but not before declaring that the sentence was too harsh. The order gave Cramer a chance to release Clifford after he had served the time the judge had in mind at the outset. Measure 11 The law sets mandatory minimum sentences for crimes including murder, kidnapping, robbery and assault. 1994: The year Oregonians passed it, 65% to 35% 6,052: Inmates serving time under the measure 11 as of April 1 17: Of those, inmates under 18 762: Oregonians convicted of Measure 11 crimes in 2009, the year Charles L. Clifford was found guilty 692: Convicted in 2011 14%: Inmates arriving at the Corrections Department with such convictions 46%: Portion of all sentences, in months, handed out in 2011 that were under the measure 15: Age at which those charged under the measure are tried as adults 25 years: The minimum Measure 11 sentence for murder 7 years: The minimum for first-degree robbery or first-degree assault 5 years, 10 months: The minimum for second-degree assault, Cliffords conviction Sources: Oregon Corrections Department, Oregon Criminal Justice Commission Such releases are exceedingly rare. Attorneys involved in Clifford's case could think of only a couple of others in recent years, even with more than 6,000 Oregon inmates serving sentences under Measure 11. Clifford's release is tied to an appeal of his conviction -- and he'll return to prison if he loses. Yet as Gov. John Kitzhaber prepares to assign a new panel to take up sentencing reform, Cramer and the state's other 172 circuit judges could get more discretion in future cases. Kitzhaber is seeking an overhaul of the criminal justice system, including sentencing, to rein in galloping costs. The state spends an average of $30,000 a year to house, feed and care for an inmate -- part of a corrections system that burns through $1 billion in every two-year budget and is projected to cost $600 million more over the next decade if nothing is done. View full size Last year, a commission appointed by Kitzhaber recommended giving judges more power over sentences as part of the answer. But tinkering with Measure 11 is tricky. Voters overwhelmingly approved it. And prosecutors, a potent political power, say the measure has contributed to a drop in crime across Oregon. They argue that sentences have been reasonable and that only the worst felons face the measure's brute force. Defense attorneys vehemently disagree. They say too many defendants are getting prison terms harsher than necessary to protect the public and reform felons. For Cramer, who rejected big city legal work to return to his roots in eastern Oregon, the issue is what is just. ""We cried a lot"" Clifford had only a couple of traffic citations on his record when he landed in trouble. He'd grown up in the Willamette Valley, where he graduated from Woodburn High School before becoming a carpenter. He moved to the tiny community of Crane, about a half-hour east of Burns, in 2006 with the oldest of his two daughters from two relationships. He knew the area from visits to hunt and help friends with spring branding. ""I thought, 'This is a great place to raise kids,'"" Clifford said. He enrolled his daughter in third grade and returned to work as a carpenter. In his spare time, he helped coach youth wrestling teams and volunteered to roof a new community church. Then, in May 2008, he got in a fight outside the El Toreo Mexican Restaurant in Burns just before closing time. A jury convicted him of second-degree assault for breaking the other man's jaw. The verdict came on the last day of school in 2009. Clifford picked up his daughter to take her camping and to break the news. ""We were sitting around the campfire, eating marshmallows. I told her her dad was going away,"" Clifford said. ""We cried a lot."" Neighbors wrote to Cramer to ask for compassion. Clifford was well-liked, they wrote, and a devoted father. They asked Cramer to consider the damage a prison sentence would inflict on Clifford's daughter. Clifford, too, asked for leniency at his sentencing hearing in May 2009. ""I did what I had to do, what I thought at the time in the heat of the moment,"" Clifford said, according to the court transcript. ""And as far as going too far, I stopped when he stopped coming at me. And I don't want to cause harm to anybody, period. But what's done is done."" Cramer won't discuss the still-open case, but the transcript shows he thought Clifford deserved no more than 37 months. ""You would have been eligible in my mind for alternative incarceration programs and things that would have reduced that further,"" the judge said. ""So if anybody wants to know what I would have done if I'd had the discretion to do so, that's what I would have done."" But Measure 11 required a minimum 70-month sentence. ""The voters of this state determined that for certain types of crimes, a one-size-fits-all sentencing,"" Cramer said, acknowledging that many in his courtroom that day probably voted for Measure 11. ""And what it does is serve to take away any discretion that judges have for particular types of crimes. It doesn't allow me to take into account that even if it's a serious injury, some serious injuries are different than other serious injuries."" Clifford was ordered to pay restitution of $62,000 and sent to Snake River Correctional Institution just outside Ontario. His ex-wife took custody of their daughter. ""You're going home"" Then last year, Ingrid MacFarlane, a deputy state public defender, petitioned Cramer to release Clifford as his appeal moved forward. She argued that Cramer did, in fact, have the authority to impose the sentence he wanted. She also argued that Clifford should have been convicted of a lesser crime. Either way, a successful appeal would mean Clifford had already served his time. Cramer agreed. Harney County District Attorney Tim Colahan couldn't dissuade Cramer, and turned to the state Justice Department for help. But it had no better luck getting the Oregon Supreme Court to intervene. Clifford, who had been transferred to minimum-security South Fork Forest Camp outside Tillamook, had been told his chances of getting out early were ""nil."" He got the surprising news when he returned with a work crew. ""You're going home,"" an officer told him. He moved to his mom's home in Canby, married and returned to construction work. He has visits with both daughters. But if he loses his appeal, now pending before the state Supreme Court, he could be back in prison by summer. DA still objects Clifford says that would be a waste. He doesn't see himself as a threat. He also thinks voters should take another look at Measure 11. If voters don't want judges deciding sentences, they could just have minimum-wage clerks push through the paperwork. ""What do we have a judge sitting there for?"" Clifford asked. That's a good question, said Darryl Larson, retired circuit judge and current chairman of the state Criminal Justice Commission. ""Sentencing is a time-honored process that the judge is supposed to do,"" Larson said. ""The judge hears from both the prosecution and the defense. He looks at the facts to whether they merit a particular sentence. Under Measure 11, the judge is pretty much taken out of the equation."" But Colahan, who still objects to Cramer's actions, said Clifford's case didn't call for any discretion. ""I have difficulty in seeing a jury having convicted Mr. Clifford of the offense only to see a court unilaterally reduce that sentence,"" he said. Fellow prosecutors note that 58 percent of those convicted of Measure 11 crimes get consecutive sentences for multiple crimes. ""Judges have used their discretion and, after reviewing the evidence, determined that mandatory minimum is not enough,"" said Wasco County District Attorney Eric Nisley, speaking as president of the Oregon District Attorneys Association. -- Les Zaitz",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/oregon/statements/2013/jan/18/john-kitzhaber/does-oregon-spend-10000-year-student-30000-inmate/,Politics,Polifact
21066,State of the State 2012: Full text of Gov. Christie's speech,"The full text of Gov. Chris Christie's State of the State speech, as prepared for delivery: Lt. Governor Guadagno, Madam Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the 215th Legislature, Members of our Congressional Delegation, Members of the Supreme Court, our former governors and the people of the State of New Jersey: This has been a difficult week for all of us who work in this State House and are committed to public service. Over one week ago, we lost our friend Alex DeCroce. During this week, we have celebrated his life in this chamber, at his wake, at his funeral mass and, undoubtedly in the homes of the thousands of New Jerseyans whose lives he touched during his 23 years of service in the Assembly. We cap that week of recognition today by flying all flags on government buildings across our State at half staff in Alexs honor. Now, if you will all please join me in a moment of silence to honor Alexs life and legacy. Knowing Alex as well as I did over the last 19 years, I know he would tell me, Enough of this now, Chris. Lets get back to work. That is exactly what I intend to do. It is a pleasure to return to this chamber to report to you on the State of our State. Today, I am proud to report that the New Jersey Comeback has begun. How do we know it has begun? Just look around you. In the last two years, we have come together to address the mess that was our budget. The decline, deficits, and departures that plagued our State just two years ago have been reversed. The budget is balanced. Our unemployment rate is no longer going up, it is coming down. Job growth has been restored  in the private sector, where we want it. New Jersey is back. We have restrained the growth of property taxes. We have put our pensions on a more stable and sustainable footing. And in doing all this, we have restored confidence and pride in New Jersey. The New Jersey Comeback is taking place in large part because of what we have done in this chamber. Together, we have done something that Trenton hasnt seen in a very long time. We worked together. We achieved compromise. And we put New Jersey and its people first. For New Jersey, the corner has been turned. Today, the debate is not about who to blame for our failures, it is how to build on our successes. It is no longer about how to deal with devastating decline; it is now about how to push New Jersey even further ahead. To be better than we thought we could be. In these last two years New Jersey has set the standard for governance in America: be honest; dont mince words; and do the big and difficult things. Not only because it is right, but because it lays the foundation for future greatness. Now its our job to finish the task. *** Job one is the economy. Consider where we were just two years ago. When I raised my hand to take the oath of office then, I could not say with confidence that the State would meet its payroll within two months. Imagine that, New Jersey unable to meet its payroll. That was the gravity of the mess we were left to deal with due to the mismanagement which reigned in this town before our arrival. Our deficit for that fiscal year, already more than half over, was more than two billion dollars. The budget problems for the next year, fiscal year 2011, was a record deficit of $11 billion. The solution was not easy, but it was also not complicated. We had spent too much as a state. We had lived beyond our means. And by trying to tax their way out of it, previous governors and legislators had left New Jersey in 50th place  dead last among the states  in the total tax burden it placed on our citizens. We had the highest tax rate in the nation, the highest unemployment rate in a quarter century, and the largest budget deficit per person of any state in the nation. So step one was to stop the bleeding  by stopping the spending. We cut 375 programs in that first fiscal year, saved two billion dollars for the taxpayers, and brought Jon Corzines budget into balance. Next, with your help, we enacted a budget that imposed discipline, in the form of another cut in spending, for the second year in a row: cutting spending for each and every department of state government. That was tough medicine  but it was the beginning of better health. Last year, because we took that medicine, we were strong enough to reduce business taxes and improve New Jerseys climate for job creation. I want to thank this legislature for joining me in recognizing that  for New Jersey to grow private sector jobs again  we must reduce the tax burden on our citizens and our businesses. Step two was controlling property taxes. As everyone in New Jersey already knows, they had risen 70% in the ten years before I became governor. Rising property taxes were driving people out of this state. And so we joined together  and again I thank this legislature and in particular your leaders, Senate President Sweeney and Speaker Oliver  to cap property tax growth at no more than 2% a year. And we put the same 2% cap on the interest arbitration awards that were giving rise to higher taxes. We must never forget that the root cause of rising property taxes is always excessive government spending. As with all problems, you must get to that root cause  and together, we did it. And heres the good news: it is working. Last week, the states largest newspaper announced the results of its comprehensive study of property taxes in New Jersey. The headline said it all: At long last, tax relief. Step three was to get a grip on our long-term liabilities. Our pension system was $54 billion in debt at the start of 2011, and scheduled to be underwater by $180 billion in three short decades without a change in course. It was imperative that we save these pensions for our middle class and at the same time lift the burden off of our taxpayers created by the unrealistic promises made by career politicians. And so we confronted the obvious, negotiated a solution and saved taxpayers over $120 billion dollars. The pensions of every state worker, of every teacher, and of every retired municipal employee are more secure today. By the tough choices we made together, we saved their pensions. Again, the solutions were not easy, and not always popular, but they were also not complicated. We had to raise the retirement age a bit; we had to get a grip on the effect of COLAs; we had to make sure that the contributions of employees were fair, and that the state kicked in also. But by taking these steps we made a big dent in the problem. At the same time, we had a public employee health system that was $67 billion in deficit in January of 2011. To right this wrong, we relied on two simple principles: we should give employees more choice and everyone must pay their fair share. We, once again, compromised with each other to right a failing system and, in the process made political history in New Jersey. We came together. We took on the special interests. We put our citizens first. At the time, the New York Post said we had pulled off something of a miracle in pension reform. But it wasnt magic. In a country dominated in so many places by partisan bickering, we just had to be honest and realistic about the math, and grown-up about the answers. And the good news is this  the people of New Jersey can take it. Weve shown the rest of the country that we are Jersey strong. Today, the results of that Jersey strength and that Jersey attitude are beginning to show. Since our administration came into office, New Jersey has added over 60,000 new private sector jobs. Remember, in 2009, the state lost 117,000 jobs. According to Rutgers University economist Joseph Seneca, 2011 was the best private sector job growth year in New Jersey since 2000. 60,000 new private sector jobs since we took office. The best job growth year in more than 11 years. Here is my promise to the people of New Jersey: We will keep the momentum going. I will not permit anyone to re-impose the tax raising, overspending, irresponsible ways of our past which led to our dark decade of joblessness in New Jersey. Stand strong with me and I will stand up for you. We are going in the right direction and I will oppose any move to return us to the despair those policies brought to New Jersey and its citizens. The new direction is clear. We have changed the business environment in this state and, as a result, we are changing the jobs environment. From Asurion (which established its regional headquarters in Bridgewater), to Allergan (which picked New Jersey for its northeast research and development center), we have been able to attract new jobs from around the country to New Jersey. From Watson Pharmaceuticals (which moved to Parsippany), to Pinnacle Foods (which moved to Cherry Hill), employers are beginning to understand that New Jersey is once again a friendly state for businesses and jobs  a great place to work and raise a family. And its not just around the country. People are recognizing the New Jersey Comeback all around the world Bayer put its North American headquarters in Morris County, Novo Nordisk in Middlesex County, and LG Electronics in Bergen County. We have begun this turnaround in the face of strong national headwinds. Across our country, growth is still anemic. There has been no national solution to our debt and deficit problem, no catalyst for growth, no leadership on the economy. The politics of envy have overtaken the imperative of opportunity. Our economy suffers while Washington politicians  in both parties  fiddle. Americas position of strength and leadership around the world deteriorates while our leaders bicker and blame. Over the last two years New Jersey did the exact opposite. We achieved results because we did it together. Over the last two years weve said  lets put aside our differences on some issues so were able to work together on others. Now it doesnt mean we didnt shout at each other. It doesnt mean we didnt get angry. You may even recall that even some of my friends had some very colorful nicknames for me. Now, that anger is natural, that passion is good, but we have shown that on the important issues, on the really big things, we can still come together to lead the people of New Jersey to a better outcome. Weve shown that its possible to hold fast to key principles, but still reach compromise. Weve shown New Jersey, and the nation that there is a better way. That divided government can work; that Democrats and Republicans working together is possible. And in fact its necessary. Two years ago at my inaugural, I asked Senator Sweeney and Speaker Oliver to join me in a handshake to demonstrate our commitment to working together  sticking to our principles, but finding common ground for the good of the people. Our handshake that day was a symbol, because it could be nothing more than that. Back then, we had nothing to show the people but our good faith and the promise for tomorrow. Today, no symbolic handshake is needed. Thankfully, we have shown through our deeds that we are willing to work together. Substance over form. Accomplishments over partisanship. Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Sheila. So in this year, in 2012, let us continue to show the state and the nation what is possible. Let New Jersey continue to set the example. Let New Jersey continue to lead the way. And let us do it together. *** Over the last two years weve had to make some tough choices. It was important to do what was difficult and what was necessary to get New Jersey out of its hole. But, because of these hard decisions, the shared sacrifice and because we stuck to our discipline we can now focus on our priorities. We will have to continue to hold the line on spending. And I guarantee you this: the budget I submit, and any budget I will ultimately sign into law in June, will be truly balanced. But we have been working to get to this moment. To finally have New Jersey right side up, so we can focus on the big things. To challenge ourselves to be better. To strive for greatness. To ensure that every New Jerseyan is given the opportunity to have the life they want. So in my budget, I will fulfill a promise I made to all the people of New Jersey in 2009. Real relief from the heavy income tax burden that has strangled our families and forced many to move away. I propose to reduce income tax rates for each and every New Jerseyan. In every tax bracket. By 10% across the board. I also propose to fully restore the earned income tax credit for New Jerseys working poor, which we were forced to cut during the dark days of 2010, when growth was gone and we had no money. Understand what this means  every New Jerseyan will get a cut in taxes. The working poor. The struggling middle class. The new college graduates getting their first job. The senior citizens who have already retired. The single mom. The job creators. The parents trying to afford to send their son or daughter to college. Everyone made the sacrifice. Everyone will share in the benefit. This will send a loud signal to New Jerseyans and would-be New Jerseyans, to families here now and families who have left, to businesses and job creators thinking of coming here and those who have struggled to stay: New Jersey is once again a place to plan your future, raise your family, grow your business and someday retire. The New Jersey Comeback has begun. Lets be under no illusions  our job in turning New Jersey around is far from finished. We have improved our tax climate  but, there is much work to be done. For make no mistake  we are in a competition. A competition for jobs  among countries, yes, but also among states. In the last decade, two-thirds of all companies which moved jobs to a new location did not move to other countries  they moved from one state to another. Here in our region, our most direct competitors are making very different choices. In Connecticut, the governor has raised income tax rates on top earners and job creators. And New York last month enacted legislation to do the same. Other big states are also raising taxes. Californias governor has proposed to raise the top rate  already among the highest in the nation, by up to two percentage points. Illinois has already adopted a law to raise all income taxes by 67%. In this environment, the best way to compete is to show a different direction. Let others choose tax increases. We choose responsible tax cuts to give our overburdened citizens real relief. And to help New Jersey grow. Now some will argue, Wait a minute: New York only raised taxes on the rich. Why not adopt Governor Cuomos package for New Jersey? Here are the facts. If we enacted the exact same income tax rates put into law by New York last month, every person earning below $100,000 a year would face a tax increase  of anywhere from 150 to 200%. And, by the way, those earning a million dollars would get a tax cut. Is that what we want? Is that fairness? I dont think so. An across the board tax cut is fair  every New Jersey taxpayer will benefit. Every New Jerseyans rates will go down. Every New Jerseyan will see relief. This is exactly what I was talking about when I took office; that the tough choices would lead to the right ones. Today, because we have put our fiscal house in order we can budget for our priorities and give tax relief to all of our people. Tax relief that will lead to better lives for our citizens and more jobs for our state. Job number two is to reform our education system  to strengthen our schools. Over the course of the last year, since outlining my proposals from this podium, I have worked with this legislature  on a bipartisan basis  to put in front of you a package of bills that will address the biggest challenges facing public education in New Jersey. We have had a year to debate, discuss and deliberate. Now, in 2012, it is time to act. New Jersey, in so many ways, is blessed. The majority of our schoolchildren continue to perform well, above most other states, on national student assessment tests. New Jersey has so many great teachers producing so many great students. Too many in the educational establishment, however, use that very real success as a camouflage for abject failure elsewhere in New Jersey. To use the success of others as an excuse to block change for those we are failing is not only wrong, it is immoral. Too many of our schools are failing our children, and they have been failing for far too long. We live in a time when educational attainment and economic success are correlated as never before. That is a good thing. It means that for this generation of Americans, what you can achieve will be driven not by who you know, but by what you know. You need to look only at the recent Harvard/Columbia study of 2.5 million students over 20 years in America. Its independent research supports what I told you from my heart, from this podium, one year ago. Great teachers have a more significant impact on their students future success than average ones. Even more importantly, average teachers have an even greater effect on their students when they replace underperforming teachers. Research that confirms our own common sense. Tenure reform will lead to even greater student achievement because replacing underperforming teachers with even an average teacher raises each classrooms lifetime earnings by over a quarter of a million dollars. Lets act on real tenure reform now. Lets replace despair with hope in every classroom in New Jersey. Because I believe it is obscene to be satisfied. When the chance for a life filled with hope and opportunity is determined not by how hard you are willing to work but by where you happen to live. Not by your intelligence, but by your zip code. Lets face it: more money does not necessarily lead to a better education. Today, in Newark, we spend $23,000 per student for instruction and services. But only 23% of ninth graders who enter high school this year will receive high school diplomas in four years. Asbury Park is similar: per pupil costs, at almost $30,000 a year, are nearly 75% above the state average. But the dropout rate is almost 10 times the state average. And math S.A.T. scores lag the state average by 180 points. It is time to admit that the Supreme Courts grand experiment with New Jersey children is a failure. 63% of state aid over the years has gone to the Abbott Districts and the schools are still predominantly failing. What weve been doing isnt working for children in failing districts, it is unfair to the other 557 school districts and to our states taxpayers, who spend more per pupil than almost any state in America. Basic human decency and simple common sense say it is time for a different and better approach. The tools to give our children and their parents who are confronted with failing schools the chance for a better outcome are before you. They are embodied in bills which are bipartisan in nature and consistent with the reform advocated by President Obama, Education Secretary Duncan and most recently by New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo. My proposals reflect the input the administration has received at hundreds of meetings with educators, parents and professionals around the state. They are supported by independent research done at Harvard and Columbia. Most importantly, they reflect the intention we should all have: to put children first. The momentum to put children first began last week when you passed, and I traveled to Camden to sign, the Urban Hope Act. This new law will allow school districts in Newark, Camden and Trenton to partner with experts in the private sector to build and operate renaissance schools in these districts so in need of change. We have given some of our urban schools a signal that hope is on the way. I want to thank Senator Donald Norcross and Mayor Dana Redd for their bi-partisan support of this idea. You and I both know that this is a good start, but only a start. There is much more work to do. Here is what I propose:  First, reform tenure  by measuring teacher effectiveness, both with professional observation, and objective, quantifiable measures of student achievement  and then by giving tenure to those with strong evaluations, and taking it away from those whose ratings are unacceptably weak. We cannot ask parents to accept failure in teachers when their childrens lives hang in the balance;  Second, if layoffs are necessary remove the least effective teachers instead of just the most junior ones. It is time to end the system of last in, first out, which protects some of the worst and penalizes some of the best;  Third, pay teachers more when they are assigned to a failing school or to teach a difficult subject. Compensation should be designed to attract and retain effective teachers where we need them most;  Fourth, end forced placements. Teachers should not be assigned to schools without the mutual consent of the teacher and the principal. If an acceptable placement cant be found in 12 months, the school district should have the right to place the teacher on permanent unpaid leave;  Fifth, we should reform our process for authorizing charter schools to attract the best operators to New Jersey, to streamline the process for the best performers, to focus on our failing school districts and to encourage innovation. We must give parents and children in failing schools an alternative; and  Last, and perhaps most importantly, establish tax credits to provide scholarships for low income students in the worst-performing schools in the state to enable them to attend a better school, either out of the district or a private school. Opportunity should not be offered to only those in an excellent school district or with parents who have the money to release their children from the prison that is a failing school. Lets pass the opportunity scholarship act now. These are not radical reforms; they are common sense. They are not rash; they are long overdue. And they are not luxuries which can afford to languish for another six months or another year; they are essential for New Jerseys success. I have a message that is not from me, but from the single mom in Newark, and the struggling parents in Camden, as well as the employers in our state: education reform has waited long enough. *** New Jersey is one of Americas most diverse states. This means we have diverse problems, but also diverse opportunities. It means we must build the skills and improve the opportunities for many types of people, from all backgrounds and all walks of life. And it means we must work in multiple ways to improve the quality of life for everyone. Creating jobs and fixing the schools are probably the two most important ways to do that, but there are other steps we can take as well to improve the quality of life in New Jersey. This leads me to job number three. We need to reclaim our inner cities, respond to underserved regions, and engage our most vulnerable citizens. A few months ago, I hosted a town hall meeting in Union City with Senator Brian Stack. A woman from Newark was there. A mother. A neighbor. A concerned citizen. That day, she asked me a very direct question  and actually, I believe it was a question for all of us. She said, I just wonder if the amount of violence, the amount of shootings, the amount of murders that take place in the City of Newark. I just wonder sometimes if it bothers you like it bothers us. Particularly the mothers who have lost their children. And she ended her question with a plea. Help us, she said, Help us. Well, that woman was Cassandra Dock. And I met with her and her neighbors. She is here in this chamber today. I ask all of you to send a message that in New Jersey we are creating a place where everyone is given the opportunity to live the life they want. I ask all of you to join me in saying to Cassandra. Yes, we will help you. Here is one example: we can only improve our quality of life by keeping the most violent criminals off the streets. So, I ask you to approve my bail reform package, which would mirror the federal system. It would keep offenders with a history of violence who are a danger to our communities in jail until the time of their trial, instead of releasing them into society to prey on the public. This may require a constitutional amendment but it is reform that is long overdue. Do you know that if a person is arrested with a long record of violence we cannot detain that person in jail pending trial? We must release that person, regardless of how dangerous they are to potential witnesses against them or innocent members of our society. Let us amend our bail laws to allow judges to consider the factor of dangerousness to our communities before we release a violent person back on to the street to maim or kill while they await trial. This, too, is just simple common sense. At the same time, let us reclaim the lives of those drug offenders who have not committed a violent crime. By investing time and money in drug treatment  in an in-house, secure facility  rather than putting them in prison. Experience has shown that treating non-violent drug offenders is two-thirds less expensive than housing them in prison. And more importantly  as long as they have not violently victimized society  everyone deserves a second chance, because no life is disposable. I am not satisfied to have this as merely a pilot project; I am calling for a transformation of the way we deal with drug abuse and incarceration in every corner of New Jersey. So today I ask this Legislature and the Chief Justice to join me in this commitment that no life is disposable. I propose mandatory treatment for every non-violent offender with a drug abuse problem in New Jersey, not just a select few. It will send a clear message to those who have fallen victim to the disease of drug abuse  we want to help you, not throw you away. We will require you to get treatment. Your life has value. Every one of Gods creations can be redeemed. Everyone deserves a second chance. *** These are the big things Id like us to focus on in 2012. These are my priorities. We know in our hearts that we represent some of the toughest, the most direct and honest people in America. A group of people who are destined for great things if we just give them the opportunity. But we also know that for too many years these same people were depressed about what New Jersey had become. Our leaders disappointed us in many different ways. Promises were made that werent even attempted to be kept. Our economy suffocated under the wet blanket of overtaxation, overspending, overborrowing and overregulation. Our education systems failed those who needed it the most, and our leaders stood by and said, be patient, and well fix it. In popular culture, New Jersey had become a punch line, rather than a place of pride. Whats happened in the last two years? Over the last two years, New Jersey is now seen around the country once again, not exclusively as the butt of late night jokes, but as a focus of the evening news and the Sunday talk shows. Why? Because, once again, we are leading America  by taking on the big things in public policy. Weve known all along that our State is destined for great things. We just needed to give the people of our State the confidence that can come from watching leaders work together and from a state rising again all around them. To everyone in this room, to everyone watching in their home or listening in their car, I have one simple message: for the New Jersey Comeback to continue and grow, we must all come together. This obligation is not just mine and it is not just Kims. It is not just Steves or Sheilas, not just Toms or Jons. The New Jersey Comeback is not about what happens in Trenton alone. All of you are in this too. Our wins and losses are your wins and losses. Our successes and failures are your successes and failures. The New Jersey Comeback didnt start just here and it wont be sustained just here. The New Jersey Comeback is yours, too. And so I say to all of you, regardless of where you are, regardless of what region of our State you come from, regardless of what political party you call home, you have had a stake in what has happened over the last two years, and you have contributed to making it happen. Now is not the time to stop, now is the time to double down. Now is not the time to put the brakes on New Jerseys growth. Now it is the time to put the foot down harder on the accelerator. Now is not the time to turn back. Now is the time to make New Jersey greatness a reality again. That is what the next two years of my governorship will be dedicated to every day. We have climbed out of the hole that was left to us  together. Now it is time to raise the great flag of the State of New Jersey as high as we can  together. I cannot do it alone. Republicans cannot do it alone. Democrats cannot do it alone. Because, as Martin Luther King once said, We may have come on different ships, but were in the same boat now. We must do this together in every town, every city and every county across our state. If you are ready to join that fight with me in the next two years as you have in the last two years, we will be here two years from now looking at a state that once again is a leader for a rejuvenated America. If you are willing to join that fight, so am I  on your behalf. That is what you elected me to do. And that is the solemn commitment I make to you again today. Thank you, God bless you, God bless America and God bless the great State of New Jersey.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2013/jan/17/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-current-fiscal-year-income-tax/,Politics,Polifact
21068,"Dewhurst, Straus, Perry See Opportunity to Take Up Tax Relief in Session","In a joint appearance Wednesday, the states top leaders offered few specifics about legislative priorities, but Gov. Rick Perry, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and House Speaker Joe Straus seemed to agree that taxes would go down. Dewhurst was the only one who named specifics, saying lawmakers are looking at lowering business and property taxes. But Perry and Straus also suggested that tax relief was on the horizon. I think we have a record proving that tax relief should be a priority,"" Straus said. ""The details of that and the potential for that are yet to be determined."" The three leaders appeared together at a Capitol news conference on the second day of the 140-day session after having breakfast at the Texas Governors Mansion. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. Perry, the longest-serving governor in Texas history by far, said he wanted to hear from Texans about what taxes they want to cut before deciding on a plan. The leaders were far less committal on the level of spending for public education, which was cut by more than $5 billion last session. Asked if the Legislature would restore funding for public education, Perry suggested that the question itself was flawed. He said education spending has been more than adequate over the last decade. Weve had public education funding growing at three times the public education enrollment. So youve had a 70 percent increase of funding from 2002 to 2012. You've had a 23 percent increase in enrollment growth, he said. I think under any scenario over the last decade, the funding that we have seen in the state of Texas for public education has been pretty phenomenal. Im not sure theres any state in the nation thats had that type of [growth], certainly not any big state, Perry continued. Were getting the job done in public education. Straus, who has spoken of the need to build infrastructure for future generations, referred obliquely to unfinished business from last session but didnt commit to any specific level of education funding. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. Dewhurst said that with school finance litigation pending, the discussion was largely academic. Were going to be putting more resources into public education, and there is no reason for us to get into a dialogue back and forth what that number should be because weve got 400, 40 percent of our school districts, have sued us, Dewhurst said. So were going to have a court, one or more courts, tell us what is the right number for us to put in and well fund it.

21147,How to Improve Higher Education: Eight Ideas from the Experts,"Bill Haslam, Governor of Tennessee. One of the biggest challenges states face is producing a workforce qualified to meet the needs of employers in todays economy. In order to increase degree attainment and begin to close the skills gap that exists between workforce supply and industry demand, states should change the way they fund higher education. States have traditionally funded their public institutions of higher education based on enrollments. This means the more students attending an institution, the more money that institution receives from the state. While this may incentivize colleges to expand access, it does nothing to incentivize efficiency and productivity. Institutions are rewarded for admitting more students and keeping them enrolled as long as possible, not for ensuring that every student is making progress toward a degree and ultimately leaving with a credential that has value in the labor market. Instead of funding public colleges and universities based on enrollments, states should use a formula that pays institutions for success in key areas like progress toward and completion of degrees and credentials. Thats what were doing in Tennessee. In 2010, our state adopted a new modelone that funds institutions based on outcomes. While we continue to build on our efforts to raise educational attainment levels in Tennessee and make sure our workforce is prepared for a dynamic economy, other states are following suit and implementing performance-based funding models within their higher education systems. Although Tennessee remains the only state to have a 100 percent outcomes-based model, four other states now determine institutions base funding through an outcomes-centered approach. Several other states either have in place or are transitioning to some type of performance funding. Although some in higher education may oppose tying funding to outcomes, we are already seeing this model changing the way our postsecondary institutions do business, and we know our workforce will be the beneficiary.

21233,Burzichelli Defends Budget Hearing as Christie Continues to Tout Tax Cut,"The Assembly Budget Committee held a hearing today, a day after Standard & Poors lowered New Jerseys credit outlook from stable to negative based partly on lower than anticipated revenue projections. More than a week ago, David Rosen, chief budget officer at the Office of Legislative Services, stated in a memo that tax collections for fiscal 2012 fell $254 million short of Gov. Christies budget forecast. Christie whose tax cut proposal rests largely on projections of a 7.2 percent revenue gain had sharp words for Rosen, dismissing the OLS chiefs new numbers. Rosen appeared at todays hearing but noticeably absent was the state treasurer Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff, who declined an invitation to testify. Democratic assemblyman John Burzichelli (D-3), a member of the budget committee, spoke to NJ Today Managing Editor Mike Schneider from the state house. WATCH VIDEO: With regard to the treasurers absence, Burzichelli said he was somewhat surprised that he did not appear at todays hearing in light of the negative action on the states credit rating. The treasurer could have been helpful today to clarify a few points because the executive branch is speaking to the rating firms as New Jersey goes out to refinance and to float bonds, said Burzichelli. The governor in a radio interview this morning called todays hearing a political show. Burzichelli said he had no problem with the governors remarks, given the context in which they were made. The governors comments were made on a radio program serving a drive time audience and I respect the office of governor, I respect this governor and I respect [that] the governor has a right to say anything he chooses to say. Still, Burzichelli said the budget committee had a legitimate reason for holding the hearing because revenue numbers arent going the way the Christie administration anticipated. If adjustments have to be made in the budget as a result of the shortfall, he said experience tells him they should be made earlier rather than later because a lot of important things have to be funded through this budget that Gov. Christie signed. People who are planning to receive funding, whether it be the Department of Education, Department of Community Affairs, and how all that spreads out, theyre going to find themselves disappointed and that affects plans otherwise made. He also cited factors beyond the states control, saying were subject to a lot of things happening outside of the state, so it was important for the treasurer to be with us. The scheduling of a budget hearing at this time of year is out of the norm. The governor called the timing unprecedented. Burzichelli responded that the fact the governor is continuing to travel around state at town hall forums promoting a tax cut requires an ongoing examination of revenue coming into the state. So as the numbers tell us theyre not materializing as he anticipated they would, the ability to do a tax cut for the higher earners becomes less and less likely and thats why I think we have to have these kinds of hearings now. And we have to be in touch with the information on a more timely basis than a normal course of conduct would allow us to do.

21435,"Response to Mitt Romneys Claim That We Dont Need More Firemen, More Policemen, More Teachers","Response to Mitt Romneys Claim That We Dont Need More Firemen, More Policemen, More Teachers Comments Show Romney Has No Idea Whats Going On With Wisconsins Middle Class Families Democratic National Committee Communications Director Brad Woodhouse and President of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin Mahlon Mitchell held a press call earlier today responding to Mitt Romneys statement that we dont need more firemen, more policemen, more teachers. Listen to the Woodhouse/Mitchell call here. Wisconsinites know that firefighters, police officers, and teachers are the backbone of a successful community, and Romney suggesting they arent vital to our well-being is shocking. These are hard-working Americans who want to make their cities and towns a better place and ensure that every American has a shot at the American Dream and the opportunity to live in a safe, prosperous community. To say anything otherwise is further proof that Mitt Romney is detached from the reality of Wisconsinites. But this comes as no surprise coming from a candidate who has joked about being unemployed himself, said he likes firing people and claimed that corporations are people. Obviously, Romney doesnt get it. Mitt Romney saying we dont benefit from more firefighters, police officers and teachers is further proof of his philosophy of Romney Economics: tax cuts for the wealthy over investments in our community  the same formula that benefitted a few, but crashed our economy and punished the middle class. In Massachusetts, firefighters were among the many victims of Romney Economics. As Romney made clear on Friday, he doesnt care about these jobs  but as governor, he didnt seem to care about their safety either, vetoing millions of dollars for fire-safety equipment and targeting that equipment with a line-item veto. From that earlier call, these remarks prepared for delivery: DNC Communications Director Brad Woodhouse Thank you for joining the call today. As you know, last week Mitt Romney showed just how out of touch he is with middle-class Wisconsinites. In addition to joking that he is unemployed, that he thinks corporations are people too, and telling us that he likes firing people, in a moment of candor Mitt Romney said we dont need more firefighters, policemen, and teachers. These types of statements and this type of sentiment is absolutely shocking. Listening to that, hardworking Americans have to wonder just how much more disconnected from the concerns of middle-class Americans could Mitt Romney be? These are hard-working folks who want to make their cities and towns a better place. To say anything otherwise is further proof that Mitt Romney is detached from the reality of hardworking Wisconsinites and the concerns of their everyday lives. President Obama knows that firefighters, policemen, and teachers are the backbone of a successful community and that they have been hit hard by the recession. On top of creating 4.3 million private sector jobs over the past 27 months, President Obama has given Congress a clear plan that would create as many as one million new jobs and put firefighters, policemen, and teachers back to work. But Republicans in Congress are doing nothing to pass that plan and is leaving a million jobs on the table. President Obama is the only one with a plan to move this country forward and strengthen our economy. Among the first things he did in office, President Obama saved more than 300,000 educators jobs and helped states prevent massive layoffs. And hes making sure they have the resources they need to do their jobs. He supported projects to modernize our childrens schools and smart reforms that give schools and school districts the flexibility they need to best serve students. He also supported hiring programs, provided safety equipment and modernized firehouses and police stations that have helped thousands of police, firefighters and first responders keep their jobs and keep them safe. President Obama understands that when these folks work, it not only helps our children in the classroom and keep our streets safe, but it also gives them more money to spend in their communities at the local shop or corner store. President Obama is working hard to provide solutions. And what is Mitt Romneys solution to strengthen the economy? Fire more people. Even Scott Walker in Wisconsin said that Mitt Romney learned the wrong lessons from Wisconsin in promising he will make cuts to these jobs. Mitt Romney saying that we dont benefit from more firefighters, police officers, and teachers is further proof of his philosophy of Romney Economics: more budget-busting tax cuts for the wealthy and fewer rules for Wall Streetthe same formula that benefitted a few, but crashed our economy and punished the middle class. And this is the same troubling formula that Mitt Romney put in place as governor of Massachusetts where he asked the middle class to continue to sacrifice more. Romney made drastic cuts in funding to education and first responders, and Massachusetts fell to 47th out of 50 in job creation. Middle class Americans cant afford Romney Economics: tax cuts for the wealthy over investments in our community is not the formula for a successful community. Hes promising the same solutions now. Make no mistake, though, the American people and the people of Wisconsin are going to continue to see through Mitt Romneys devastating economic plan. It didnt work in Massachusetts, it wont work in Wisconsin, and it wont work for America. President of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin Mahlon Mitchell Thank you, Brad. Im Mahlon Mitchell, the President of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin, which proudly represents thousands of professional firefighters across Wisconsin and this country. First responders and teachers were among the many victims of Romney Economics in Massachusetts. Romney has made it absolutely crystal clear  he doesnt care about our jobs. And apparently, he doesnt care about Wisconsinites safety, either. In his first year as governor of Massachusetts, Romney slashed investments in local aid, costing about 14,500 Massachusetts teachers, cops, librarians and others their jobs. Romney also vetoed millions of dollars for fire-safety equipment. And it wasnt funding in all-encompassing bill that Romney vetoed. He specifically targeted this safety equipment by vetoing it with a line-item veto. Mitt Romney first cut funding for our coats, pants, helmets and boots  equipment that is essential to do the job and that protects firefighters when they run into a burning building. He went a step further when he cut funding for handheld lights that help firefighters see through the smoke, and the devices that help them communicate with other firefighters. This type of funding wouldve saved more lives by giving firefighters the tools they need to find the victims in a fire, and to track their fellow firefighters to make sure they make it out okay. Even personal-alert safety systems, air packs, tanks and compressors were on Romneys chopping block. Thats the equipment that literally keeps firefighters alive and breathing while theyre surrounded by flames. Firefighters simply cannot do their jobs without that lifesaving equipment. Mitt Romney made it clear that equipment our first responders needed to keep themselves and our communities safe was not a priority to him. And these cuts were so contrary to the values of the Massachusetts people, that both parties in the State House and Senate overrode these vetoes unanimously. But that didnt stop Romney Economics. Governor Romney even had the gall to put a stop to building a fire station that would have been a living memorial for six local firefighters who died in a warehouse fire. This would have been important to both the families and the community, but it wasnt important enough to Mitt Romney. Regardless of what Mitt Romney might think, more cops and firefighters keep our streets safe and our communities protected. Its a fact, and anyone who says otherwise is completely disconnected from reality. The truth is Romney simply didnt advocate for the folks who wouldve risked their lives to save him if his house was on fire  and his comments on Friday prove that nothings changed. I dont know a single person other than Mitt Romney who thinks we have too many teachers, too many police officers and too many firefighters in our communities. Our first responders look out for us in tough times, and its our turn to do the same for them. Mitt Romney just doesnt understand that.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/01/mahlon-mitchell/romney-cut-millions-firefighter-gear-wisconsin-dem/,Politics,Polifact

The father of three supported several bipartisan school reform proposals in his first-term and has been vocal about the need to reform the way schools are funded. Endorsing Lindsay are Hillsboro School Board members Carolyn Ortman, Wayne Clift, and Monte Akers. Shawn understood the need for bipartisan reforms that improve the quality of education for our students, stated Carolyn Ortman. His support for such reforms will improve the quality of education for local students and raise the bar. Lindsay fought in 2011 to ensure schools were funded first. He also sponsored legislation requiring legislators to fund schools within the first 81 days of the legislative session or face losing their paycheck. Shawn Lindsay made funding schools first a top priority, stated Wayne Clift. He backed that up by pushing to ensure the legislature voted on a school budget early giving districts like ours more time to plan our own budgets. Lindsay has long stressed that the legislature cant continue to leave schools waiting in limbo until the end of their legislative sessions every budget cycle not knowing how much classrooms will have for the coming school year. Families across Oregon set priorities and pay for the most important things out of their bank accounts first, not last, noted Lindsay. Yet in Salem they have traditionally waited until the money is almost gone to pay for the most important things in our states budget. While I think classrooms still got shortchanged in the current budget were making progress and thats good, Lindsay said. But we have a long ways to go if we want to change the status quo and direct funds from bureaucracy to the classroom. Lindsay is a strong proponent of education reform, and has voted to eliminate dozens of unfunded state mandates on Oregon schools. He supported establishing the Oregon Education Investment Board to promote strategic, outcome-based budgets for public education, as well as to give school districts more flexibility in managing their own budgets. Lindsay says he will continue to fight for reforms that ensure schools are funded early in the budgeting process, We need to require the legislature to fund schools early in the session so school boards know what they have to work with and can make wise decisions.

21622,"Obama: Supreme Court overturning health care would be ""unprecedented""","Carolyn Kaster UPDATED 3:20p.m. ET (CBS News) -- President Obama expressed confidence Monday the Supreme Court will not overturn his signature health care law when it issues a ruling later this year on the constitutionality of the landmark legislation, arguing it would be ""unprecedented"" for the court to make such a dramatic power play over Congress. ""I am confident that this will be upheld because it should be upheld,"" Mr. Obama told reporters at the White House when asked about the case at press availability after meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Mexican President Felipe Calderon. Mr. Obama said a decision by the nation's top court to throw out the law would be unprecedented and precisely the kind of action that many conservatives for years have criticized as overreaching ""judicial activism."" ""Ultimately I am confident that the Supreme Court will not take what would be an unprecedented, extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress,"" Mr. Obama said in the Rose Garden appearance. The Supreme Court heard three days of oral arguments in the case last week and is expected to issue its decision later this year, possibly at the end of the court's session in June. The president characterized the debate over the law as a ""political"" one, and said most constitutional law scholars believe the law should not be thrown out. ""That is not just my opinion, that is the opinion of a whole lot of constitutional law professors and academics and judges and lawyers who have examined this law even if they are not particularly sympathetic to this particular piece of legislation or my presidency,"" said Mr. Obama, himself a former constitutional law professor at the University of Chicago. ""I would just remind conservative commentators that for years what we have heard is the biggest problem on the bench was judicial activism or a lack of judicial restraint. That an unelected group of people would somehow overturn a duly constituted and passed law. Well, this is a good example and I am pretty confident that this court will recognize that and not take that step,"" he said. On the most controversial aspect of the law, a requirement that everyone purchase health insurance or pay a penalty, Mr. Obama said there is more than just a legal argument to be made. ""I think it's important, I think the American people understand, and I think the justices should understand, that in the absence of an individual mandate, you cannot have a mechanism to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions can actually get healthcare,"" the president said. ""So, there is not only an economic element to this and a legal element to this, but there is a human element to this.

21700,U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island,"Honoring Military Families Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here this evening to express my unwavering support for the men and women who have answered the call of duty in our military services, our Guard and Reserve, and for their family members whose love and steady support for them have carried our servicemembers through challenging times and difficult missions. In honor of Veterans Day, coming up the day after tomorrow, and Military Family Month, which we observe all month long this November, we need to reflect on the enormous contributions military families have made on behalf of all of us. Since September 11, the spouses, children and parents of our service men and women have been faced with huge demands. They have endured repeated deployments, and spent many holidays and birthdays and anniversaries apart from each other. We should do everything we can in our communities to help military families cope with the difficulties and stresses of these multiple deployments. I commend First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden for their commitment to our troops' families and for their work on initiatives to address the unique challenges military families face in this environment. I especially appreciate the First Lady's recent visit to Rhode Island. It provided a warm and welcome boost to military family members in my State, which has the second highest per capita National Guard deployment rate of all the States, as well as a significant active-duty presence at Naval Station Newport. With so many men and women leaving home to serve on multiple deployments, the strain on the family can be particularly difficult. Last month I had the privilege of meeting two extraordinary Rhode Island students, Kathleen Callahan, who goes by Katie, and Kaitlyn Hawley, who presented a powerful and compelling message to school superintendents and educators from across Rhode Island who came together to learn about how they can better respond to the needs of military families. These two impressive young ladies shared their personal stories and described the challenges their families faced while their parents were deployed. The event was part of a collaborative initiative to help military-connected children thrive in school through deployments. I was proud to share in this joint effort with the Rhode Island National Guard, with Governor Chafee, with our Commissioner of Education, the Commanding Officer of Naval Station Newport, our Military Child Education Coalition, and my senior Senator, Jack Reed. Katie is the daughter of a National Guard member. She described how her father's deployment affected the roles in her family. Like most children of deployed servicemembers, Katie assumed additional responsibilities in caring for her younger sibling and helping her mother, whom she referred to as a superwoman. Together, they shouldered the burden of her father's absence and kept the family intact and sound. Katie described the feeling of--to use her words--silent suffering that can occur when military families feel isolated in civilian communities that may not completely understand what it is like when a loved one is deployed. Kaitlyn is the daughter of an active-duty member. She talked about her experience living in eight different States and attending seven different schools. Kaitlyn is a highly motivated student and she explained how she threw herself into her schoolwork during her father's deployment. However, she cautioned that for other students, the opposite can also occur. Some students may have a lot of difficulty focusing on their schoolwork when a parent is deployed half a world away. As Kaitlyn so well put it, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to coping with the stress of deployment. I am proud of Katie and Kaitlyn for their courage, their resilience, and their powerful articulation of a message that I hope everyone hears. We owe our military families an enduring debt of gratitude for everything they have done. We should do everything we can to ensure that no family feels isolated or left out or endures the silent suffering Katie described. I hope every American, as we approach Veterans Day, will actively support our military families, and do what we can to make our communities more welcoming and supportive in accommodating their needs. As Veterans Day approaches, let's celebrate our military families and recognize their extraordinary contributions. Let us thank not only our service men and women but also the spouses, children, and other family members who have shared in the sacrifice of military service. We should also remember the families of our civilian and intelligence servicemembers deployed in danger and away from their families around the world. In concluding, I wish to also express my strong support for the bipartisan legislation the Senate is considering to boost employment opportunities for veterans. Unemployment has been disproportionally high among veterans and we must act now. The last thing our returning service men and women need is to have to face an unemployment line. I urge my colleagues to swiftly pass this much needed legislation, which I am very proud to cosponsor. I yield the floor.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2012/mar/02/sheldon-whitehouse/us-sen-sheldon-whitehouse-says-rhode-island-has-se/,Politics,Polifact
21704,Santiam Correctional Institution: Plan to close prison to save money doesn't add up,"By Ken Allen AFSCME Council 75 represents the workers in the vast majority of the state corrections facilities in Oregon. Our members work hard to protect the public, while working with inmates incarcerated in 13 prisons throughout the state. While the majority of our members are corrections officers, we also represent counselors, dentists, food service workers, nurses, maintenance and clerical workers, among others. These jobs are tough, stressful and sometimes dangerous. The Oregon Legislature and governor are currently considering how to close a $340 million budget hole because tax revenues are less than expected when forecast last May. Part of a budget deal announced on the first day of this year's legislative session would close the Santiam Correctional Institution southeast of Salem. The estimated savings after closure in June would be $1.6 million. The governor and the Legislature should reconsider this plan. The closure plan and the numbers don't add up. The closure is a knee-jerk reaction to a real budget problem. The Santiam Correctional Institution holds 440 inmates. It is a minimum-security facility. Typically, minimum-security facilities are the cheapest to operate, followed by medium-security, with maximum-security facilities at the highest cost per inmate. The legislative plan is to release none of the 440 inmates, but ship them to other prisons throughout Oregon. Under the current plan, 50 percent of these minimum-security inmates would be then imprisoned in a higher-cost medium-security facility. All the 440 inmates would be pushed into an already overcrowded prison system. We have 395 inmates pushed into triple-bunked cells intended for two inmates and bunked in classrooms and areas supposed to be designated for inmate labor. We have units that were designated for 80 inmates with 120 inmates, with only one corrections officer supervising these inmates. We have units with blind spots, including no sightline to the bathroom, with only one corrections officer supervising 80 to 100 inmates. The plan to send 440 more inmates into an overcrowded system would create dangerous and hazardous work for our members and the inmates. Prison overcrowding leads to assaults on staff and other inmates and to lawsuits. The Department of Corrections believes it would have to reopen the facility 12 to 18 months later because of inmate population growth. The leadership of this union is opposed to the closure of the Santiam facility. Department leadership has asked legislators to let them find the $1.6 million of cuts in the budget of the whole department. Legislators should do their jobs to monitor budget needs, but none of them has ever even run a prison. Let the managers and workers at the Department of Corrections put together a plan to save $1.6 million. Don't close the Santiam Correctional Institution.

21741,NHPTV Restructures Due To Elimination Of $2.7 Million State Appropriation,"NHPTV Restructures Due To Elimination Of $2.7 Million State Appropriation Media Contacts:Grace Lessner, New Hampshire Public Television, (603) 868-4328, _EMAIL_ Cookson, USNH, (603) 782-8192, _EMAIL_(Durham  June 1, 2011)  New Hampshire Public Television today enacted a major restructuring plan to offset the impending loss of $2.7 million in state funding, a 30% reduction in its $8.8 million annual operating budget. Under the direction of the University System of New Hampshire Board of Trustees and New Hampshire Public Television Board of Directors, NHPTV is taking the following actions to address the elimination of its state funding: Eliminating 20 full-time positions,  Reducing staff salaries by between 4% - 10% (with management taking the largest reduction), Reducing the stations 403(b) staff retirement plan contribution to 1%, Cancelling dozens of contracts and services, and Reducing the stations Educational Engagement services.In addition to the above measures, NH Outlook and Granite State Challenge, two locally focused programs produced by NHPTV, will be placed on hiatus until additional funding is secured. A small production staff will continue to produce NHPTVs award-winning program Windows to the Wild on a reduced schedule, as well as other grant-funded documentaries and specials. National PBS programs and other viewer favorites will remain part of NHPTVs broadcast schedule. NHPTV will continue to operate from its broadcast center in Durham, NH. For more than 50 years, NHPTV has been New Hampshires only locally owned and operated statewide television network. The station is a licensee of the University System of New Hampshire, which has been responsible for disseminating its state funding. The University System is facing a budget cut of more than 45% in its state appropriation, which is one of the highest proposed cuts nationwide on a system that already ranks 50th in terms of per capita state support. Given these financial constraints, the University System will not be in a position to financially assist NHPTV. NHPTV President and CEO Peter Frid expressed his deep regret and disappointment in having to lay off staff members because of the elimination of state funding. Our employees are talented, dedicated and believe in the mission of public broadcasting, Frid said. The NHPTV board and I thank each of them for their many years of outstanding service. Employees who lose their jobs will receive a severance package and outplacement support.NHPTV Board Chair Mark Collin noted, The Board wants to assure viewers, volunteers, supporters and staff that despite this devastating loss of funding, NHPTV and public broadcasting will be preserved in New Hampshire. Also, NHPTV will continue to seek operational efficiencies. For instance, we anticipate collaborating with other New England public broadcasters to develop a strategic and sustainable model that will allow us all to deliver quality PBS national and local programs throughout the region.

21787,"Senators McEachin, Barker Respond to Gov. McDonnells State of the Commonwealth Address","Great response by Senators McEachin and Barker to Gov. McDonnells budget. The bottom line, according to McEachin and Barker: we are concerned that aspects of the budget Governor McDonnell has put forth will damage Virginia and our economy by cutting hundreds of millions from public education and critical initiatives for children and families. Senators Barker and McEachin expressed Democrats desire to keep doing things the Virginia Way, putting problem-solving above partisan bickering. But both senators expressed grave concern with the deep cuts the Governor is proposing to public education, including cuts to Pre-Kindergarten programs and to cost-to-compete education funding, and with his desire to divert General Fund money, money which funds public education, to pay for transportation projects. (Richmond, VA) Newly-elected Senate Democratic Caucus Chair Donald McEachin (D-Henrico) and Senator George Barker (D-Fairfax) delivered the Democratic response to the State of the Commonwealth Address this evening, calling for both parties to come together to protect funding for our public schools. Senator McEachin: Good evening, Im Senator Donald McEachin, Chair of the Senate Democrats. Senator Barker: And Im Senator George Barker. Were happy to be with you to discuss our future as Virginians. We have challenges. We have opportunities. And, most important of all, we have responsibilities. Governor McDonnell presented some lofty goals tonight. We embrace challenges and will work with the Governor, Republicans in the legislature, and all Virginians to meet many of them. Two years ago we adopted a bold plan to restore Virginias pension system to fiscal health. We are pleased that the Governors proposed budget restores funding as promised, honoring our commitment to teachers and State employees. Over the past decade, under Governors Warner, Kaine, and McDonnell, Virginia has received many accolades: Best State for Business, Best Managed State, Best State for Children. We have achieved such recognition by working together, Democrats and Republicans, in the interest of all Virginians. Although our economy struggled recently, Virginia has done far better than most states, with unemployment well below the national rate. Over the past two years, we have partnered with the Governor and our Republican colleagues to help create more jobs in Virginia. We worked with Governor McDonnell to increase funding and improve targeting of money to bring businesses and investment to Virginia. We have put your interests and problem-solving before partisan bickering. Over the last several years we cut 6 billion dollars and balanced the budget without raising taxes. We also did it without decimating support for education, public safety, and services for children, the elderly, and those with disabilities. We look forward to working with the governor to pass a budget that is best for all Virginians. But we are concerned that aspects of the budget Governor McDonnell has put forth will damage Virginia and our economy by cutting hundreds of millions from public education and critical initiatives for children and families. Rather than making such cuts, we should be meeting our legal and moral responsibilities to our children and families. In the past Virginia has met many needs with limited state funds by partnering with local non-profit agencies. However, the Governors budget would eliminate funding for teen pregnancy prevention programs and centers protecting victims of child abuse, and slash support for free clinics and community health centers, among others. We and our children need these programs. Particularly short-sighted are cuts to pre-Kindergarten programs that put disadvantaged children on a path to success. These programs serve children who need to catch up to their peers before starting kindergarten. Studies have shown that children who come to kindergarten well-prepared are more likely to graduate high school, have higher earnings, and are less likely to be arrested. We all have an interest in continuing Virginias tradition of investing in our children. The governor is also short-changing our kids by proposing to eliminate so called cost-to-compete money for our local school districts. This fund allows our localities to keep the best and the brightest school personnel here in Virginia, instead of losing them to higher paying states. This amounts to a nearly 65 million dollar cut to Northern Virginia schools alone. And now Id like to re-introduce Senator Donald McEachin. Senator McEachin: Overall in this, his first budget, the governor is cutting Pre-K and K through 12 public education by hundreds of millions of dollars. His proposal to take more sales tax revenue to fund transportation is perhaps where we have our strongest disagreement. Governor McDonnells program would take 110 million dollars out of the General Fund, which is money that pays for our schools. And taking money from education is a terrible approach to transportation funding. The governor needs to work on a real long-term solution to funding transportation instead of treating public education as a piggy bank to be raided. Taking money out of our classrooms to pave roads doesnt help build Virginias future. It doesnt help our children and it doesnt solve our transportation problem. We also oppose another Republican pet project, giving big corporations tax breaks for donations to private schools. We need to educate all of our children, not just the select few who can afford private schools. We strongly believe taxpayer dollars should be used for public education, not for rich private academies. Weakening our public schools will not only hurt our childrens ability to compete in a cut-throat global economy, but also will make our state a less attractive place to do business. Last year, as in several years past, Virginia was named the Best State for Business. We earned that title for a variety of reasons, including education, a category in which received one of the highest ratings. Businesses will choose to come here if they know their employees families will be happy and their children will get a good education. We want to be a first choice for businesses so we can offer good-paying and numerous jobs. This past November the voters of the Commonwealth elected 20 Democrats and 20 Republicans to the Senate, so to pass a budget we need to work together. We will work with the governor and with senators and delegates of both parties toward putting Virginia on the right track to economic growth, but we will not agree to short-changing our children and our future. Short-term band-aids are not a real solution to problems. Public education, transportation, a well-run and efficient state government-these are important priorities and all of them will determine whether Virginia is a state that leads the country with a robust economy in the next decade, or whether we fall behind. We have obligations to future generations, and I hope we can all keep that in mind this session. So I say tonight to the governor and his party, we share many of the same goals; lets work together to make progress this session. That is what the people of this great commonwealth voted for and thats what they deserve. Thank you, and God bless the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2012/jan/26/donald-mceachin/mceachin-says-gov-mcdonnells-budget-cuts-public-ed/,Politics,Polifact

22066,The First Order of Business,"The First Order of Business Remarks by Mike McCabe at the 10th Annual Fighting Bob Fest Posted: September 19, 2011 Updated: September 20, 2011 These are weird times. Its not every year a state Supreme Court justices throat makes its way into another justices hands. And its not every year you see 100,000 people protesting on the Capitol Square. Or nine recall elections in one summer. WDC Executive Director Mike McCabes Remarks On The Earth Productions Video courtesy of A symbol of the weirdness thats burned into memory: The inflatable palm trees demonstrators were carrying during the height of the mass protests to poke fun at the Fox News coverage. How weird is it that a national news network showed its audience footage of protesters resorting to violence in Wisconsin and there were palm trees swaying in the background? How weird is it that when millions of Americans are looking for real news and some honest-to-goodness truth telling about whats going on in the country, they tune in to Comedy Central? Now I read in the newspaper that there are rural towns in Wisconsin that are tearing up their paved roads and putting down gravel instead. I grew up on a farm on a dirt road in Clark County , and we always saw paved roads as a sign of progress. Now were going backward. That wouldnt be so weird if state money for road construction had been cut by 15%. But theres a 15% increase in the state budget for road building. Those in charge at the Capitol just dont want the local town road crews to have any of it. They want it all to go to the private contractors who make all the campaign donations. These are weird times. I dont want you to take this the wrong way. And I sure dont want my wife to take this the wrong way. But I was lying in bed last night thinking about Tommy Thompson. How weird is that? Here youve got a guy who became Republican leader in the Assembly some time shortly after his birth, and went on to become a four-term Republican governor. Yet now the Club for Growth says Mr. Republican cant belong to the club anymore. Hes not conservative enough. Not extreme enough. Theyre running ads saying Thompsons not a real right-winger. So Mr. Republican has to respond by saying thats a malicious lie and insisting that he really is enough of a wacko to belong to the club. These are weird times. Amid the weirdness, its important to remember this. We gather here today on the 100th anniversary of the most amazing legislative session in Wisconsin history. Maybe the greatest in American history. In that 1911 session, the Wisconsin legislature created the nations first workers compensation system. Sweeping railroad regulations were enacted. Insurance industry reform and the establishment of a state life insurance plan. The first progressive income tax. Vocational and technical education systems were started. Historic blows for worker rights, as maximum work hours for women and children were set. What happened in 1911 was no accident. It happened because of what was done years earlier. In 1897, bribery, illegal voting and election fraud were outlawed. In 1905 donations and election spending by corporations were banned. These actions were the foundation upon which the 1911 session of the legislature was built. Think about it. Wisconsin became a state in 1848. Bribery was outlawed in 1897. Bribing a public official was perfectly legal for the first half century of statehood. Then it was criminalized. Now its legal again. The bribes are now called campaign contributions and independent expenditures and issue ads. There used to be poll taxes and later they were outlawed. Now theyve brought them back, masquerading as a requirement that voters have a photo ID in order to cast a ballot. Criminal rackets have long required the payment of protection money. How is what wealthy interests are doing in the political arena any different? Just look at whats happening to wind power projects in Wisconsin . Oil and gas interests invested vast sums in the election of Scott Walker. The Koch brothers alone spent more than $1 million to put him in office. Real estate and construction interests, also lobbying to block wind energy development, put $1.2 million behind Walker s campaign. Since becoming governor, Walker has deep-sixed close to a dozen wind energy development projects. Ask anyone in this room . . . hell, ask anyone in the state if they think its a good idea for America to become more independent of foreign oil. Ask anyone if they think developing alternative energy sources makes sense. Youll almost universally get a resounding yes for an answer. Yet Wisconsin is erecting all kinds of barriers to wind energy development. Why? Because those who want to keep us addicted to oil paid protection money. Road builders made Scott Walker the number one recipient of their campaign contributions. They wanted $800 million in federal rail funds to go to crumbling roads instead. Walker and his allies threw away the $800 million. Other states got our money. Why? Because interests who want to keep us in cars paid protection money. Yet were seeing a return to dirt roads in rural areas of our state as rural towns rip up their pavement and put down gravel instead. Why? Because the private road contractors paid protection money and got the state to send all the construction money to them, not the local townships road repair crews. Call it vending machine politics. Toll booth democracy. Some call it a fancy word  plutocracy  that hardly anyone knows. Some want to use the F word even though its fruitless because next to no one distinguishes between early-onset fascism and the late-stage form that involves gas chambers and that kind of thing. Call it what it is . . . a criminal enterprise. It is a crime that the richest 1% of Americans have more wealth than bottom 95% combined and that the 400 richest have a bigger net worth than half of all Americans collectively. And it is a crime that the top 1% has been able to buy tax and economic policies that have led to such injustice. It is a crime that $800 million for rail development was thrown away and rural communities are returning to dirt roads, all to keep the private road builders happy. It is a crime that public officials keep saying yes to the old economies of oil and gas and asphalt and concrete and no to new economies like green energy. It is a crime that Wisconsin has seen the biggest cuts in education in the nation. It is a crime that no public health insurance option was debated much less voted on in Congress. It is a crime that Wall Street has proven too big to jail. It is a crime that we have pay-per-view congressmen who make people pay to attend a town hall meeting. There is a criminal syndicate behind most all criminal enterprises. Modern day politics is no different. To control what people read, see and hear, those in power created their own media organizations to spread their propaganda. Big ones like Fox News. Small ones like Wisconsin Reporter. To control elections, they turned them into auctions, effectively taking the r out of free speech and making sure front groups of their making do most all of the talking. They brought back poll taxes. Once the elections are over and attention turns to lawmaking, they have their bill mills like the American Legislative Exchange Council, better known as ALEC, to draft model legislation that is pedaled to state lawmakers across the country. And to defend the laws they write against legal challenge, theyve stacked the courts. What used to be the third branch of government is now an extension of the other two. What used to be a check on the power of the executive and legislative branches is now a rubber stamp. Look no further for evidence than the assault on worker rights in Wisconsin . When a lower-court judge ruled that the law abolishing most collective bargaining rights was illegally passed because the Legislature failed to follow the open meetings law, a state Supreme Court justice ruled that the judge was wrong to rely on laws that apply to the Legislature except when the Legislature says they do not. They built this juggernaut with boatloads of money, of course. But they also had a carefully conceived plot and a gift for public relations. Have you ever noticed that whatever they plan to do they accuse their opponents of doing first? When they set out to create a vast propaganda network masquerading as legitimate news organizations, they first spent years screaming MEDIA BIAS! When they wanted to bring back poll taxes and otherwise rig elections, they first incessantly squealed VOTER FRAUD! Before launching a three-decade long class war, systematically dismantling progressive taxation and cementing in place economic policies that led to massive transfers of wealth from the poor and middle class to our societys most affluent, they met every plea for social and economic justice with the screeching condemnation CLASS WARFARE! When they plotted to legislate from the bench and reinterpret the First Amendment to remove the r from free speech, they first shouted JUDICIAL ACTIVISM! umpteen times and branded moderate and liberal judges alike judicial activists. All I can say is that if they ever start accusing their opponents of backing socialized castration, watch your flies men! This is going to sound funny, but to combat this madness the first order of business cant be tax or economic policy, it cant be holding Wall Street to account, it cant be health care, it cant be education, it cant be climate change or clean air & water. You cant tackle the jobs problem, the budget problem, the tax problemwithout tackling the first problem  money in politics. It is corrupt. It is institutionally corrupt. I am not the first person to say this. Would you believe that I am quoting a Republican presidential candidate? A current GOP candidate? Our state and our country have been run off the rails. If we are to get back on track, the first order of business needs to be recriminalizing bribery. Doing away with the new poll tax. Restoring our democracy. To set the stage for this years Fighting Bob Fest, Ed Garvey asked Bob Festers if it is time to start a third party. I know if Jim Hightower were here right now, he would crack wise and say that hed settle for two. Im holding out for one thats worth a damn. If there is to be any party building movement, it needs to focus on creating a first party, not a third. We need at least one party that isnt hopelessly beholden to the less than 1% of the population that makes all the campaign contributions but rather works for the other 99% of us. And you all have to come to terms with the fact that the Republicans couldnt have done what they did in Wisconsin this year unless Democrats did what they did a year ago or two or 10. The Republican Party would not have become what it has without Democrats becoming what they are. When wackos are in charge, the last thing on earth that is needed is a bunch of weenies as the alternative. As was the case in late 1800s and early 1900s  in Fighting Bobs time  the question is not which shall rule, Democrats or Republicans? Its which shall rule, wealth or people? If you are a high school student, I have one word of advice for you. If you are a little older, I have one word of advice to share with your children and grandchildren. The future of our state and our nation depend on it. Pharmaceuticals. We need some smart young person to invent a miracle pill  a sort of Viagra for the spine. And we need to persuade progressive politicians to take it. Then if you see politicians with stiff spines and erect posture lasting more than 4 hours, you need to call the Capitol switchboard at once and tell them to take more pills. Until those magic pills kick in, I leave you with this thought. Only a crisis  actual or perceived  produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That, I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes politically inevitable. These are not normal times. Things are so freaking messed up Im lying in bed thinking about Tommy Thompson and quoting Milton Friedman. But this much I am sure of . . . . If the right ideas are going to be lying around when the politically impossible becomes politically inevitable, you and I cannot be lying around now. This no time for moping. No time for despair. No time for throwing our hands into the air. This is a time to hope and a time to dream. This is a time to listen and learn. A time to think and teach. To plot and plan. To speak and tweet and network. To organize and boycott. And march. And vote. If we do these things, the history we are celebrating today will repeat itself.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/oct/02/mike-mccabe/campaign-money-critic-mike-mccabe-says-cash-strapp/,Politics,Polifact
22079,Rick Perry to Newsmax: I Regret 'Heartless' Comment on Immigration,"Presidential candidate Rick Perry on Wednesday apologized for saying that anyone who opposed giving tuition breaks to the children of illegal immigrants did not have a heart.In an exclusive interview with Newsmax.TV, the Texas governor said he had made a poor choice of words during the Sept. 22 presidential debate, but he stood by his view that the decision in his state to extend tuition breaks was the right one.I was probably a bit over-passionate by using that word and it was inappropriate, Perry admitted. In Texas in 2001 we had 181 members of the legislature  only four voted against this piece of legislation  because it wasnt about immigration it was about education.During the wide-ranging interview, Perry: Opposed the idea of a fence stretching the entire length of the Mexican border; Repeated his claim that social security is a Ponzi scheme, saying its so bad it would make Bernie Madoff blush; Attacked challenger Mitt Romney as a flip-flopper; Accused President Barack Obama of sending government agencies to go to war against business, and; Said most voters want their president to be a person of faith.Perry said a fence stretching the entire length of the Mexican border would be expensive, ineffective and would trample on property rights.However he wants what he calls strategic fences in urban areas combined with more border agents and eye-in-the-sky planes to beam down real-time information on suspect activity.In the metropolitan areas where the fencing actually can play a positive role, absolutely, he said. But you have to have boots on the ground.I cannot overstress how important it is to have that law enforcement presence that can immediately move to an area where you are seeing activity because you have got the aviation assets in the air, thats how you secure the border.But having an obstacle without observation is no obstacle at all. So just the idea of building a fence and saying, That will take care of it, lets just build a fence, has never worked in the history of mankind.Perry said that his decade-long tenure in the Governors Mansion in Austin has given him a unique perspective on the immigration issue. Nobody has dealt with this issue more than I have, he said.As Texas governor, a border governor, you have to deal with these issue, you cant just talk about them and say, Oh, lets build a wall from Brownsville to El Paso and that will take care of it. We have to live with reality.But he said the biggest immigration issue is the failure of the federal government to uphold its constitutional duty to secure the border.We wouldnt be having these conversations today, whether its about in-state tuition for illegal immigrants or whether its the Arizona law or whether its voter-ID which we passed in Texas, or sanctuary cities and the banning of those None of those would come up if the federal government had simply done its job through the years to secure our borders.Perry is leading the race for the Republican nomination for the presidency in the opinion polls despite perceived poor performances in a series of debates. He again took the opportunity to attack his nearest challenger, Mitt Romney for flip-flopping on the issue of healthcare. Perry said that President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law was patterned on the bill Romney signed into law when he was governor of Massachusetts.In his book, he said  I want to do what I did for Massachusetts for the rest of the country, said Perry. He took that line out of his paperback thats in publication today, so again, another one of those flip-flops from the governor of Massachusetts.When he finds that something he believes in strongly is not acceptable in the political arena in todays presidential race, he tries to change his tune.He said a repeal of Obamacare is the highest calling for whoever is the next president, although he hoped that the Supreme Court will have ruled it unconstitutional well before the next inauguration. He said the incoming administration should then transition into a program where the states play a substantially greater role, where Medicaid is block-granted back to the states and they have the ability to come up with various innovative ways with menus of ideas of how to deliver healthcare to the people of their states.Thats the way to not only get the budgetary side of this under control but actually to deliver healthcare to more people in more thoughtful and more innovative ways.On social security, Perry said that seniors and those nearing retirement have nothing to worry about. The program that has historically been in place will be in place for them, he said.He attacked members of both parties for trying to scare seniors by saying they would lose their social security payments. That is very immature from my perspective, he said.Americans want answers, they want straight-speaking, truth-telling individuals working for them and thats what Ive done.Kids know, 25-36 year-olds, they know that social security, if they keep paying into the program that weve got today, it would make Bernie Madoff blush. This is a Ponzi scheme for them.He said possible solutions include allowing people to take their accounts and put their money in the market, staggering the age upward for when people can collect and giving states more say.The states could play a more active role in dealing with social security for their state employees and/or their retirees  obviously not for the general population, he said. ""In my book I talked about three counties in Texas that had taken advantage of opting out of social security and today Brazoria, Matagorda and Galveston counties all see substantially higher payments to their retirees than had they stayed in the social security program.""Perry attacked the Obama administration for the explosion in regulations that he said were hurting the economy.I really believe in the free market and one of the problems that weve got in this country is government sticking their nose into way too many areas that frankly the private sector will work its way through and the marketplace will work its way through.There is agency after agency in Washington D.C that have basically been loosed to go to war against job creators in this country and that is one of the things, as president, that I will do. We will pull back all these regulations and rein in these agencies that are running looseherd over the private citizens and the job creators in this country.On energy, Perry accused Obama of trying to make America look like Europe with high gas prices caused by a failure to develop our own resources.This administration does have an energy policy, he said. It is to make our country more dependent upon foreign sources of oil. That is bad for America economically, its bad for America strategically.That is his plan for energy prices to skyrocket so that America looks more like Europe. I dont want America to look more like Europe.Perry, who has led much-attended prayer rallies in Texas, also talked quite openly about his faith during the interview. He was asked about comments made by the Rev. Franklin Graham, who told Newsmax in one exclusive interview that he believes Obama discriminates against Christians while showing undue favoritism toward Muslims.Graham was banned last year by the Obama administration from a Pentagon prayer gathering for the National Day of Prayer.Perry, who hosted a highly controversial prayer rally called The Response shortly before jumping into the presidential race, said that Americans overwhelmingly want a religious presence in the White House.The president of the United States should be a person of faith and not be afraid to stand up and talk about the values that they believe in their heart, he said.Those Judeo-Christian values that this country was based upon are still very important to the vast majority of the people of this country. They want to see those exhibited both in word and in deed.Perry also attacked the administrations foreign policy as muddled, saying the United States should always stand by its allies, especially Israel. Israels not perfect but they are a friend and we should send message after message that if you attack Israel, you attack America.Our allies dont know whether were going to be standing with them or not, he added, mentioning the decision not to sell the newest weaponry to Taiwan and India for fear of offending China and Pakistan.We need to clearly send a message, were going to be there for our allies in those regions of the world. India had to go to France to buy the fighters that they needed  bad message.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2011/sep/28/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-only-four-texas-lawmakers-opposed-/,Politics,Polifact
22121,About George Allen  GeorgeAllen.com,"Family. Faith. Freedom. Football. The Four Fs have shaped George Allens entire life. The son of an NFL coach, George Allen learned early on it was family that would always serve as the one constant in a life filled with ups and downs, hirings and firings, and moving. These days, he sees husband and father as his most rewarding titles. Hes been married to Susan for twenty-five years. Together they have raised their three children  Tyler, Forrest, and Brooke  sending them to public schools while living all over Virginia in the Charlottesville area, Richmond, Chesterfield, and currently in Mount Vernon. Like other parents, they are watching them learn in middle school, head off to college or even enter the world with a degree ready to tackle the exciting challenges ahead. George grew up in a football family with grace before supper and seeing the concept and importance of faith instilled in all the teams his father coached. From having the Redskins chaplain, Tom Skinner, provide the invocation when he was sworn in as the Commonwealth of Virginias 67th Governor to continuing to work with local pastors as they serve their communities, George has not lost sight of those guiding principles he learned growing up. George Allen is fond of telling how the two greatest influences in his life were his parents. His mother grew up in Tunisia where she experienced the oppressive and terrifying Axis occupation during WWII. It was from his mother that he learned the concept and blessings of Freedom. Its a concept that would shape his life and help instruct his political philosophy and beliefs. George started his professional career as a law clerk in Southwest Virginia for beloved conservative Judge Glen M. Williams. The lessons he learned from Judge Williams and the time he spent in Abingdon continue to impact his appreciation for the rule of law to this day. A self-described Common Sense Jeffersonian Conservative, George had the distinction of holding Thomas Jeffersons seat in the Virginia General Assembly. As Governor he put into practice many of the ideas and concepts that he worked on while serving in Mr. Jeffersons seat. Sworn in as Governor in 1994, George set about to bring sweeping reform that would make Virginia a national model in economic development, public safety, education accountability, welfare reform, and creative government. He challenged critics and sentiment that suggested it couldnt be done, reining in government spending and substantially reducing the size of the state workforce. And he accomplished his reform agenda with bi-partisan support. Elected to the U.S. Senate in 2000, George continued to advocate for Virginias families. He advocated for the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts that spurred opportunities for more job creation and created the Competitive Caucus to keep America the world capital of innovation. George was one of about a dozen Senators to vote against the Bridge to Nowhere. He strove to make Congress live like families do  within its means  by introducing and advocating for real budget reform including a balanced budget amendment, line item veto, and a paycheck penalty for Members of Congress when they fail to pass appropriations bills on time. Since leaving the U.S. Senate George has continued to advocate for the issues and ideas he has always fought for. He launched the American Energy Freedom Center, whose mission is to advocate positive ideas for American jobs, economic prosperity and promote increased freedom, opportunity, and competition in the development and use of our vast energy resources. George also serves as the Reagan Ranch Presidential Scholar for the Young Americas Foundation. Ronald Reagan  one of Georges other political influences  can be credited for getting George involved in politics when Governor Reagan asked him to lead Young Virginians for Reagan in 1976. Football has always been a central part of George Allens life. And he lived it watching his father coach growing up. He played it at the University of Virginia where he holds a degree with distinction in History, as well as a law degree. George firmly believes sports is a meritocracy that rewards earned success, teamwork, preparation, competitiveness, perseverance, innovative leadership and hard work  and shows how our government ought to live by some of these principles and characteristics. In his recently released book, What Washington Can Learn from the World of Sports, he presents solutions that can work to put people across America in a position to compete and succeed in achieving their dreams.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2011/sep/12/george-allen/allen-says-he-reined-state-spending-governor/,Politics,Polifact
22186,Cut Cap and Balance Act,"Despite our nations staggering $14.4 trillion debt, there are many Members of the U.S. House and Senate who want to raise our nations debt limit without making permanent reforms in our fiscal policies. We believe that this is a fiscally irresponsible position that would place America on the Road to Ruin. At the same time, we believe that the current debate over raising the debt limit provides a historic opportunity to focus public attention, and then public policy, on a path to a balanced budget and paying down our debt. We believe that the Cut, Cap, Balance plan for substantial spending cuts in FY 2012, a statutory spending cap, and Congressional passage of a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution is the minimum necessary precondition to raising the debt limit. The ultimate goal is to get us back to a point where increases in the debt limit are no longer necessary. If you agree, take the Cut, Cap, Balance Pledge! There are versions for elected officials, federal candidates and ordinary citizens. Thanks to Pop Minute TV and our other media partners for the coverage. THE PLEDGE I pledge to urge my Senators and Member of the House of Representatives to oppose any debt limit increase unless all three of the following conditions have been met: Cut - Substantial cuts in spending that will reduce the deficit next year and thereafter. Cap - Enforceable spending caps that will put federal spending on a path to a balanced budget.

22279,First-term Assembly Republicans drove history-making changes,"The bumper crop of new Assembly Republicans - 27 of the 59 Assembly Republicans are serving their first terms - played a decisive role in the history made in the Capitol over the past six months. On March 10, they provided 24 of the 53 Assembly votes for first-term Republican Gov. Scott Walker's bill that all but eliminated collective bargaining for most public employees and weakened their unions. Despite massive Capitol protests, threats and needing State Patrol escorts out of the Capitol, first-term Assembly Republicans did not waver in their support for Walker's changes. They also all voted for Walker's 2011-'13 budget, which cut aid to public schools, local governments, the University of Wisconsin System and technical colleges and took tax-credit money from poor single parents. Democrats say those votes will cost many of the new Republicans their jobs in November 2012 elections. There's a saying in the Capitol: First-term lawmakers are most vulnerable. If they aren't beaten when they seek a second term, the odds are they will be in office a long time. That's why past first-term lawmakers who have been protested, forced to take difficult votes that angered special-interest groups and who get ""you're a one-termer"" taunts, have often nervously searched for face-saving compromises and tiptoed away from their campaign promises. That wasn't true for these first-term Assembly Republicans. They adopted a different response: ""Bring it on."" ""I signed up for exactly this,"" Republican Rep. Michelle Litjens, of Oshkosh, said in a WisconsinEye interview last week. ""I wanted to fundamentally change government in the state of Wisconsin."" ""We all expected we were coming into something really, really rough,"" added GOP Rep. Roger Rivard, of Rice Lake, whose district had been represented by a Democrat for 26 years. ""I knew it was going to be rough, because - apparently - we went down this (spending) road for many, many years and they didn't have the courage to do it,"" Rivard added. Who are these 27 first-term Republicans? They are overwhelmingly male (only three of the 27 are female). Their average age is 44; two of them are in their 20s, and nine are in their 50s or older. Their pre-Assembly jobs vary widely, although many have a small-business background. They include four certified public accountants, a physician, a veterinarian, a dairy farmer and a founding member of an oldies-style music and entertainment group. Although Democratic lawmakers often work in government - and often in the Capitol - before being elected to the Legislature, that is true of only one first-term Assembly Republican. The leader of Assembly Republicans, Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald, said the toughness displayed by first-term Assembly Republicans was a big reason his caucus stayed united. ""You had freshmen standing up that are in swing districts that said, 'You know what? I didn't come down here to be re-elected again. I came down here to set the state right, and that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to take this vote; I know it's probably not the easiest politically for me,' "" Fitzgerald said, adding: ""That was the beauty - the political courage - of it, that these folks were like, 'I'll take this vote and, if I don't come back, I can look myself in the mirror and say, 'That's what I went down there to do and that's what I think the people sent me there to do.' "" But Assembly Democratic Leader Peter Barca said some of those Republicans took votes that will cost them their jobs. ""Freshman Republicans have been unexpectedly very quiet this session,"" Barca said in a statement. ""Their role appears to be largely following their legislative leadership as they all rubber-stamp Gov. Walker's agenda."" ""Given that many of them ran as being independent and vowing to shake things up at the Capitol to their tea party base, it is a surprise"" that they stayed united, Barca said. ""They voted in lock step"" with Republican Party leaders. Barca also said first-term Republicans ""voted to take funding away from their public schools in their districts to give it to private Milwaukee voucher schools"" and passed a budget that raided specific funds and raised taxes and fees, despite their campaign promises. Privately, Assembly Democrats say their top target next year is Republican Rep. Joe Knilans, who won the Assembly seat from look-for-the-union-label Janesville.

22625,"MPS could face $13.6 million shortfall, benefit rate still high","It's early in the budget season for Milwaukee Public Schools, but the administration said in a presentation Thursday that it could face a $13.6 million budget shortfall next year. Figures are preliminary because it's unclear what the state's budget will include for schools. But Chief Financial Officer Gerald Pace told a Milwaukee Board of School Directors' budget committee Thursday night that the end of the federal stimulus was partially responsible for the shortfall. The administration also reported its benefit rate for employees would drop from 74.2% to 69.9% in fiscal year 2012, a result of the new contracts with unions. School Board Director Larry Miller said he was surprised the health-care concessions the union agreed to didn't have a larger impact on the benefit rate. MPS Superintendent Gregory Thornton said he was also disappointed the rate hadn't dropped more significantly, but that the calculation was correct. Teachers' average salaries are increasing next year, from $56,500 to $59,500 in 2011-'12. When wages and benefits are combined, an average teacher will make $101,091 next year, said Budget Manager Deborah Wegner. Other components of the preliminary budget picture include: A plan to centralize budgets for guidance positions and long-term leave situations Changing how early childhood 3-year-old programs are funded Trimming 4-year-old kindergarten aide positions What to do about the loss of funding for a class-size reduction program in kindergarten through third grades. According to MPS, 27 schools may lose the program. That original number was 28, but one school shifted around its funding to solve the problem, according to the administration. School Board Director Terry Falk said the budget committee will meet again March 3 to discuss the impact of the governor's budget. The administration is scheduled to release its proposed budget on April 26. A series of public hearings will be held after that in May.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/04/maciver-institute/maciver-institute-says-average-annual-salary-and-b/,Politics,Polifact
22656,Caller posing as major GOP contributor dupes Walker,"Madison  Scott Walker took a prank phone call Tuesday, and Wisconsin learned a lot about its new governor. A recording of the call released Wednesday spelled out Walker's strategies for dealing with protesting union workers and trying to lure Democrats boycotting the state Senate back to Wisconsin. Speaking with whom he believed to be billionaire conservative activist David Koch, Walker said he considered - but rejected - planting troublemakers amid protesters who have rocked the Capitol for a week. He told the caller he feared a ""ruckus"" would ""scare the public into thinking maybe the governor has to settle to avoid this problem."" He also described a plan to get his bill taking away union rights passed without Democrats who have boycotted the Senate. He said he talked to a Democratic senator for 45 minutes who he thought could help even though ""he's not one of us."" Walker discussed ways Koch - a financer of the conservative group Americans for Prosperity - could help Republican legislators, presumably with TV and radio ads. Walker showed no indication on the tape he was aware the call was a prank. The 20-minute talk was actually with Ian Murphy, a blogger from Buffalo, N.Y., who edits the Buffalo Beast website. On the call, Walker likened his tough stance on the bill to former President Ronald Reagan successfully combating the air traffic controllers union three decades ago. ""That was the first crack in the Berlin Wall, in the fall of Communism, because from that point forward the Soviets and the Communists knew that Ronald Reagan wasn't a pushover,"" Walker said, according to the recording. In a Wednesday news conference, Walker said his remarks to the prank caller jibed with his public comments and downplayed the significance of the conversation. ""I take phone calls all the time,"" he said, noting he'd spoken with small-business people and average taxpayers. ""Now I'm not going to allow one crank phone call to be a distraction. The reality is we have a job to do. And the job is to debate this bill."" Walker's bill would balance this year's budget, repeal most union bargaining rights for public employees and give Walker's administration broad powers to reshape state health programs for the poor. It has sparked nonstop protests in the Capitol since last week from unions. They have said they are willing to give as much as Walker is asking in concessions on health care and pensions, but have demanded that he not take away most bargaining rights. Influential conservative Koch is co-owner of Koch Industries, an energy and consumer products company that owns Georgia-Pacific paper mills in Wisconsin. He is a philanthropist and a chief backer of Americans for Prosperity, which helped stage tea party rallies in Wisconsin in 2009 and 2010 and on Wednesday announced it was spending $342,200 on advertising to persuade Wisconsin residents to back Walker's plan. ""The caller was not David Koch and we have no further response to this fraudulent act at this time,"" said a statement from Mark Holden, a senior vice president with Koch Industries. Koch Industries' political action committee was one of the biggest financial supporters of Walker's gubernatorial campaign last fall, giving $43,000 to his political fund. Koch also gave $1 million to the Republican Governors Association last year, and Koch Industries contributed another $50,000. The RGA spent $65,000 on ads supporting Walker and an additional $3.4 million attacking Mayor Tom Barrett, Walker's Democratic opponent. On Tuesday, the RGA launched a website promoting Walker's stance against unions called StandWithScott.com. Walker has never spoken with Koch or his brother and business partner, Charles Koch, according to Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie. The sweeping budget-repair bill Walker is now pushing includes a clause that would allow this administration to sell 37 state-owned heating and power plants without taking bids - a provision sparking criticism that the plants could be sold to Koch Industries. A company official has said the firm has no interest in buying the plants, and Walker said the measure was not aimed at helping the company. ""Absolutely nothing to that - 100% wrong,"" Walker said in the news conference. He said he'd supported the idea of selling the plants back in the 1990s, when he was in the Assembly. He did not say why he wrote the bill to allow them to be sold without taking bids. ""We're going to have an open and accessible process,"" Walker said. The state Assembly began debating the budget-repair bill at noon Tuesday, and continued to do so late Wednesday. Action in the Senate has been stalled since Feb. 17, when all 14 Democrats went to Illinois. Twenty senators must be present to pass bills that spend money, and the Republicans have only 19 seats. Walker said during the call he would agree to speak with Democratic legislative leaders if all 14 senators return to Madison. He said he believes if Democrats return to the Capitol, the Senate would have a quorum and could approve the budget-repair bill - even if Democrats again left before the vote was called. ""Legally, we believe once they've gone into session, they don't physically have to be there"" at that point, Walker said. In response, Murphy said Walker should bring a baseball bat to the meeting with Senate Democrats. Walker laughed at the joke and noted he has a baseball bat in his office. ""I've got a (Louisville) Slugger with my name on it,"" he said. Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) said he found Walker's plan to ""trick"" Democrats disturbing and showed Democrats can't trust any overtures from Walker to talk. Walker said it wasn't a trick. Murphy suggested the idea of placing troublemakers amid the crowd of protesters. Walker responded: ""The only problem with that - because we thought about that. The problem with - my only gut reaction to that would be, right now the lawmakers I've talked to have just completely had it with them. The public is not really fond of this. ""My only fear is if there's a ruckus caused that would scare the public into thinking maybe the governor has to settle to avoid all these problems."" In the news conference, Walker said he considers many options presented by staff. ""As you've heard on the tape, we dismissed that and said that wasn't a good idea,"" Walker said. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau) said he never considered planting agitators in the crowd. He also said he'd never talked to Walker about the plan to bring Democrats back to Wisconsin and then have the Senate vote on the bill. Murphy asked how he could help Walker, and Walker said he wanted calls from the public to any wavering Republicans to continue. ""The more they get that reassurance, the easier it is for them to vote yes,"" Walker said. ""The other thing is more long term and that is that after this, the days and weeks and months ahead, particularly in these more swing areas, a lot of these guys - they don't necessarily need ads for them, but they are going to need a message out reinforcing why this is a good thing to do for the economy and a good thing to do for the state."" In the news conference, Walker said he was not talking about political campaigns when he discussed such a message. ""This isn't about a campaign,"" he said. ""It's about getting a message out about the truth."" The governor said in the call he spoke with Sen. Tim Cullen (D-Janesville) for 45 minutes on Saturday and he hopes the independent-minded lawmaker can influence his colleagues to return. Murphy said he would try calling Cullen, but Walker advised him not to because ""he's not one of us."" During the call, Walker sounded at ease as he talked of going on national TV and radio shows and conversing with other governors. At the end of the call, Murphy told Walker: ""Once you crush these bastards, I'll fly you out to (California) and really show you a good time."" Walker replied: ""All right. That would be outstanding."" Walker is the latest politician to be embarrassed when what he thought was a private conversation went public. Just before the 2008 presidential election, Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin took a call from a radio DJ posing as French President Nicolas Sarkozy. The Buffalo Beast's website was inaccessible much of Wednesday, apparently because so many people flooded the site. Murphy said he first spoke with Walker's chief of staff, Keith Gilkes. Murphy used the Internet service Skype to make the call and didn't have a return number to give Gilkes, so he made up a story about his maid dropping his phone in the washer. That gambit worked, and Murphy was connected with Walker when he called back at 2 p.m. Murphy wasn't surprised to learn Walker's office said he'd never talked to the real Koch. ""He did sound very thrilled to finally get the chance,"" Murphy said.

22662,Assemblys abrupt adjournment caps chaotic day in Capitol,"Madison - The Assembly teetered on the brink of chaos Friday evening but then adjourned peacefully after Republicans rescinded a vote on Gov. Scott Walker's budget-repair bill that the GOP lawmakers took without Democrats present. The high political drama came as the standoff on the politically charged bill dragged on, Democratic senators hid out in Illinois, a throng of tens of thousands demonstrated at the Capitol and national figures weighed in on the events. In fast-moving events Friday: Leaders of the state's biggest public worker unions said they would give in to the governor's demand for concessions on workers' benefits if Walker would give up his bid to repeal nearly all public union bargaining rights; Walker rejected that offer, saying government needed more flexibility in dealing with its employees; and the governor's address on the next two-year budget was delayed by a week. No clear exit from the chaos could be seen for either side. During the fourth straight day of demonstrations, the chanting, drumming and marching crowds of union supporters swelled to their largest numbers yet but remained peaceful, with no arrests or incidents reported. Meanwhile tea party groups from around the country planned a large counterdemonstration for Madison on Saturday. Wisconsin's fight over union rights plays out against a national backdrop as other states such as Ohio consider similar moves. In the Wisconsin Assembly on Friday, Republican leaders had called lawmakers to the floor at 5 p.m. to take up Walker's bill to fix a budget shortfall by cutting public worker benefits and bargaining rights. But they began business just before that hour, when Democrats were not yet on the floor. Democrats charged into the chamber and shouted to stop the action as Republican staff urged their leaders to ""keep going, keep going."" Republicans took the voice vote, putting the bill in a stage that prevented it from being amended in that house. Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca (D-Kenosha) called the move an ""illegal vote"" and demanded that Republicans rescind it. ""Unbelievable!"" Barca screamed. ""Unprecedented! Un-American! Not in keeping with the values of the state! You should be ashamed of yourselves."" Minutes later, Republicans agreed to effectively cancel the vote by allowing the bill to return to a stage in which Democrats can offer amendments. Democrats may have dozens of them, and the debate on the bill - whenever it happens - is expected to take hours. The Assembly adjourned until Tuesday. Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald (R-Horicon) said he started taking votes because he did not believe Democrats would show up. In the Senate, Democrats have blocked a vote since Thursday on the budget repair bill by leaving the state. ""I wanted to see if they were going to come to the floor,"" Fitzgerald said of Democrats. ""I had to force the issue, but obviously they did come."" In the Assembly galleries, union supporters erupted in cheers as that house adjourned without passing the bill. Fitzgerald said that the events were not a defeat and that he still has the votes to approve the bill. ""Democracy isn't pretty all the time,"" he said. In the Senate, his brother, Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau), also said he still has the votes he needs. ""If anything, what's going on in this building is galvanizing the (Republican) caucus,"" Fitzgerald said. Earlier Friday, Marty Beil, head of the Wisconsin State Employees Union, said his members would agree to pay more of their pension contributions and health insurance benefits as Walker is demanding. But Beil said his union would never agree to give up decades-old bargaining rights. Beil's union is part of AFSCME, the largest state and local employee union in Wisconsin, which represents 68,000 workers for the state, Milwaukee, Milwaukee County and other municipalities. An AFSCME spokesman said Beil was speaking for all the group's union locals in the state. ""We are prepared to implement the financial concessions proposed to help bring our state's budget into balance, but we will not be denied our God-given right to join a real union . . . we will not - I repeat we will not - be denied our rights to collectively bargain,"" Beil said in a statement. Mary Bell, the president of the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the state's largest teachers union, said her group also would make the financial concessions to keep its bargaining rights. ""This is not about money,"" Bell said in a phone conference. ""We understand the need to sacrifice."" No compromise seen Walker flatly rejected the offer. He said local governments and schools will need that flexibility with their employees to cope with cuts in their state aid that he wants to make to help balance the state budget. ""It doesn't work,"" Walker said of the offer in an interview. ""My goal all along has been to give all these folks - I asked for it in the past - the tools to control their own budgets . . . I know as a (former) local official, collective bargaining time and time again was the thing that stood in the way of local governments and school districts being able to manage their budgets."" During the interview, the thick walls of Walker's orderly office muted the thunderous shouts of demonstrators just a short distance away. Walker acknowledged getting little sleep through the demonstrations but looked unruffled and resolved. Walker pointed out that in December the state unions sought - unsuccessfully - to have Democrats then controlling the Legislature pass labor contracts that would have run through June. The no-pay-raise contracts would have included modest benefits concessions but would have also blocked for several months Walker's ability to reach the deeper cuts in benefits that he is seeking. ""Let's not kid ourselves. The reality is, it's about the money,"" Walker said. Also Friday, Walker delayed his address on the 2011-'13 budget bill until March 1. The governor had planned to deliver the speech Tuesday at a Madison manufacturer - a departure from past practice - but will now give the speech in the usual location, the state Assembly chambers. Democratic activist the Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. arrived in Madison on Friday to cheer the union crowds in speeches inside and outside the Capitol and denounce Republicans' actions. Sen. Fitzgerald responded that Jackson's appearance and recent comments by President Barack Obama on the budget standoff showed that Wisconsin has become a leader for states nationwide that are struggling with difficult budget deficits in the face of a prolonged economic downturn. At 9:30 on Friday morning, Republicans came to the floor and did a call for all senators to come to the floor. But for the second straight day, Democrats stayed in Illinois - a move that blocks a Senate vote on Walker's bill. Sen. Fitzgerald blasted Democrats for boycotting the Senate, saying he has barely had any contact with them. ""They won't call me back,"" he said. State troopers were sent to the Monona home of Senate Minority Leader Mark Miller to bring him to the Senate, but the Democrat wasn't there. ""My colleagues and I continue to work to stop state government from taking away rights from workers,"" Miller said in a statement. ""We continue to call on the governor and Republicans to allow us to get serious about addressing fiscal issues and creating jobs and drop the unrelated items that do nothing to help us balance our budget."" If troopers do find Democrats, they will not arrest them, Fitzgerald said. ""It's never going to happen, that's the point,"" Fitzgerald said. ""I don't know what the practical ability to force a senator to sit in their chair and vote (is)."" While the Assembly has adjourned until next week, the Senate can convene at a moment's notice if Democrats are found. Republicans did not say whether they would consider coming into session over the weekend. In an interview, Sen. Jim Holperin (D-Conover) said he and his Democratic Senate colleagues will be back. ""We won't obstruct the vote forever,"" Holperin said. ""We are within range of the Capitol if we need to be."" The Capitol Police said there were no incidents and no arrests Friday, but Republicans said they had security concerns amid what they considered a tense atmosphere. Sen. Randy Hopper (R-Fond du Lac), who has prisons employing many state workers in or near his district, said he had received threats such as ""I have a billy club and I will use it."" He said he had not received any death threats and would not be intimidated. After action ended in each house, law enforcement escorted Republican legislators out of the Capitol and through the crowds that demonstrated late into the night.

22773,Estate tax repeal among 18 bills Ohio House GOP introduces to advance agenda,"COLUMBUS, Ohio - The new Republican majority in the Ohio House of Representatives introduced a plan to repeal the Ohio estate tax on Tuesday, along with other bills to advance an agenda they say is focused on job creation. Of the 18 bills introduced Tuesday, some dealt directly with the economy while others sought to change laws regarding pit bulls and speeding tickets. Eliminating the estate tax, however, stood out for its broad support among Republicans, Gov. John Kasich and at least one House Democrat. ""Ben Franklin once quipped that only two things in life were certain: death and taxes,"" said Rep. Jay Hottinger, a Republican from Newark. ""I think even he didn't envision that the tax man would visit on the day of your death -- and that's something that needs to end here in the state of Ohio."" House Republicans said repealing the tax was only one piece of a broader plan to change the way state and local governments deliver services to Ohioans. ""In the days and weeks and short months ahead, how state government and how local government functions, what services are delivered, and how those services are delivered are going to be transformed unlike they have ever been in the history of the state of Ohio,"" Hottinger said. Referred to by some Republicans as the ""death tax,"" an estate tax of up to 7 percent is levied on the net value of an estate before its assets are transferred to anyone else. Ohio doesn't tax estates worth $338,333 or less, due to an available tax credit. Republicans said the tax puts Ohio at a disadvantage because 30 other states have no such tax. The plan introduced Tuesday calls for the tax to be repealed for deaths on or after Jan. 1 of this year. But eliminating the tax would be a blow to municipalities, which receive about 80 percent of estate tax revenue. That amounted to about $231 million in the last fiscal year. Rep. Mike Foley, a Democrat from Cleveland, criticized the GOP plan, saying the tax helps address the imbalance of wealth in this country by taxing the wealthy. He also lamented the loss of funds to local governments. ""Without it, local governments will be forced to cut services and further contemplate raising taxes on their own citizens to make up for the shortfall,"" Foley said. Other bills introduced Tuesday would:  Authorize Kasich, a Republican, to create JobsOhio, the private, nonprofit economic development corporation he will establish to replace the Ohio Department of Development.  Establish tax credits for employers who hire unemployed people and for businesses that expand into vacant buildings.  Prohibit late-term abortions. Rep. Lorraine Fende, a Democrat from Willowick, introduced the bill.  Take pit bulls off the state's ""vicious dog"" list.  Prohibit speeding tickets based on an officer's visual estimation of speed of a motor vehicle. House Speaker William G. Batchelder, a Medina Republican, said the legislation introduced Tuesday reflects the priorities of the entire GOP caucus, not merely those of the leaders. Batchelder said he intends to promote an inclusive atmosphere this General Assembly. Kasich also promoted cooperation Tuesday in a speech to lawmakers over lunch at the Statehouse. Kasich, who was sworn in Monday, focused on the upcoming state budget, which has a projected $8 billion shortfall. The loudest voices in the budget discussions will belong to Kasich and Republicans with majorities in the House and Senate. But the new governor urged Democrats to help find solutions and to join the fight against special interest groups. The special interest groups are ""going to come here and they're going to fight,"" Kasich said Tuesday. ""And if they win the fight . . . it's going to be more on people that have less."" Immediately after Kasich's speech promoting bipartisanship, the Senate fell back into the political bickering that marked the end of its session last year, when Republicans rejected nearly 80 of former Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland's appointees on Dec. 21. Senate Republicans voted Tuesday to reject an additional 14 appointments Strickland made in response to the Senate's rejections last month. The Senate rejected Strickland's appointments because Republicans felt Kasich should be able to fill those positions. ""What the Senate did today was tell Ohioans they need not apply for public service if they are appointed by a governor affiliated with the wrong political party,"" said Sen. Nina Turner, a Democrat from Cleveland.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2011/jan/21/jay-hottinger/rep-jay-hottingers-assessment-founding-father-unfo/,Politics,Polifact
22791,Florida Senate president: Cuts in education funding are likely,"Florida Senate president: Cuts in education funding are likely Haridopolos said policymakers would be passing a budget this spring without any new tax increases, which means they would have to make dramatic cuts to health care and education to make the math work. TALLAHASSEE  Florida Senate President Mike Haridopolos signaled Wednesday that the Legislature was unlikely to take up any big-ticket tax cuts this year given Florida's $3.62-billion projected budget shortfall, and that education could also face big cuts to patch the holes. ""I'm a big proponent of tax cuts. This is not a year I can push them through,"" the Brevard County lawmaker told reporters. And if Gov. Rick Scott wants to follow through on his campaign pledge of cutting taxes by $2 billion in his first year in office, Haridopolos said the governor would have to offset them with spending cuts. Scott has proposed to cut school property taxes by $1.4 billion and make up the millage reduction with more state dollars. He also promised to start phasing out Florida's corporate income tax, which could cost another $700 million this year. ""I think Rick Scott has a lot of ideas.  Any tax cut proposal would have to be met with equal spending cuts to make it viable,"" Haridopolos said. Although the governor has said the corporate tax cuts, in particular, could make it easier to lure new jobs to Florida, Haridopolos said he didn't think the state could afford it now. ""I don't see that happening at this point. It's something I'd like to do  but $3.5 billion short, and the problems with no tax increases, I don't see the math yet,"" Haridopolos said. Scott, in a brief session with reporters at the state's emergency operations center, indicated he's not ready to abandon his proposed tax cuts. ""The way to get the state back to work is to cut property taxes and phase out the corporate income tax, and we're going to get that done,"" Scott said. The Senate president said education could be particularly hard-hit in next year's budget, saying it may be impossible to make up for about $1.2 billion in expiring federal stimulus dollars that are financing core classroom programs. ""Whether you like to admit it or not, half our general revenue goes to education,"" Haridopolos told reporters. ""It's a very difficult spot to be in, and the reason we wanted to make the adjustments to the class-size amendment"" defeated by voters last fall. Sen. David Simmons, chairman of the Senate's school budget committee, acknowledged that it would be difficult to maintain education spending at current-year levels. The Maitland Republican had previously expressed more optimism that school funding would be spared significant cuts.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2011/jan/14/mike-haridopolos/florida-senate-president-warns-education-funding-c/,Politics,Polifact
22961,Transcript of Florida Gubernatorial Debate with CNNs John King,"KING: That was a minute and five seconds. Mr. Scott, take the same. SCOTT: All right. I dealt with the same sort of issue back in 1992 when Hurricane Andrew hit. I had a lot of hospitals down in Miami, and I was down there right after the hurricane hit. We had to completely evacuate one hospital, which was basically demolished. And I showed up, we had over 500 employees without homes. We had 154 patients in the hospital. I got nurses from the west coast of Florida over there within eight or nine hours, and I reopened two hospitals, and I stayed down there until it was solved. We did a fundraiser for all of our employees to make sure that they had the money to get back into their homes. Thats what you do. What they should  what Governor Crist and my opponent should have been doing down there, they should have stayed down there until the problem was solved. They should have been talking to all those local businesses. Ive been down there. And also explain that, you know, the beaches were basically open. I mean, we should  we should have been down there when they had all that possibility to be on national TV to say, look, the oil spill is not here. Part of the reason we hurt our tourism is the fact that, you know, we played the game, that oh, poor me. Theres problems down here. When the truth is, our beaches were pretty much spotless. (CROSSTALK) SMITH:  much of an environmentally plan. Essentially, watered-down growth management and you want to be receptive to drilling. What would you tell people, Florida has a long story of being environmentalist? SCOTT: Absolutely. You know, we all live  you know, we all live here because we love this environment. You know, we love the weather, we love the beaches, we love the Everglades, we love our lakes and rivers. And so, what we got to do is make sure we do everything we can, possibly can, to make sure we continue that. We restore the Everglades. We make sure we have the best water standards and things like that. At the same time, we got to make sure that, right now, our biggest issue is jobs. We need jobs. And so, what you have to balance is you have to balance the need that we got to keep a pristine environment, but we cant be raising taxes and we got  to build jobs, so I have a seven-step plan to get the state going back to work. KING: Im going to give you 30 seconds to respond his  what he just said about the environment, then we need to take a quick break. SINK: OK. Thank you. Well my opponent has said that he would do away with the Department of Community Affairs. Its the one state agency that holds local governments accountable for the dealings they have with developers. Thats why we have Amendment Four on the ballot because people were so frustrated about these out of control developments. I oppose Amendment Four because I think it would be a job killer. But we cannot do away with our Department of Community Affairs which is the only organization that handles growth management in Florida. He would just hand Florida over to development, to just go wild and thats not what Floridians want. (CROSSTALK) KING: I will give you a chance to respond. (CROSSTALK) KING: I will give you a chance to respond when we come back. (CROSSTALK) KING: Were going to take another quick break. The candidates for Florida governor are debating right here. Stay with us. (APPLAUSE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KING: Were back with the candidates for Florida governor, Republican Rick Scott, Democrat Alex Sink. We talked a bit earlier about the Arizona immigration law, and many states saying after this election they may try and copy it in their states. Another law Mr. Scott that a lot of conservatives want to copy is a new Nebraska abortion law. It essentially tries to redefine the abortion debate by saying the standard should not be viability, when the fetus can live outside the womb, but when the fetus can feel pain. The Nebraska abortion law sets that at 20 weeks. Would you support such a law and sign such a law into law here in the state of Florida? SCOTT: Lets go back to the last question on DCA. I have not said that I would eliminate DCA. What I would do is go back to the original purpose of DCA. My opponent is an Obama liberal. She thinks people in Tallahassee can tell local communities exactly what they ought to do. Lets look at whats happened across our state. You can go all across the state and developments have been killed by all the regulation, all the paperwork. In fact you have to go to three or four agencies. Ill give you an example. Down close where I live, Ave Maria University was recently built. Just in permits, just  not any building  just for the land, 78 permits, took years to do. DCA has killed jobs all across this state. We need to go back to the original purpose. SCOTT: With regard to abortion, I am pro-life. Im pro-life with the exceptions of rape, incest, and the life of the mother. KING: And would you sign a law that said the standard should be after 20 weeks, when the Nebraska law supporters say they have researched that fetus can feel the pain, would you sign that? Essentially under current law in most states it is 23 weeks or so most research shows when a fetus can live outside the womb. So it takes about three weeks to a month sliding back the line. Would you sign a law that said at 20 weeks, after 20 weeks no abortions? SCOTT: Yes. KING: Would you sign that law? SINK: No, I wouldnt because I support the laws that we have on the books right now in Florida. KING: And support them, thats it, a blanket support for abortion rights or when new medical and technology advances come into play, would you look at that? SINK: I follow the law, and I will uphold the law that we have in Florida currently, which does have restrictions, like parental notification. Thats what I support. But I have to go back and say something here about this debate tonight, because I know that our time is running short. And I dont think that the people of Florida have really heard yet what they need to hear from me and from my opponent. I have received the endorsement of 16 Florida newspapers. Every single newspaper that has endorsed has endorsed my candidacy, because they know that I have the character and the integrity and they also know that I have the business plan, that Im a fiscal conservative to carry our state forward in a matter that all Floridians can be proud of. My opponent, on the other hand, has refused to appear before a single editorial board, which is the first time in the history of this state SMITH: We have done a lot of talk about character and integrity. But we have  were going to have  our state is in serious financial trouble. Next year were going to have  we have had a Republican legislature for years. Next year it could have two very, very conservative leaders. There is not going to be sort of a moderating force, whether it was Charlie Crist or the Florida Senate. Have you seen anywhere that the Florida legislature has gone too far, too conservative in recent years, Ms. Sink? SINK: Oh Id be happy to respond to that. Just this year, they passed a slush fund bill to permit political slush funds and reintroduce slush funds into state government like Florida had many years ago. Governor Crist vetoed that bill, rightfully so. Maybe the best example is the Senate Bill Six that was passed. It was called a teacher pay bill, but actually if you look at the details and what the parents and the superintendents and the school board members actually knew that it was, it was a takeover by Tallahassee politicians and bureaucrats of local school making decisions. Those decisions ought to be made locally. That was rightfully vetoed. This Senate and House should have passed ethics reforms bills. We have had so much corruption all over the state and also look at the abuses in Tallahassee, credit cards, people losing  people leaving office.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/oct/26/alex-sink/sink-claims-scott-said-he-wants-do-away-state-dca/,Politics,Polifact
23068,Where's the Revolution?,"Features Where's the Revolution? Photo by iStockPhoto.com Note: Register for this months CLE, This Land Is Whose Land?, from 1-2 p.m. ET on Wednesday, April 15. Susette Kelo still misses the home she was forced to leave in 2007. It was a small, pink clapboard house (above) located in a working-class neighborhood of New London, Conn., at the edge of the Thames River just before it spills into Long Island Sound. The house wasnt luxurious, but Kelo was happy after moving there in 1997. It was a real neighborhood back then, she says. We watched out for each other. New London city officials, however, had other plans for the Fort Trumbull neighborhood where Kelo lived. After the federal government closed the Naval Undersea Warfare Center in 1996, taking some 1,500 jobs with it, the city was on a downward slide with rising unemployment and falling population. Those concerns gave rise to a plan to redevelop the Fort Trumbull area just south of the city center by replacing the single-family homes and small businesses there with high-end riverfront condominiums, restaurants, offices and a resort hotel. In January 2000, the New London City Council authorized the private, nonprofit New London Development Corp. to purchase 90 acres in the Fort Trumbull peninsula. The council also empowered the corporation to acquire land by eminent domain if any property owners refused to sell. Most owners did sell their properties to the corporation, but Kelo and a handful of others held outone of them had been born in her house in 1918 and lived there ever since. They battled in state and federal courts for five years, challenging the towns right to condemn their properties. The property owners took their fight all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. In the end, a sharply divided court ruled against them. By a 5-4 vote in Kelo v. City of New London, the justices ruled in 2005 that the citys actions did not violate the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment. The majority opinion emphasized that the court has consistently interpreted the public use requirement in the takings clause to broadly encompass public purposes such as redevelopment plans, even if they call for transferring ownership from one private party to another. Those who govern the city were not confronted with the need to remove blight in the Fort Trumbull area, but their determination that the area was sufficiently distressed to justify a program of economic rejuvenation is entitled to our deference, wrote Justice John Paul Stevens in his majority opinion. Because that plan unquestionably serves a public purpose, the takings challenged here satisfy the public-use requirement of the Fifth Amendment, Stevens concluded. The ruling set off a firestorm of indignation across the country. The notion that government may take one persons property and give it to someone else in the name of economic redevelopment struck many as drastically out of line with American principles of private ownership. Organizations and politicians across the ideological spectrum excoriated the Supreme Courts decision. In one national survey, 81 percent of the respondents disagreed with the decision. Kelo opened up the nations eyes to abuses that were going on all over the country: taking private property for purely economic purposes and transferring it to other private entities so they could essentially make a profit off somebody elses land, says Darius W. Dynkowski, a partner at Ackerman Ackerman & Dynkowski, a firm in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., that represents private property owners in eminent domain cases. He also chairs the Condemnation Committee in the ABA Section of Real Property, Trust and Estate Law. A legal upheaval followed the political upheaval. Or did it? ACTION APLENTY Without question, both legislatures and courts have been busy addressing the issue. In the nearly four years since the Supreme Courts ruling in Kelo, 43 states have enacted statutes or constitutional amendments restricting the use of eminent domain. Meanwhile, at least five state supreme courts have issued rulings that significantly impede government power to take private property. At the federal level, both Congress and the executive branch acted to limit Kelo-type takings. But there are dramatically conflicting views about whether these actions are going to change much about how governments at the local, state and federal levels use their eminent domain powers to advance redevelopment plans. Some experts say the reaction to Kelo has largely stopped the eminent domain bulldozer in its tracks. Its an enormous change, says Dana Berliner, a senior attorney in the Washington, D.C., office of the Institute for Justice, a libertarian public-interest law firm that represented Kelo and her neighbors in their Supreme Court case. Ive heard academics say that the changes arent that big, but from our position on the ground thats not true. Before any of this began, we were getting complaints about eminent domain abuse from around the entire country. Now the complaints are coming from pockets of states that dont have good legislation or supreme court rulings. Its been a major reduction. Berliner credits this shift to post-Kelo laws and rulings. Most states, either through legislation or judicial decision, have largely moved away from using eminent domain for private economic development, she says. But other experts arent sure just how much the sound and fury following Kelo really signifies. Most states have enacted some kind of legislation, but most of it doesnt do very much, says Steven J. Eagle, a professor at George Mason University School of Law in Arlington, Va., who chairs the Condemnation Law Committee in the ABA Section of State and Local Government Law. With very few exceptions, most of the statutes arent in states where this [economic taking] was done anyway. Susan K. Spurgeon, vice-chair of the ABA real estate sections Condemnation Committee, says, Kelo did not significantly change the law. The decision relied on years of federal precedents going back to Berman v. Parker, a takings case that the Supreme Court decided in 1954, says Spurgeon, a shareholder at Pennington, Moore, Wilkinson, Bell & Dunbar in Tampa, Fla. In Berman, the justices ruled 9-0 that Washington, D.C., officials acted within their powers when they condemned a department store in a blighted area that was slated for redevelopmenteven though the stores owner maintained that it was a viable, going concern. In his opinion, Justice William O. Douglas articulated an expansive view of eminent domain powers. The concept of the public welfare is broad and exclusive, Douglas wrote. The values it represents are spiritual as well as physical, aesthetic as well as monetary. And, he concluded, the goal of the redevelopment planto create a better balanced, more attractive communitymet the test for a valid public use. Moreover, wrote Douglas, we cannot say that public ownership is the sole method of promoting the public purposes of community redevelopment projects. The majority opinion in Kelo was consistent with the Supreme Courts expansive interpretations of public purpose in Berman and more recent cases. Without exception, our cases have defined that concept broadly, reflecting our long-standing policy of deference to legislative judgments in this field, wrote Justice Stevens for the court. A SETTLING FOUNDATION Nevertheless, some experts maintain that Kelo actually signaled a subtle shift in the Supreme Courts thinking about eminent domain powers. The first sign they point to is the slim 5-4 vote in Kelo compared to the 9-0 landslide in Berman. And they have interpreted even Stevens majority opinion as somewhat tepid in its affirmation of New Londons use of eminent domain powers. Justice Stevens, writing for the courts liberal wing, spoke only of stare decisis and federalism, Eagle says. Even then, he tempered the opinion with the observation that states could adopt stricter standards. Specifically, Stevens wrote that nothing in our opinion precludes any state from placing further restrictions on its exercise of the takings power. Further, he noted, as the submissions of the parties and their amici make clear, the necessity and wisdom of using eminent domain to promote economic development are certainly matters of legitimate public debate. Meanwhile, Justice Sandra Day OConnors dissenting opinionjoined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomasargued that the majority had taken the power of government to condemn private property for public use too far. Under the banner of economic development, all private property is now vulnerable to being taken and transferred to another private owner, so long as it might be upgradedi.e., given to an owner who will use it in a way that the legislature deems more beneficial to the publicin the process, OConnor wrote. The effect of that reasoning is to wash out any distinction between private and public use of propertyand thereby effectively to delete the words for public use from the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment. It became quickly evident that the public, elected officials and even some other courts did not want Kelo to be the final word on how government should wield its eminent domain powers. Legislators came under tremendous political pressure to rein in those powers. The legislature in Arkansas did not change its law on eminent domain after Kelo. Neither did lawmakers in Hawaii, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York or Oklahoma. But the remaining 43 states did. KERFUFFLE OVER FED FUNDS So did the federal government. in november 2005, Congress enacted the Bond Amendment as part of a larger bill. The amendment forbids recipients of federal transportation or housing grants to use that money to support the use of eminent domain powers to advance economic development that primarily benefits private entities. But the measure is largely cosmetic, says Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University, because it does not apply to mass transit or highway projects, or projects aimed at eliminating blight. As a result, hardly any projects receiving transportation or housing grants are actually subject to the prohibitions. And even in those cases, proving that a development project primarily benefits private entities is difficult. On June 23, 2006, President George W. Bush marked the first anniversary of the Kelo decision by signing, with much fanfare, an executive order that barred the federal government from engaging in Kelo-type takings. The order had some public relations effect for the administration, but there was little actual substantive impact, if only because federal agencies rarely invoke eminent domain powers in conjunction with economic development projects. Those actions ordinarily take place at the state and local government levels. And like the legislation passed by Congress, the exemptions contained in the order leave the federal government free to engage in any condemnations it might want to pursue, Somin says. Most of the restrictions on eminent domain powers that state legislatures passed during the post-Kelo furor also lack teeth, concludes Somin in an article scheduled for the June issue of the Minnesota Law Review. The primary reason why so many of these laws are ineffectiveSomin puts 23 of them in that categoryis that they still allow state and local governments to use eminent domain to condemn private property to facilitate development in blighted areas. In many states, the definition of blight is so open-ended that almost any parcel can be considered blighted, says Eagle, Somins colleague at George Mason. In his analysis, Somin determined that 20 states have adopted laws imposing some form of effective restrictions on Kelo-type takings. These laws generally narrow the definition of blight, thus preventing officials from easily evading the ban on takings for economic development. But even some of these measures fail to go as far as might have been expected given the political backlash against Kelo, suggests Somin. Legislation adopted in Minnesota and Pennsylvania, for instance, exempts local governments in the largest metropolitan areaswhere most eminent domain actions occurfrom applying strict new restrictions for the next several years. And some of the tough restrictions on economic development takings were adopted in states like Alabama, Georgia and South Dakota, where that kind of government action is rare. The most sweeping post-Kelo limits on eminent domain powers were adopted in New Mexico and Florida, a state with an extensive history of government takings to further economic development. Those laws get their bite, according to Somin, from the fact that they abolish both Kelo-type takings and condemnations to reduce blight. In doing so, Florida and New Mexico joined Utah, which already had those limits in place, as the only states so restrictive. Others come close. Nevada and both Dakotas have prohibited condemnations that would transfer ownership of property from one private party to another. Kansas borrowed from both approaches, adopting a near-ban on private-to-private takings while significantly narrowing its definition of blight. Dana Berliner Photo by Ron Aira THE BLIGHT STUFF Supreme courts in at least five states have joined the backlash against Kelo. In 2006, the high courts in Ohio (City of Norwood v. Horney) and Oklahoma (Muskogee County v. Lowery) explicitly rejected Kelos reasoning and held that economic development is not a public use under their state constitutions. New Jerseys Supreme Court was a bit more circumspect in Gallenthin Realty Development Inc. v. Borough of Paulsboro, a 2007 decision. Even before Kelo, New Jersey law did not authorize condemnation for economic development, but did allow it to remediate blight. In Gallenthin Realty, the high court narrowed the definition of blight, holding that it must involve an actual threat to public health or safety. The Missouri Supreme Court reached a similar result when it decided Centene Plaza Redevelopment Corp. v. Mint Properties in 2007. After Kelo, the Missouri legislature banned economic development takings while continuing to allow them to remediate blight. Under the law, portions of a city are blighted if they are economic and social liabilities. The court held that this standard was not met if an area was only an economic liability. Then the court defined social liability narrowly, as a current threat to the public health, safety and welfare. (The decision did not address another Missouri statute that allows local governments to condemn properties in areas designated as blighted on the basis of economic or social liability.) A 2007 ruling by Marylands highest court did not restrict a state law that permits condemnations for economic development or blight remediation, but it did limit the use of quick-take condemnationswhere property is turned over immediately with compensation determined later. In Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Valsamaki, the Maryland Court of Appeals ruled that a government entity must prove why it needs to take immediate possession of a property before it can impose a quick-take condemnation. Even with the flurry of actions by legislatures and courts, eminent domain powers may be restricted more by public opinion than by law. In that sense, Kelo seemed to wake a sleeping giant. While the Supreme Court was following long-standing precedent rather than carving out new government powers when it decided the case, Kelo caught the publics attentionand triggered its angerin a way that previous decisions on eminent domain did not. Even though the decision upheld government condemnation powers, the close vote of the justices seemed to reflect rising public fears that the cherished right of private property ownership was subject to growing incursions by government with little to show in return. Berman licensed massive urban renewal and blight condemnations that ended up displacing hundreds of thousands of people, says Somin. At the time, most jurists and others thought that this was acceptable. Since then, serious doubts have arisen about whether we forcibly displaced huge numbers of people for little or no gain. The publics hostility to Kelo led many government officials to reconsider how they use their powers. Municipalities are doing this less than they used to because opposition to eminent domain has become much more frequent and well-organized, says Berliner of the Institute for Justice. A lot of the proposals get hit with overwhelming public opposition, so cities find a way to do without eminent domain, which is what they should have been doing all along. COOLING-OFF PERIOD Public outrage doesnt last forever, however, and as it fades, government bodies may once again start to flex their condemnation muscles. Some local officials were intimidated by the public backlash to Kelo, but that wont last, says Timothy Sandefur, an attorney at the national litigation center of the Pacific Legal Foundation in Sacramento, Calif., which represents property owners in eminent domain cases. Efforts to accomplish that are continuing. Its not a legislative issue for every single state, like it was after Kelo, Berliner says, but most state legislatures are continuing to look at this. There also is likely to be more litigation on the issue, especially as state courts are asked to interpret laws adopted in response to Kelo. Moreover, suggests Somin, maybe the Supreme Court will eventually revisit Kelo, since it was a closely contested, 5-4 case. It is possible, however, that the movement against eminent domain has peaked. In Utaha state that had adopted strict limits on condemnations of private property before Kelothe legislature had second thoughts and in 2007 passed a law that once again allows municipalities to condemn properties under plans to restore blighted neighborhoods. In November, California voters approved Proposition 99, which prohibits government entities in the state from taking a single-family residence and then transferring it to another private owner. But voters rejected a sweeping ban on all economic development takings that was put forward by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayer Association. The main proponent of Proposition 99 was the League of California Cities. We felt that if we didnt address this issue, someone else would put forward a proposition that would go far beyond limiting Kelo-like takings, says Patrick Whitnell, the leagues general counsel. Susette Kelo now lives in a house in Groton, Conn., directly across the river from where her beloved pink cottage used to be. That house is long gone, moved by her supporters to a spot near downtown New London. As for the citys ambitious development, it hasnt materialized. The private developer couldnt put together financing, so the project is in limbo and the land is vacant. For Kelo, its not a pretty sight. Im never going to forget about it, she says. It stares me in the face every day.

23530,Rick Perry: The TT Interview,"I arrived at Rick Perry's Capitol suite, accompanied by another Texas Tribune reporter and one of our photographers, around lunchtime on Thursday, April 15. We were there to capture, on tape and on film, an exclusive interview with the governor conducted as the first-ever collaboration between the Tribune and Newsweek magazine. A Newsweek photographer was also on hand, having earlier shot Perry for the cover of this week's issue, which features several pieces about Texas. Inside his office, the governor greeted us cheerfully and plopped down on a leather sofa, eager to talk about a full range of topics: the Tea Party, health care reform, Mexico, the state budget and, of course, his plans for 2012. The Q&A that follows is condensed and edited, though it includes several exchanges that do not appear in the version Newsweek published today. The full, unedited audio of the interview can be found in the right-hand column of this page, along with snippets broken out by subject. --------------- The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. Exactly one year ago today you were on the steps of Austin City Hall, talking about the possibility of secession. I was asked, What do you think about the people who shout out the word secede? And I said that we live in an incredibly wonderful country, and I see absolutely no reason for that to ever happen. But I do understand peoples concern and anger about what this administration is doing from an economic standpoint  in particular, the long-term debt thats being created for not only them but for future generations. A year later, youre more resolute about the divide between the states and the federal government. Absolutely. I think more people in the last year have picked up a copy of the Constitution and read what the Tenth Amendment says in its simplicity: that the federal government was created to be an agent for the states, not the other way around. I think that is a very, very good thing. The future of America is inextricably intertwined with the states pushing back on Washington, D.C. Our Founding Fathers had a vision of this collection of states working together but competing against each other  putting different concepts into play, seeing which ones work, which ones dont, allowing governors and legislatures to look around and say, You know what? Thats a good idea over there. The federal government wants to be the epicenter of all thought and policy and one-size-fits-all. Its very clear that we have very, very different ideas about the structure of this country and how it should work. The Tea Parties are a reflection of that. I think they are highly economic-driven. At the end of the day, it is about the economy  thats really what drives people. Government is basically saying, I dont care how hard you work. We are going to take more of [your money], because we know best how to redistribute it around the country. It really irritates a lot of Americans. You talked very early about invoking the 10th Amendment to rebut health care reform, and now you and the attorney general have joined with other states to sue the federal government. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. I think Texans do not want a government 1,500 miles removed from the state micromanaging health care. As you know, our state has the highest percentage of its citizens without insurance: senior citizens, children, working families. If you dont like reform coming out of Washington, what do you do to solve that problem? For over two years, weve had a waiver request in front of the Health and Human Services Committee  before this administration got in place, I might add  that would allow us some flexibility to use federal dollars differently than whats mandated by the federal government to create insurance opportunities for those who are uninsured today. Thats one example. I think there are a number of ways that, if the states were left to their own devices, you would see substantially more Texans who had access to health care. What we would like to see are ways to create a more efficient distribution and preventative healthcare. Lets switch gears to Mexico. Foreign policy is not often a concern of the governor of Texas  Actually, foreign policy is a concern of the governor of Texas, or it should be, every day. The reason is a 1,200-mile border with a foreign country. And the number one exporting state in America has to have substantial interest and knowledge of foreign markets. You believe that we need to do more on border security. Let me speak to the 800-pound gorilla sitting in the room, and that is the failure of Washington to do one of its primary duties: secure our border. Thats the reason I went to the Legislature in '07  prior to this administration. This was during the Bush administration, with [Michael] Chertoff as the secretary [of homeland security]. We were making pleas. We were requesting support. I talked about bringing predator drones to the border as early as '05. Those training missions were going to be flown somewhere. Why not up and down the border of the United States with Mexico? So what are we not doing in Texas that we should be doing? The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. The fact is, we shouldnt have to be doing anything. The federal governments responsibility has always been to operate the security mechanism along the border. When they proved to us that they did not have the interest or the desire, thats when we acted. Thats when we put Operation Linebacker and multiple surge operations in place. Those have been successful up to a point, but we dont have the resources or the manpower to secure the border the way it needs to be. A 1,000-troop National Guard request has been in front of this president for over a year, and no response. We are forced by Washingtons inaction to take action ourselves. You govern a state at the epicenter of the demographic change coming to this country. Theres a debate going on right now about whether, after [the protracted fight over] health care reform, Congress should take up immigration. Would you like to see some kind of reform come together? Immigration reform cant happen until you secure the border. This isnt a chicken-or-egg issue. You can have all the discussions and the debates you want, but they are all going to be failures unless and until you secure the border. We are about to enter a legislative session with a biennial budget shortfall of anywhere from $10 billion to $20 billion, depending upon on who you talk to. Last session, the federal stimulus was used to help balance our books  and to help pay down our debt from two sessions ago. By the way, if you hate the feds so much, why did you take $17 billion in stimulus money? Texas is a major donor state. We Texans send billions of dollars to Washington, D.C., in the form of federal gas taxes and income taxes. These are Texas-earned, Texas-generated dollars  monumental amounts of money, substantially more than flows back into this state. So the idea that were going to be purer than pure and not take any money back because its been identified as stimulus dollars? These are our dollars. This is our money. This session there will be no stimulus money available, so you and the lieutenant governor and the speaker have asked state agencies to cut 5 percent of their budgets. Your Democratic opponent, Bill White, refers to this as Soviet-style budgeting  he thinks having a mandate for every state agency to cut the same thing is not the best way to go. My suggestion is that he doesnt know much about the way we operate here in Austin. Its called prioritization, and weve done it before. In 2003, we had a $10 billion budget shortfall. We came into office and we addressed it, I will suggest to you, the same way we will address it 2011: We will make reductions, but we will prioritize where those cuts occur. There are a thousand people a day moving to the state of Texas. If this was a vestige of the Soviet Union, as Mr. White made reference to, Im not thinking thats what people would be beating down our doors to come to. They are coming to Texas because they know this is the only place, or one of the only places left in this country, where freedom and liberty still reign, where you can keep more of what you worked for. The idea that somehow or another Texas has gone to hell in a handbasket  if thats his campaign slogan, it will not be successful. What about the Rainy Day Fund? Theres between $8 billion and $9 billion in there. I really think its a little premature for me to be saying today, I want to use part of the Rainy Day Fund. Go back to 2003. We were able to cut a higher percentage of the budget in 2003 than wed need to in 2011. So Im going to say, Oh, gosh, we cant make that many reductions in spending. Were going to have to go into the Rainy Day Fund? Or, worse yet, Were going to have to raise taxes? I dont think you have to do that. Earlier this year I asked Mayor White if he would commit not to raising taxes? Will you commit? I dont see any reason you have to [raise taxes]. And whats happened to the city of Houston versus my record in 2003  I like my track record better. Mayor White says he reduced taxes six times as mayor. We will have a most interesting discussion of the city of Houstons financial affairs over the next six months. I want to ask you about redistricting. A range of Republicans, from [former U.S. Secretary of State] James Baker to [Land Commissioner] Jerry Patterson to [San Antonio state Sen.] Jeff Wentworth, have told me recently that the process of redrawing the maps should be depoliticized  should be taken out of the hands of politicians. Given the controversy over redistricting the last time and the desire of many people at the Capitol to avoid it this time, what should we do on that issue? Anyone who says Lets take politics out of redistricting is either naive or has another agenda that I have a hard time identifying. Youll have to ask those three whether they are nave or they have another agenda. I dont know what theyre thinking. I think the process will work. It has worked for a number of years. It has never been pleasant. And it can work without going into a special session. People need to stick around and do their jobs. Youve been in public office for more than 25 years, and you are the longest-serving governor in the history of the state. Yet youve managed to run for the last few months as an outsider. I disagree that I paint myself as somehow outside. Now, I did run a [primary] campaign as us  Texas  versus Washington. We were running against an individual who was in Washington, D.C., for 17 years. Washington is the center of bad public policy in most peoples opinion and has been for some time  not just in this current administration, though this administration is carrying it to new levels. Do you want Texas to be run the way it has been run, with a Texas-centric philosophy, or do you want this person from Washington, D.C., to come down here and use Washington-style policies and philosophies? I think the people sent a pretty strong message. A couple different times in this conversation, youve alluded to having to battle problems that predated the Obama administration. I cant help but notice that you have a bust of Ronald Reagan, who you consider to be a great president, over your shoulder. I dont see a bust anywhere of George W. Bush. Um, I dont know whether George has gotten any busts done yet. Do you consider Mr. Bush to have been a great president? At the end of the day, when the history books are written, I think George W. Bush will go down as a very, very good president. Approaching great? I dont know yet  I mean, a year and a half after hes been out of office may be a little too early to write Georges history. But here is why he was an incredibly good president: because the man kept America safe. As the president of the United States, he made one of the most difficult decisions that a sitting president ever makes: to go to war. There are two things that people judge presidents on: their safety and the economy. When you were campaigning for Rudy Giuliani in Iowa during the '08 presidential campaign, you said, George W. Bush was never a fiscal conservative. Never was. Right. Do you still believe that? I dont think he was fiscally conservative in the sense that it was his main focus day in and day out. Cutting spending and looking for ways to make government more efficient was not something that George particularly focused on. Not as governor and not as president. When you said earlier in the week at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference that America has been flying in the fog for too long, you were likewise talking about a time before Obama administration. Oh, yeah, since the '30s. If Americans want to really go back and historically engage when we really got off track, it started in 1930, with Franklin Roosevelt and the start of the Great Depression and the maneuvering of Roosevelt and Congress as they started to pull power into Washington, D.C., and create government programs and government agencies. Youre opposed to the New Deal? Yes. I think the programs created by the New Deal and the monetary jury-rigging that went on in our society exacerbated the Great Depression and pushed us farther down. The New Deal did not get America out of the Great Depression; World War II did. Generally speaking, the expansion of government at the federal level has not, by and large, been good for the American people. Everybody wants to know about your plans for 2012. In your speech at the SRLC last week, you sounded like a presidential candidate. Are you considering running and would you consider it? No and no. You are not considering running for president. You will not run for president. Thats correct. Under any circumstances? Thats correct. There is no way. No, sir. Vice president? Would you be willing to consider that? No. I dont care about going to Washington, D.C. Your party could not come to you and say, Governor, all the other alternatives are wanting. Youre our guy. There will be an alternative that is not wanting. I have a great interest in who this individual is going to be, but I want to be a governor who is leading a state. The reason I go to things like the Southern Republican Leadership Conference, the reason I am engaged in the Republican Governors Association, the reason I agree to do interviews with national publications is so that people will pay attention to what is going on in Texas. Our policies, and the results of those policies, are worth having a national dialogue about. I want people elected to Congress, to the United States Senate and to the presidency in 2012 with the express message that we are going to go to Washington and try to make Washington as inconsequential in your life as we can make it. I want the states to become the laboratories of innovation and experimentation. And I want to get this country back.

23587,This Week' Transcript: Secretaries Gates and Clinton,"TAPPER: Good morning, everyone. We start this morning with the announcement that Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens is retiring. The longest sitting justice on the court, Stevens is firmly in the liberal block, and now the president has his second Supreme Court appointment. And coming in this polarized atmosphere and an election year, the nation's capital will likely have a long, hot summer. Joining me this morning, two senators who will play key roles in the confirmation battle, Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican Jon Kyl, both members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senators, thanks so much for joining me. SCHUMER: Morning. KYL: Thank you, Jake. TAPPER: Senator Kyl, we just heard you say that you are concerned about President Obama nominating what you call an overly ideological person. We know four people on the short list include Solicitor General Elena Kagan, Judge Merrick Garland, Judge Diane Wood, and Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano. Are any of them overly ideological? KYL: It will depend upon the analysis of what they have written, what they have said, judicial decisions they've made, and what they say in hearings is when my colleagues and I, I think, would reach that conclusion. They are all nominally qualified, and again, the question I think to present is, do judges like this or candidates like this approach judging on the basis of each case presenting its unique facts and law and being decided strictly on that basis, rather than with a judge coming to the bench with an ideological position. For example, I've heard colleagues say, we want somebody who will be tough on executive powers. I've heard somebody else say, we need somebody to be tough on large corporations. No, you need somebody that will decide the case. Whether the big corporation or the executive should win a particular case depends upon the facts of the case and the law, not on the judge's ideology before that person even gets to the bench. TAPPER: Well, let me just follow up with you for a second, Senator Kyl, because Senator Jeff Sessions, the ranking Republican on Judiciary, and other colleagues of yours, have talked about the importance of this nomination because the Supreme Court will likely hear from the states who are trying to block the federal government from requirement individual citizens to get health insurance. What will you be asking the nominee when it comes to that issue? KYL: Well, first of all, you don't ask the nominee how he or she would rule on a case that's likely to come to the court. But you try to discern their attitudes. I was just in a small town in Arizona. As I drove into town, I saw a sign for the reelection of a judge, reelect Judge so-and-so. He's fair. That's all you ask for, in addition to the qualifications, which I'm sure the candidate will have. What I object to and I think my colleagues would object to is somebody that comes in with preconceived notions about how particular cases should be decided. For example, on the case of the required -- requirement that you buy insurance under the health care bill. Just decide that case based upon the reading of the law, what the precedents are and what the specific wording of the statute is. Nothing more. TAPPER: Senator Schumer, you said in 2007 that the Senate should reverse the presumption of confirmation, and that a nominee's ideology does matter. Should Republicans adopt the Schumer principle when considering President Obama's nominee? SCHUMER: Well, I think actually, in fact, Senator Kyl and I in terms of standard are saying the same thing. What you want is somebody who will follow the law, not make the law. Not impose their ideology, if they're far right, far left, on the law itself. If they're in the mainstream, you don't have to agree with all of their views to vote for them. I voted for hundreds of judges that George Bush nominated, and I didn't agree with their views, their judicial ideology. But as long as I thought they would follow the law, not make law, I was willing to vote for them. And the one final thing I'd say is this. If you look at who President Obama has nominated, somebody like Judge Sotomayor, who got nine Republicans to vote for her, no one questioned that she was out of the mainstream. The other nominees in many of the courts of appeals and district courts, he chooses people in the mainstream. So I don't think there's going to be a filibuster or a blocking. And furthermore, practically, this is not a switched vote -- a swing vote in the sense that your -- having somebody, Justice Stevens, and President Obama is likely to choose somebody in Justice Stevens' image. TAPPER: Senator Schumer, do you think that if you were giving President Obama advice, would you recommend that he go with a more moderate person ideologically, or does it matter? SCHUMER: Well, the first and most important criterion is legal excellence, and of course I think we'll find that. To me, there is a second criteria that matters a lot, and it's a little bit different. In my view at least, Justice Roberts has tried to move the court very far to the right, much further than we ever envisioned. I think Justice Stevens felt that in some of the opinions, dissents that he rendered. And he's been able to get Justice Kennedy to go along with some of those. So my view would be, I'd like the new nominee to be one of five, not one of four when the votes come up, and somebody who would be quite persuasive in terms of influencing other justices, I guess particularly Justice Kennedy, to his or her point of view. And that would matter to me more than -- more than any particular ideology. TAPPER: Senator Kyl, almost the reverse question for you when it comes to the filibuster. Throughout the Bush years, you repeatedly spoke against Democrats using the filibuster. In 2008, you said this, quote, ""It's been understood by both parties that you do not play politics when it comes to confirming judges, because while you may be able to stop the other party president's nominations one time, they might be able to stop yours next time. Besides which, it's not good government, it's not doing the people's business. The president was elected fair and square. He has the right to submit judicial nominees, and it's the Senate's obligation under the Constitution to act on those nominees. So are you willing to take the filibuster off the table? KYL: I am going to abide by what became known as the rule of the gang of 14. After President Bush was elected in 2000, Democrats successfully filibustered or threatened to filibuster 12 judges on the circuit court of appeals that were nominated by President Bush, including Miguel Estrada, an extraordinarily fine individual. And that was beginning to get out of hand, and eventually 14 senators got together and said, look, we will not filibuster any judge except in extraordinary circumstances. And that's pretty much the way that it's been ever since then. And that's why I think both Chuck and I would agree that it is unlikely that there would be a filibuster, except if there is an extraordinary circumstance. I'm never going to take it off the table because of what the Democrats have achieved here, which is the possibility of a filibuster. President Obama himself attempted to filibuster Justice Alito, who now sits on the Supreme Court. So if the president isn't going to take it off the table, I'm not going to take it off the table. But I think it can easily be avoided by appointing, frankly, the kind of person that Senator Schumer just mentioned, someone who is mainstream enough that with intellect and the application of good law can persuade colleagues to support his position or her position. SCHUMER: And the only good news, I'd say, Jake, is I think that it's just about a certainty that the president will nominate someone in the mainstream, so the likelihood of a filibuster is tiny. TAPPER: We only have a couple of minutes left, so I am going to exercise my prerogative against filibusters with you two, if you would, just bear with me and be very quick. I want to ask about a couple of international issues. Senator Schumer, the Israeli newspaper ""Yedioth Ahronot"" quoted an anonymous confidante to President -- I'm sorry, to Prime Minister Netanyahu, calling President Obama quote, ""the greatest disaster for Israel, a strategic disaster."" I'm sure you have some constituents who share those views, and perhaps those concerns. Do you think that the White House has behaved towards Israel and the prime minister of Israel as you would want them to? SCHUMER: Well, let me say this. I think everybody here in the United States, virtually everybody, and the vast majority of Israelis want peace. They're willing to accept a two-state solution. The best way to bring about that peace is let the two sides negotiate, and bring them together. I think one of the problems we have faced in the Middle East is that too many of the Palestinians, they elected Hamas, sworn to Israel's destruction, don't really believe in peace. And I do believe that you have to let the two parties come together. If the United States imposes preconditions, particularly on the Palestinian and Arab side, they'll say, we won't come and negotiate. TAPPER: Very quickly, Senator Kyl. You helped lead the cause of immigration reform in 2007. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said that he is going to bring up immigration reform. You said the other day in Yuma, Arizona, that Republicans will use the opportunity to filibuster. Are you going to help with the filibuster of immigration reform? KYL: I don't think I said that, Jake, but what I did say is that the conditions for immigration reform no longer exist. The consensus that existed before does not exist. And among other reasons, because the administration -- this current administration has not done what's necessary to secure the border and enforce the law. We just saw the tragic death of a rancher down on the border, presumably from drug smugglers or illegal immigrants, that simply illustrates once again the fact that we have not controlled the border. And until that's done, I think it's going to be very difficult for Congress to support legislation that would be as comprehensive as that I supported three years ago. TAPPER: OK, Senator Kyl and Schumer, thank you so much for joining us. We really appreciate it. Enjoy the rest of your weekend. Even before news from the Supreme Court, this has been a momentous week for the president. He signed a new nuclear arms treaty with the Russians and released a new nuclear policy. Two of the main architects of the president's nuclear policy are Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. I spoke with them Friday at the Pentagon. TAPPER: Secretary Clinton, I'd like to start with you. This has been a big week for talking about deterrents. Especially deterrents against Iran. And yet we learned that Iran is announcing the third generation of centrifuges. Six times faster than the previous generation. Is Iran not saying to the United States, ""We are not deterred""? CLINTON: Well, Jake, it has been a very positive week for American foreign policy, and particularly with respect to our nuclear posture. When it comes to Iran, we take everything they say with more than a grain of salt, because we know that they have a -- a tendency to say things that may or may not be carried out. May or may not be accurate. But in fact their belligerence is helping to make our case every single day. Countries that might have had doubts about Iranian intentions, who might have even questioned whether Iran was seeking nuclear weapons, are having those doubts dispelled as much by the evidence we present as by what comes out of the leadership of Iran. TAPPER: Secretary Gates, just a year and a half ago you had a different boss but you had the same job. And you were expressing support for the idea that nuclear weapons can be an effective deterrent against chemical and biological weapons. GATES (from October 28, 2008): ""In the first Gulf War, we made it very clear that if Saddam used chemical or biological weapons, then the United States would keep all options on the table. We later learned that this veiled threat had the intended deterrent effect as Iraq considered its options."" TAPPER: It's a refrain that a lot of Republicans have talked about that the United States is taking things off the table that would deter other countries. Did you change your mind? GATES: Well I think what's happened is the situation has changed. We have more robust deterrents today, because we've added to the nuclear deterrent missile defense. And -- and with the phased adaptive approach that the president has approved, we will have significantly greater capability to deter the Iranians, because we will have a significantly greater missile defense. We're also developing this conventional prompt global strike, which really hadn't gone anywhere in the -- in the Bush administration, but has been embraced by the new administration. That allows us to use long range missiles with conventional warheads. So we have -- we have more tools if you will in the deterrents kit bag than -- than we used to. TAPPER: Secretary Clinton, the United States according to the nuclear posture review -- the United States will not be developing new nuclear weapons. China will. Russia will. You said, when you were running for president in 2007 CLINTON (from August 2, 2007): ""Presidents should be very careful at all times in discussing the use or non-use of nuclear weapons. Presidents since the cold war have used nuclear deterrents to keep the peace. I don't believe that any president should make any blanket statements with respect to the use or non-use of nuclear weapons."" TAPPER: Did you change your mind? CLINTON: No, Jake. Because I think if you actually read the nuclear posture review, you would make three conclusions. First -- we intend to maintain a robust nuclear deterrent. Let no one be mistaken. The United States will defend ourselves, and defend our partners and allies. We intend to sustain that nuclear deterrent by modernizing the existing stockpile. In fact, we have $5 billion in this year's budget going into that very purpose. We believe, and this is a collective judgment from this government that is certainly shared by the secretary of defense, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the secretary of energy, and the others along with the State Department who worked on this nuclear posture review, that we can have the kind of deterrent that we need by modernizing our stockpile, but not necessarily having to replace and build new nuclear weapons. But if there is a conclusion down the road that there does have to be consideration for some kind of replacement, that decision will go to the president. We don't think that we'll get there. We think that we have more than an adequate nuclear deterrent. And with this emphasis on our nuclear stockpile, and the stewardship program that we are engaged in, that we'll be, you know, stronger than anybody in the world as we always have been with more nuclear weapons than are needed many times over. And so we do not see this as in any way a diminishment of what we are able to do. GATES: Let me -- let me just chime in, in this respect. The reliable replacement warhead program that existed in the past was really a means to an end. It was a means to modernizing the nuclear stockpile as Secretary Clinton says. Making it more reliable, safer, and -- and more secure. It -- that -- the policy of the Bush administration was also not to -- to -- not to add new nuclear capabilities. This was about how do you make the stockpile safer and more reliable. The approach that we now have is -- is intended to do exactly that. It offers us a path forward, as Secretary Clinton says, in terms of reuse, refurbishment, and -- and if necessary, replacement of components. Not an entire warhead necessarily. So the chiefs, and I and -- and the directors of the nuclear labs are all very comfortable that -- that this puts us in a position to modernize the stockpile and -- and the $5 billion dollars that Hillary has referred to is actually just what's in our budget to -- for this program. There is another big chunk of money in the Department of Energy budget for this infrastructure and modernization program as well. So we think this is a pretty robust approach to -- to sustaining and modernizing the stockpile. TAPPER: Let's turn to the nuclear security summit that's about to start. Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel has said he's -- he's not going to come amidst concerns that some of the Arab and Muslim countries -- Egypt and Turkey in particular -- were going to raise the worst kept secret in the world that Israel has nuclear weapons and the fact that Israel is not a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty. Don't they have a point? CLINTON: Well part of the goal of the nuclear security summit is to focus on the threat from nuclear terrorism. And we don't believe the threat from nuclear terrorism comes from states. Our biggest concern is that terrorists will get nuclear material. We fear North Korea and Iran, because their behavior as -- the first case, North Korea being -- already having nuclear weapons, and Iran seeking them -- is that they are unpredictable. They have an attitude toward countries like Israel, like their other neighbors in the Gulf that makes them a danger. So we are focusing on the two states, but we are also very concerned about nuclear material falling into terrorists' hands. And that's a concern that we all share. So part of the challenge is to bring the world together as President Obama is doing in the nuclear security summit. To have everyone sign off on an agreed upon work plan that will enable us to begin to try to tie up these loose nukes, and these loose nuclear materials. To make sure they don't fall into the wrong hands. And Israel will be represented by the deputy prime minister. And will be at the table as we begin to try to figure out how to deal with this particular problem. TAPPER: Is that a good thing, because it would have made the summit into a -- a side show? CLINTON: Well that's a decision for every government to make as to who comes and who doesn't come. So the point is that countries will be represented. And the overall goal of this nuclear security summit is to make progress. I have to say, Jake, you know this is something that Secretary Gates and I have said repeatedly. You know, the threat of nuclear war -- nuclear attack as we grew up with in the Cold War has diminished. The threat of nuclear terrorism has increased. And we want to get the world's attention focused where we think it needs to be with these continuing efforts by Al Qaeda and others to get just enough nuclear material to cause terrible havoc, destruction, and loss of life somewhere in the world. TAPPER: President Obama officials say he's contemplating presenting a peace plan to help jump start the process between the Israelis and the Palestinians. What advice do you give President Obama when it comes to whether or not he should offer a peace plan? CLINTON: Well I never share advice that I give directly to any president. TAPPER: Well then, hypothetically? CLINTON: Well -- and I don't answer hypotheticals. But I will say this. That this administration from the very first day has made it clear we are committed to pursuing a path of peace in the Middle East. And to get the two parties to get to a point where they can engage in negotiations again to deal with these very difficult final status issues. Our goal remains the resumption -- the relaunch of negotiations. Both indirect -- eventually leading to direct, and that's our focus. TAPPER: Secretary Gates, turning to Afghanistan, when you hear President Karzai refer to the 87,000 troops under your command when you -- as occupiers, and suggest that he could envision joining the Taliban, how does that affect you? Does it make your blood boil? GATES: Well I think, you know, this is a -- a man who's first of all a political leader. He has domestic audiences as well as foreign audiences. What I can tell you is that General McChrystal continues to meet with him regularly. They have a very positive relationship. He gets very good cooperation out of President Karzai. I think that the -- the Afghans are very concerned about their sovereignty. And they are very concerned that -- that it be clear who -- who is the president of Afghanistan. And -- and that he be treated with respect, because he is the representative of the people of Afghanistan and their sovereignty. And I think that -- I think that that kind of cooperative relationship, certainly that he has with -- I can only speak for General McChrystal's side of it. But I think General McChrystal feels that this is a man he can work easily with. And -- and he has taken him to Kandahar. He has indicated he's willing to go to Kandahar repeatedly for the Shuras as the Kandahar campaign gets underway. So I think that the -- that the day to day working relationship, certainly on the military side, and -- and between General McChrystal and President Karzai is -- is working well. And I think -- I think we frankly have to be sensitive in our own comments about President Karzai in terms of being mindful that he is the embodiment of sovereignty for Afghanistan also in the way we treat him. TAPPER: Secretary Gates, WikiLeaks recently released a video that showed U.S. troops killing some civilians in Iraq. I understand the fog of war, and I understand that -- that this was a very difficult situation. Does the release of that video, and the fact that that happened damage the image of the U.S. in the world? GATES: I don't think so. They're -- they're in a combat situation. The video doesn't show the broader picture of the -- of the firing that was going on at American troops. It's obviously a hard thing to see. It's painful to see, especially when you learn after the fact what was going on. But you -- you talked about the fog of war. These people were operating in split second situations. And, you know, we -- we've investigated it very thoroughly. And it's -- it's unfortunate. It's clearly not helpful. But by the same token, I think -- think it should not have any lasting consequences. TAPPER: Secretary Clinton. I -- I do want to ask you a couple of domestic questions. First of all, there was a Supreme Court opening. What advice would you give President Obama? CLINTON: Well I think President Obama is fully aware of this great responsibility and opportunity that Justice Stevens' retirement presents him. And as a former law professor, I know he is devoted to the Constitution. And understands the critical role that the court plays in so many areas of our -- our lives as Americans. And I'm confident that he's going nominate a highly qualified person. And I hope that there will be a smooth confirmation, because whoever the president nominates will be qualified to sit on the court. And I think it would be really reassuring for the country to see Republicans and Democrats working together to confirm a nominee as soon as possible. TAPPER: And lastly, healthcare reform. When you look at President Obama's success that he was able to get this done. Do you think, ""Oh, that's how you do it?"" Or do you think that the only way he was able to do it was because you and your husband stormed the castle first. And even if it didn't work, you laid the ground work for President Obama to help to be able to succeed? CLINTON: Jake, I don't think either of those things. I think thank goodness. Finally the United States is going to have a system that will begin to meet the needs of all of our people, reform our insurance industry which is long overdue. Begin to control costs, which is absolutely critical. And, you know, it's been a long time coming. It goes back many decades. And I think it's an extraordinary historical achievement. And I'm delighted to, you know, have -- have seen it come to pass. TAPPER: Secretary Clinton, Secretary Gates, thanks so much for joining us. GATES: Pleasure.

24171,So Much For Wise Latinas,"Ann Coulter Letter With the Supreme Courts decision in Ricci v. DeStefano this week, we can now report that Sonia Sotomayor is even crazier than Ruth Bader Ginsburg. To recap the famous Ricci case, in 2003, the city of New Haven threw out the results of a firefighters test  which had been expressly designed to be race-neutral  because only whites and Hispanics scored high enough to receive immediate promotions, whereas blacks who took the test did well enough only to be eligible for promotions down the line. Inasmuch as the high-scoring white and Hispanic firemen were denied promotions solely because of their race, they sued the city for race discrimination. Obamas Justice-designate Sotomayor threw out their lawsuit in a sneaky, unsigned opinion  the judicial equivalent of ""talk to the hand."" She upheld the citys race discrimination against white and Hispanic firemen on the grounds that the test had a ""disparate impact"" on blacks, meaning that it failed to promote some magical percentage of blacks. This strict quota regime was dressed up by the city  and by Sotomayors opinion  as a reasonable reaction to the threat of lawsuits by blacks who were not promoted. Thats a complicated way of saying: Racial quotas are peachy. According to Sotomayor, any test that gets the numbers wrong  whatever ""wrong"" means in any given context of professions, populations, applicants, workers, etc.  is grounds for a lawsuit, which in turn, is grounds for an employer to engage in race discrimination against disfavored racial groups, such as white men. Consequently, the only legal avenue available to employers under Sotomayors ruling is always to impose strict racial quotas in making hiring and promotion decisions. Say, if the threat of a lawsuit permits the government to ignore the Constitution, can pro-lifers get New Haven to shut down all abortion clinics by threatening to sue them? Theres no question but that abortion clinics have a ""disparate impact"" on black babies. This week, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 for the white and Hispanic firefighters, overturning Sotomayors endorsement of racial quotas. But all nine justices rejected Sotomayors holding that different test results alone give the government a green light to engage in race discrimination. Even Justice Ginsburgs opinion for the dissent clearly stated that ""an employer could not cast aside a selection method based on a statistical disparity alone."" Indeed, the dissenters argued that the case should be returned to the lower courts to look for some hidden racial bias in the test. For Sotomayor, the results alone proved racial bias. The one advantage Sotomayors talk-to-the-hand opinion has over Justice Ginsburgs prolix dissent is that brevity prevented Sotomayor from having to explain why quotas arent quotas. That was left to Ginsburg. Liberals desperately want race quotas  as long as quotas never come to their offices. But they cant say that, so instead they talk in circles for 10 hours straight, until everyone else is exhausted, and then, when no one is paying attention, they announce: So were all agreed  we will have racial quotas. Based on her lifetime of experience working as a firefighter, Ginsburg said: ""Relying heavily on written tests to select fire officers is a questionable practice, to say the least."" Liberals prefer a more objective test, such as race. Isnt excelling on written tests how Ruth Bader Ginsburg got where she is? Its curious how people whose entire careers are based on doing well on tests find them so irrelevant to other peoples jobs. In the middle of a fire, it can either be a great idea or the worst possible idea to open a door. An excellent method for finding out if your next fire chief knows the correct answer is a written test. Unleashing the canard of all race-obsessed liberals, Ginsburg observed that courts have found that a fire officers job ""involves complex behaviors, good interpersonal skills, the ability to make decisions under tremendous pressure, and a host of other abilities  none of which is easily measured by a written, multiple choice test."" So does a lawyers job. And yet attorneys with absolutely no ""interpersonal skills"" get cushy jobs and extravagant salaries on the basis of their commendable performance on all manner of written tests, from multiple choice LSATs and bar exams to written law school exams. I note that Ginsburg has not shown any particular interest in rectifying the ""disparate impact"" of legal exams: She never hired a single black law clerk out of the dozens she employed in more than a decade as an appeals court judge. (Her hiring practices on the Supreme Court are a state secret, but I can state with supreme certainty that her clerks do not reflect the racial mix of Washington, D.C.) But liberals think other peoples jobs are a joke, so the testing must also be a joke. That is  other than their preferred test: ""Is the applicant black, female or otherwise handicapped?"" There is no test that can prove all things about an employee and so there is no test that cant be derided by the race-mongers. Which is exactly the point. Get rid of all tests  except for lawyers who graduated at the top of their law school classes at Columbia, like Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Then liberals are free to impose racial quotas on other peoples jobs without limit. As crazy as this is, even Ginsburg and the other dissenters made a big point of pretending there was some flaw in this particular test. None adopted Sotomayors position that unequal test results alone prove discrimination. This suggests that a wise Jewish lady, due to the richness of her life experiences, might come to a better judgment than a Latina judge would.

2,Texas nonprofit has received $1.5 billion in federal money to run shelters for immigrant children,"A Southwest Key spokeswoman, Cindy Casares, has said the nonprofit is pleased with its overall record and takes action when a staff member isnt up to the job. In the last three years, Southwest Key UM shelter programs have been evaluated for compliance on 73,292 standards and we are proud to say that less than 1 percent of those resulted in a deficiency, she said in a written statement. However, we take each of the deficiencies seriously by self-reporting to invite external investigations as well as performing our own internal investigations. When called for, staff have been terminated or retrained as we continue to strive for excellence in the services we provide to the children entrusted to our care. One former Southwest Key employee has drawn national attention in the last week for his allegation that he had been ordered to separate three siblings who were hugging at a shelter for undocumented children in Arizona. Antar Davidson said the incident made him realize his time working with Southwest Key needed to end. I was told that they should not be able to hug, Davidson told CNN about the incident involving a girl and her two brothers. And [I] basically realized that being in Southwest Key ... despite the good I was doing, would mean that I had basically come up to doing things I felt were morally wrong.

20,How Trump Came to Enforce a Practice of Separating Migrant Families,"But Mr. Miller has expressed none of the presidents misgivings. No nation can have the policy that whole classes of people are immune from immigration law or enforcement, he said during an interview in his West Wing office this past week. It was a simple decision by the administration to have a zero tolerance policy for illegal entry, period. The message is that no one is exempt from immigration law. The administrations critics are not buying that explanation. This is not a zero tolerance policy, this is a zero humanity policy, and we cant let it go on, said Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon. Ripping children out of their parents arms to inflict harm on the child to influence the parents, he added, is unacceptable. Beyond those moral objections, Jeh C. Johnson, who as secretary of homeland security was the point man for the Obama administrations own struggles with illegal immigration, argued that deterrence, in and of itself, is neither practical nor a long-term solution to the problem. Ive seen this movie before, and I feel like what we are doing now, with the zero tolerance policy and separating parents and children for the purpose of deterrence, is banging our heads against the wall, he said. Whether its family detention, messaging about dangers of the journey, or messaging about separating families and zero tolerance, its always going to have at best a short-term reaction. And that view was based on hard experience. When Central American migrants, including many unaccompanied children, began surging across the border in early 2014, Mr. Obama, the antithesis of his impulsive successor, had his own characteristic reaction: He formed a multiagency team at the White House to figure out what should be done.",TRUE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/stephen-miller-descendant-asylum-seekers-fled-anti-semitic-violence/,Politics,Snopes

For weeks, the topic has dominated headlines and sparked what seems like coordinated outrage among liberals.

The Obama administration was appallingly lax at conducting even basic checks about the adults who showed up to claim migrant children. As detention centers became incapable of housing the massive influx of migrants, the [Obama-run] Department of Health and Human Services started placing children into the care of sponsors who would oversee the minors until their bids for refugee status could be reviewed, explained New York magazine, again confirming that the detention of child migrants took place long before Trump.

72,"Pressure Builds on HBO, Bill Maher After Host Uses Racial Slur on Real Time  Variety","Bill Maher apologized and HBO scolded him publicly. But will that be enough to quiet the storm over Mahers use of a racial slur during Fridays edition of Real Time with Bill Maher? Public outrage swelled following Fridays 10 p.m. live airing of Real Time with Bill Maher. HBO issued a statement Saturday calling the hosts use of the phrase Im a house n during an interview with Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse completely inexcusable and tasteless. HBO said the remark would be edited out of subsequent airings of the episode. Maher made the comment in jest after Sasse invited Maher to spend a day working in the fields of Nebraskas farms. Maher acknowledged that the N-word was offensive and said he regretted using it. Friday nights are always my worst night of sleep because Im up reflecting on the things I should or shouldnt have said on my live show. Last night was a particularly long night as I regret the word I used in the banter of a live moment, he said in a statement issued Saturday. By multiple accounts, HBO has no plans to take any action against Maher, who has been a mainstay at the network since 2003. A source noted that Maher has rarely offered any kind of mea culpa for provocative comments. Most recently, he stood firm in the face of harsh criticism for his decision to have the controversial blogger Milo Yiannopoulos, known for his racially charged online postings, as a guest on his show. The formal apology for using the N-word indicates that he recognizes that a line was crossed, something that was important to HBO. Related Bill Maher Apologizes for Using N-Word on HBOs Real Time HBO Calls Bill Mahers Use of N-Word Completely Inexcusable and Tasteless But the fury voiced on social media after Fridays airing stirred up examples of past statements from Maher about Muslims and the LGBTQ community that were widely deemed offensive. ThinkProgress, the editorial arm of the liberal Center for American Progress Action Fund, posted an article declaring Bill Maher has been a public racist for a long time with links to past clips from Real Time. The anger is an echo of the groundswell that led to the ouster in April of Bill OReilly, after the New York Times published an expose on sexual harassment allegations leveled at the Fox News host. It also has a parallel in Mahers past. Mahers ABC late-night show Politically Incorrect was axed after five years in June 2002 following Mahers observation that the U.S.s post-9/11 bombing campaigns against terrorist targets were cowardly acts. The comment sparked advertiser defections from the show  a pressure point that cant be used in the commercial-free environment of HBO. But at a moment of great political and cultural strife in the country, inflammatory statements and actions have been the undoing of numerous public figures. Just this past week, Kathy Griffin was forced to apologize amid a tidal wave of criticism from both the right and the left when she posed for a photo with a prop depicting President Trumps bloodied, severed head. Despite her apology, that stunt quickly cost Griffin her gig co-hosting CNNs New Years Eve coverage with Anderson Cooper. For Maher, another damaging video clip making the rounds on Saturday is an interview with comedian Wayne Brady from HuffPost Live in 2012, after Brady and Maher tangled over the latters assertion that Brady was a non-threatening black man. Brady said the comment indicates that Maher has a stereotypical view of black men as menacing. When I talk to you again, Ill give you that black dude and I will beat your ass in public, Brady said of Maher in 2012. Maher and Real Time have long been highly regarded in industry circles for the hosts willingness to confront thorny issues. The show earned consecutive Emmy noms for best talk-variety show from 2005 through 2014, and was nommed again in 2016. Reaction from viewers and industry insiders via social media to Mahers comment was, not surprisingly, fast and furious, and overwhelmingly negative. But Maher does have prominent supporters, such as author and Georgetown University professor Michael Eric Dyson. Dyson condemned Mahers use of the N-word but defended his record of offering a platform to an array of African-American perspectives on politics and culture. Given the Bill Maher I know, he will use this opportunity to strengthen his role as an ally to black people, Dyson wrote. Spike Lee, meanwhile, had mixed feelings about the comedian. Oh, him using the n-word? I think its problematic. Ill leave it at that, he told Variety at a Brooklyn event on Saturday. I like Bill Maher, but I dont know if he should have used the n-word.

On Tuesday, Mr Trump continued his war of words against Mr Trudeau, saying the Canadian leader's stance against the US would cost his Canada ""a lot of money"". Mr Trump had earlier posted a string of tweets attacking Mr Trudeau's personality just hours after leaving the divisive G7 summit in Quebec. ""[He] acted so meek and mild,"" he said. ""Very dishonest and weak."" Mr Trump's latest comments have elicited many apologies from Americans who disagree with his hard-line approach. Actor Robert De Niro, who was in Canada for a restaurant opening, apologised to a crowd for ""the idiotic behaviour of my president"". ""I apologise to Justin Trudeau and the other people at the G7,"" he said as the crowd cheered in Toronto. Even the city's mayor John Tory thanked the actor for his remarks. On social media #ThanksCanada was trending, as Americans online expressed their gratitude for their northern neighbour and distanced themselves from their president. Mr Trump's comments continue to provide fodder for columnists from some of Canada's top newspapers. ""The strongest bilateral relationship in the world is in a ditch and there's no clear way to get out,"" wrote Globe and Mail columnist Margaret Wente. ""Reasoning and logic won't help. You might as well try to reason with a two-tonne two-year old with a tantrum."" A columnist for La Presse, another French-language daily, said Canada's relationship with the US has never been so threatened in the country's modern history. ""Unlike those who preceded him in recent decades, Donald Trump is no friend to Canada,"" writes Alexandre Sirois. ""He does not wish us well."" In Maclean's magazine, columnist Scott Gilmore called on Canadians to hit Mr Trump ""where it hurts"" by boycotting his businesses. Mr Trump's insults even managed to unite Canada's political parties, spurring Mr Trudeau's political enemies leapt to his defence. On Monday, members of Parliament in Canada's House of Commons unanimously passed a motion in support of retaliatory measures against the US metals tariffs and to ""reject disparaging and ad hominem statements by US officials which do a disservice to bilateral relations and work against efforts to resolve this trade dispute"". The leader of Canada's opposition Conservative Party accused the US of ""divisive rhetoric and personal attacks"". Doug Ford, who was recently elected premier of Ontario, tweeted his support for Mr Trudeau. Jason Kenney, the leader of the United Conservative Party, and leader of the opposition in the province of Alberta, tweeted out an old clip of former president Ronald Reagan saying that America's peaceful allies ""are not our enemies"". Federal Green Party leader Elizabeth May said that all Canadian leaders should rally behind Mr Trudeau. The spat began shortly after the G7 summit concluded, when Mr Trudeau gave a press conference vowing retaliatory action next month over US tariffs on steel and aluminium. Mr Trump then unleashed a series of tweets personally attacking the Canadian PM. Those first tweets spurred most Canadian newspapers to run angry editorials denouncing Mr Trump. ""He sulked his way through the first part of the meeting, gave his delegation the OK to sign the summit's pallid final communiqu, then threw a hissy fit and tore it up,"" the Toronto Star said. ""It was both dishonest and amateurish."" The newspaper said Mr Trump ""chose to make up his own facts"" about tariffs and trade. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption White House adviser: ""There's a special place in hell for Justin Trudeau"" The Globe and Mail newspaper was equally strong, branding the spat ""one of the most flagrant manufactured crises ever perpetrated by an American administration against an ally"". ""Mr Trump set an antagonistic tone for the summit by announcing, just prior to it, steep tariffs on Canadian and European steel and aluminium,"" it said. French language daily Le Journal de Montreal said Mr Trudeau ""became the scapegoat of Donald Trump and his advisers"". Mr Trump kept up his rhetoric from Singapore, where he is attending a summit with North Korea's Kim Jong-un, condemning allies for the level of their payments towards Nato.",TRUE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/did-trudeau-say-worse-things-better-men/,Politics,Snopes
82,Trade war looms as Trump and adviser lob insults and accusations at Trudeau,"An all-out trade war looms as Donald Trump and his advisers lashed out at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for declaring Canada wont be pushed around by the U.S. President over the contentious tariff dispute on steel and aluminum. An infuriated Mr. Trump called the Prime Minister very dishonest and weak on Twitter Saturday, threatened to impose tariffs on automobiles and dispatched top aides to U.S. network shows on Sunday to lambaste Mr. Trudeau as a backstabber who deserved a special place in hell. In the wake of the confrontation, G7 leaders, Mr. Trudeaus political opponents at home and a number of U.S. politicians rallied around the Prime Minister Story continues below advertisement Mr. Trudeau avoided the media on Sunday, but Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters in Quebec City that Ottawa would not engage in a war of words with the Trump administration. Ms. Freeland spoke to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Sunday, and is expected to meet with him again on Wednesday in Washington. Canada does not conduct its diplomacy through ad hominem attacks. We dont think that that is a useful or productive way to do business, Ms. Freeland said. But she said that Ottawa wont be bullied and will hit back with $16-billion of retaliatory tariffs if the U.S. does not rescind its penalties on steel and aluminum imposed last week. Our retaliatory tariffs will come into effect  perfectly reciprocal, perfectly measured, a dollar-for-dollar response  on July 1, which is Canada Day, perhaps not inappropriate, she said.

Absolutely nothing Globe editorial: Donald Trump insults Canada, and tests its patience NAFTAs saga so far: A guide to trade, the talks and Trump Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement Mr. Trump continued his Twitter attacks Monday on the Prime Minister, saying that Justin acts hurt when called out. The U.S. President also claimed that Canada had bragged about making almost 100 Billion Dollars in Trade with the United States, while failing to specify what document he was citing. Mr. Trump also targeted the G7s trade efforts, tweeting Monday Fair trade is now to be called fool trade if it is not reciprocal, also saying Sorry, we cannot let our friends, or enemies, take advantage of us on trade anymore. We must put the American worker first! Mr. Trumps top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, told CNN on Sunday that the President was furious after he left the G7 summit early and learned that Mr. Trudeau had told a wrap-up news conference that Canada would not be pushed around. In an extraordinary assault on one of Americas closest allies, Mr. Kudlow accused the Prime Minister of betraying the U.S. President and making him look weak on the eve of the historic summit with North Korea. He really kind of stabbed us in the back, Mr. Kudlow said and emphasized that the President is not going to let a Canadian prime minister push him around.  He is not going to permit any show of weakness on a trip to negotiate with North Korea.  Kim must not see American weakness. Mr. Trudeau, along with other G7 leaders, had endorsed the Presidents gamble to denuclearize North Korea. Story continues below advertisement White House trade adviser Peter Navarro was even harsher, telling Fox News that there was a special place in hell for any foreign leader that engages in bad-faith diplomacy with Donald J. Trump and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out the door and that is what Justin Trudeau did. In his Saturday tweet, Mr. Trump threatened to impose the same stiff tariffs on automobile exports from Canada and Europe  which would cripple the Canadian auto industry. Mr. Trumps advisers warned that the North American free-trade deal was also in jeopardy. Based on Justins false statements at his news conference, and the fact that Canada is charging massive Tariffs to our U.S. farmers, workers and companies, I have instructed our U.S. Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the U.S. Market!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 9, 2018 PM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our @G7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that, US Tariffs were kind of insulting and he will not be pushed around. Very dishonest & weak. Our Tariffs are in response to his of 270% on dairy!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 9, 2018 That was one of the worst political miscalculations in Canadian history, Mr. Navarro said, while Mr. Kudlow added: How many times has the President said if you hit me, I will hit you back.  A senior Canadian official said that Mr. Trumps outburst came out of left field, since Mr. Trudeau had already announced reciprocal tariffs last week. Canada is uncertain whether the dispute could lead to a trade war and is particularly concerned if the U.S. imposes tariffs on Canadian autos, which the official said would be disastrous for both countries. Ms. Freeland brushed off the White House tirades and discounted the threat that NAFTA is dead. Mr. Trump said on Saturday that a deal was close on a sunset clause that would reopen NAFTA after five years, but Mr. Trudeau later refuted the President, saying Canada could never agree to that provision. A trade deal with a sunset clause is not a trade deal and therefore we will not accept a sunset clause of five, ten or whatever duration that is proposed by the President, Mr. Trudeau said. The U.S.-Canada rift erupted after Mr. Trump left the G7 summit to head to his much-anticipated meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. At a news conference, Mr. Trudeau condemned the Presidents steel and aluminum actions as destructive and even illegal. Mr. Trump was on Air Force One en route to that meeting in Singapore on Saturday when he fired off two blistering tweets. He ordered U.S. officials to pull out of a joint G7 communiqu that spoke about fair and balanced trade and told them to examine the imposition of tariffs on foreign automobiles coming into the U.S. market. PM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our @G7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that, US Tariffs were kind of insulting and he will not be pushed around.  Mr. Trump tweeted. The senior Canadian official said other G7 leaders have rallied behind Mr. Trudeau. Key U.S. politicians and Canadian political opponents are also backing the Prime Minister. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Mr. Trumps withdrawal from the G7 communiqu via Twitter is of course sobering and a little depressing  and warned that Europe will forge ahead with reciprocal tariffs like Canada. The office of French President Emmanuel Macron said: International co-operation cannot be dictated by fits of anger and throwaway remarks. U.S. Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein called Mr. Trumps outburst a big mistake, while Republican Senator John McCain said the Presidents behaviour toward his G7 allies was wrong. Appearing on Fox News on Sunday, former prime minister Stephen Harper urged Mr. Trump to stop picking trade fights with Canada and join forces to push China to open its markets. Us fighting over our trade relationship when the Chinese have a four-to-one imbalance with both of us is, in my judgment, just the wrong priority, he said. NDP MP Charlie Angus called Mr. Trump a small-minded man not fit for public office. Canada will not be pushed around by his circus-thug bluster. Incoming Ontario Conservative premier Doug Ford said he stood shoulder to shoulder with Mr. Trudeau as did Albertas United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney. Mr. Trump, who arrived late and left the G7 summit, in La Malbaie, Que., early, was unmoved by concerted efforts to persuade him to reverse his tariffs. He warned that Canadian and European reciprocal tariffs aimed at U.S. goods and services would be met with new levies. We are like the piggy bank that everyone is robbing and that ends, Mr. Trump told reporters on Saturday. Before departing for Singapore, Mr.Trump again called for Russia to be reinstated in the G7. Mr. Harper, who led the charge to oust Russia from the G7 in 2014 after its annexation of Crimea, said President Vladimir Putin should not be allowed back into an alliance of liberal democracies. This is a man who kills his political opponents. There is not a place around an allied table for a man like that, he said.

85,Trumps zero tolerance at the border is causing child shelters to fill up fast,"Families who illegally crossed the Mexico-U.S. border turn themselves in to U.S. Border Patrol agents near McAllen, Tex., on May 9. (Loren Elliott/Reuters) The number of migrant children held in U.S. government custody without their parents has surged 21 percent in the past month, according to the latest figures, an increase driven by the Trump administrations zero tolerance crackdown on families who cross the border illegally. Although the government has not disclosed how many children have been separated from their parents as a result of the new measures, the Department of Health and Human Services said Tuesday that it had 10,773 migrant children in its custody, up from 8,886 on April 29. Under the zero tolerance approach rolled out last month by Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, anyone who crosses into the United States illegally will face criminal prosecution. In most cases, that means parents who arrive with children stay in federal jails while their children are sent to HHS shelters. Those shelters are at 95 percent capacity, an HHS official said Tuesday, and the agency is preparing to add potentially thousands of new bed spaces in the coming weeks. HHS also is exploring the possibility of housing children on military bases but views the measure as a last option, according to the HHS official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the agencys preparations. HHS has about 1,300 reserve beds to accommodate more children, the official said, including several hundred at a government-owned building in Homestead, Fla., adjacent to an Air Force base previously used as a Labor Department training center. In a statement, Kenneth J. Wolfe, a spokesman for HHSs Administration for Children and Families, said that the agency has an existing network of approximately 100 shelters in 14 states and that additional temporary housing is only sought as a last resort when current locations are reaching capacity. The latest figures do not distinguish between minors who arrive without a parent and those who are separated from their mothers and fathers after they cross the border. But an official for U.S. Customs and Border Protection testified at a Senate committee hearing last week that 638 adults were referred for prosecution between May 6 and May 19 under the new zero-tolerance effort and that they brought 658 children with them. As the scope of the family- separation measures becomes clearer, President Trumps immigration advisers pushed back Tuesday at false or misleading stories about their policies that circulated widely on social media over the weekend. Many seized on reports that HHS lost 1,475 children last year, describing them as missing. But those reports were based on misleading characterizations of a follow-up phone survey conducted by HHS when it attempted to reach the adult sponsors of migrant children 30 days after releasing them to the sponsors. HHS does not have a formal responsibility to track children once they are released to sponsors. Agency officials say that is the immigration court systems job. And because many adult sponsors, including parents, are living in the country illegally, they may fear contact with federal officials. In the last fiscal year, in 14 percent of those calls, the family didnt answer the phone, a top HHS official, Steven Wagner, told reporters Tuesday. But theres no reason to believe that anything has happened to the kids. If you call a friend and they dont answer the phone, you dont assume that theyve been kidnapped. Trump officials also gave new details Tuesday about an agreement between HHS and the Department of Homeland Security that immigrant advocates warn could further increase the number of children in federal custody and how long they stay there. The agreement will give Homeland Security more access to the personal information of parents, relatives or other adult sponsors seeking custody of the children. In the past, that information was largely walled off for the purposes of immigration enforcement while the sponsors were vetted by HHS, out of a concern that Homeland Securitys involvement could have a chilling effect on parents living in the country illegally and discourage them from claiming the kids. But under Trump, senior officials at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have recommended such measures to deter parents from attempting to send for their children while knowing they can get custody with little fear of deportation. Wendy Young, president of the advocacy group Kids in Need of Defense, said Homeland Security is injecting a law enforcement approach into this system, one that will strain HHS bed space. Homeland Security officials declined to say Tuesday whether the information will be used to target parents for arrest and deportation, characterizing the new measures as an effort to protect children. If somebody is unwilling to claim their child from custody because theyre concerned about their own immigration status, I think that de facto calls into question whether theyre an adequate sponsor and whether we should be releasing a child to that person, Wagner said. Plus, we have the problem of people fraudulently claiming to be parents when, in fact, theyre not, he added, saying the agreement would give the agency better tools to check sponsors backgrounds and verify their identities. In recent months, the average time children spent at HHS shelters increased from 51 to 56 days, according to the agencys latest statistics. Last year, HHS took custody of more than 40,000 migrant children, and the agencys Office of Refugee Resettlement said it released 93 percent to adult sponsors. In half of those cases, the adult sponsor was one of the childs parents, and another 40 percent were close adult relatives. Jonathan Rath Hoffman, chief spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, described the Trump administrations determination to prosecute parents as a continuation of Obama-era measures. This policy has not changed from the prior administration, he said. In 2016, more than 20 percent of those who crossed the border illegally faced criminal charges, according to Homeland Security data. During President Barack Obamas second term, the government prosecuted roughly 70,000 cases per year. Those figures do not indicate how many arrived with children. Trump critics say that claim is specious and obfuscates the current administrations break with standard practice. Whats happened is the exception to the rule is now becoming the rule, said Young, who said prosecutions under Obama were far more selective. Here theyre doing zero-tolerance policy to punish families and send a message to their home countries: Dont do this. Its so disingenuous to couch this as a continuation of Obamas policies, Young said. This is the most aggressive response to Central American migration weve seen to date. Trump has lashed out at Nielsen and other aides because the number of people illegally crossing the Mexican border has spiked, robbing his ability to campaign on promises of improved border security. White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly first floated the idea of separating families last year, calling it a tool to discourage migrants from attempting the journey. More recently, he caused an uproar when he appeared to dismiss experts warnings that separating children from their parents inflicts emotional and psychological damage to the kids, saying theyll be taken care of  put into foster care or whatever. In a tweet Saturday, Trump portrayed the family-separation measures as a tactic to arm-twist his opponents. Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there [sic] parents once they cross the Border into the U.S., he wrote. Trump called the practice horrible, so if he thinks its so horrible he ought to end it and not make children pawns as a negotiating tool, said Lee Gelernt, an immigration attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, which has filed a class-action lawsuit to force the government to stop separating families at the border. Little kids are begging and screaming not to be taken from parents, and theyre hauled off, Gelernt said. Parents are telling their older kids, Be brave, be brave.

102,Georgia Congressman berated for tweeting D-Day photo with Nazi soldiers,"Georgia Congressman Drew Ferguson was lambasted on social media Wednesday after his campaign tweeted a D-Day photo that depicted Nazi soldiers rather than American troops. The West Point Republicans campaign tweeted the black-and-white picture shortly before 7 a.m., which included the soldiers in front of a tank that featured the Iron Cross, a German military symbol. The heroism of our own troops  was matched by that of the armed forces of the nations that fought by our side  they absorbed the blows  and they shared to the full in the ultimate destruction of the enemy, the first-term congressman tweeted, quoting President Harry Truman. The posting was deleted shortly after a top staffer from the progressive super PAC American Bridge, which bills itself as holding Republicans accountable, replied that the troops were Nazi solders. Ferguson spokesman Dan McLagan said the image was selected by an intern at a digital media company that works with the congressmans campaign. As a patriot and the father of a daughter serving in the Navy, Drew is pretty furious about it, McLagan said in an e-mail. We deleted the post immediately but the sentiment of heartfelt gratitude and reverence for the men who charged into withering fire on those beaches 74 years ago can never be erased from our hearts. Members of Congress frequently employ staff members to handle their social media accounts  especially younger aides who might not immediately recognize the outward curve of the German helmets. But the gaffe still stings given that events such as D-Day and Pearl Harbor remain important cultural and historical markers, especially among older voters. Theres also a tinge of irony. Fergusons 3rd Congressional District is home to Newnan, the quiet community which was the site of a neo-Nazi rally in April. Turnout for the event, organized by a Detroit-based fascist organization, was small, our colleagues reported at the time. Ferguson condemned the rally. Every citizen has the constitutional right to express their First Amendment freedoms to free speech and protest, but the racist views of neo-Nazis are completely abhorrent, he said ahead of the event.

113,Congressional Candidate In Virginia Admits Hes A Pedophile,"Nathan Larson, a 37-year-old accountant from Charlottesville, Virginia, is running for Congress as an independent candidate in his native state. He is also a pedophile, as he admitted to HuffPost on Thursday, who has bragged in website posts about raping his late ex-wife. In a phone call, Larson confirmed that he created the now-defunct websites suiped.org and incelocalypse.today  chat rooms that served as gathering places for pedophiles and violence-minded misogynists like himself. HuffPost contacted Larson after confirming that his campaign website shared an IP address with these forums, among others. His sites were terminated by their domain host on Tuesday. On the phone, he was open about his pedophilia and seemingly unfazed about his long odds of attaining government office. A lot of people are tired of political correctness and being constrained by it, he said. People prefer when theres an outsider who doesnt have anything to lose and is willing to say whats on a lot of peoples minds. When asked whether hes a pedophile or just writes about pedophilia, he said, Its a mix of both. When people go over the top theres a grain of truth to what they say. Asked whether there was a grain of truth in his essay about father-daughter incest and another about raping his ex-wife repeatedly, he said yes, offering that plenty of women have rape fantasies. NathanLarsonorg Nathan Larson is running for Congress as an independent in Virginia. In an interview with HuffPost, he was open about his pedophilia. According to Larsons campaign manifesto, his platform as a quasi-neoreactionary libertarian candidate includes protecting gun ownership rights, establishing free trade and protecting benevolent white supremacy, as well as legalizing incestuous marriage and child pornography. In the manifesto, Larson called Nazi leader Adolf Hitler a white supremacist hero. He urged Congress to repeal the Violence Against Women Act, adding, We need to switch to a system that classifies women as property, initially of their fathers and later of their husbands. He also showed sympathy for men who identify as involuntary celibates, or incels, suggesting it is unfair that they are forced to pay taxes for schools, welfare, and other support for other mens children. Using the pseudonyms Leucosticte and Lysander, Larson frequently participated in conversations on his own message boards, he confirmed to HuffPost. suiped org Larson posted as ""Lysander"" on his now-defunct website, suiped.org. As Lysander on suiped.org, a forum for suicidal pedophiles, Larson wrote numerous posts endorsing child rape and other forms of sexual abuse. Why doesnt every pedo just focus on making money so they can get a pedo-wife and then either impregnate her with some fucktoys or adopt some fucktoys? he wrote on the platform in October. That would accommodate both those who are and arent into incest. And of course, the adoption process lets you pick a boy or a girl. Larson has a 3-year-old daughter who lives with relatives. He told HuffPost that he relinquished his parental rights during a custody battle. His ex-wife got a court-ordered restraining order against him in 2015 before she died by suicide. He has since remarried, he says, and is now living in Catlett, Virginia. Larson used the moniker Leucosticte on incelocalypse.today  a forum for incels who are pedophiles that was removed this week after the website Babe contacted the domain host. There, he identified as a hebephilic rapist, noting that hes not a typical incel because hed had sex by raping his ex-wife. According to the site, which HuffPost viewed before it was taken down, incelocalypse refers to the day we make the jailbaits our rape-slaves. (The term jailbait is slang for a person who is under the legal age of consent for sex.) incelocalypse today Larson posted as ""Leucosticte"" on incelocalypse.today. HuffPost did not view any posts explicitly stating that he has engaged in sexual activity with minors, although he repeatedly expressed a desire to have sex with infants and children, including his own daughter. In the phone call, Larson said that the word pedophile is vague and just a label, adding that its normal for men to be attracted to underage women. He said he did not commit any crimes. In a 3,300-word essay on incelocalypse.today, titled Heres How to Psyche Yourself Up to Feel Entitled to Rape, Larson tells other members: Dont forget: feminism is the problem, and rape is the solution. On the platform, he also advocated for father-daughter marriage, killing women and raping virgins. Larson is less worried about his run for Congress than about his sites coming down. He told HuffPost that the termination of his websites is an affront to his freedom of speech and that hes going to try to get them hosted elsewhere. Not that itll matter  there are still plenty of forums where incels and other such communities can congregate. The removal of Larsons sites caused an uproar on incels.me, a separate, much larger forum for incels. Larsons political ambitions span more than a decade. He first ran for Congress in Virginias 1st District in 2008 on what he described as an anarcho-capitalist platform. That same year, he sent a letter to the Secret Service threatening to kill the president, which landed him in federal prison for 14 months and barred him from seeking public office in Virginia (convicted felons are free to run for federal office). But in 2016, then-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) restored voting and other civil rights to thousands of felons, allowing Larson to run for state office. In 2017 he ran in Virginias House of Delegates District 31 and secured less than 2 percent of the vote. Now he is gunning for a seat in Virginias 10th Congressional District.

0,Israel upholds use of surveillance technology on protesters,"JERUSALEM (AP) ��� Israel���s attorney general has upheld the Shin Bet security agency���s use of mobile-phone tracking technology to monitor and threaten Palestinian protesters at Jerusalem���s most sensitive holy site last year.

The decision, which came on Tuesday, drew harsh criticism from the civil rights group that challenged the use of the technology. The group warned that it would have a ���chilling effect��� on the country���s Arab minority.

The attorney general���s move was in response to a complaint over a series of text messages sent out last May to hundreds of Palestinians at the height of one of the city���s most turbulent periods in years. At the time, Palestinian protesters were clashing with Israeli police at the Al Aqsa Mosque in violence that helped spark an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip.

Using its tracking technology, the Shin Bet sent a text message to people who were determined to be in the area of the clashes and told them ���we will hold you accountable��� for acts of violence.

The recipients included both Palestinian residents of east Jerusalem, as well as Palestinian citizens of Israel. While some recipients had participated in the clashes, many others, such as people who lived, worked or prayed in the area, received the message erroneously and said they were surprised or scared by the message.

The Association for Civil Rights in Israel, a civil-society group, filed a complaint to the office of Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, urging him to halt the use of the technology. It cited the use of the tool on a large group of people and the threatening language of the text.

In its response, the attorney general���s office acknowledged there had been problems with the message, both with its language and because the mass distribution included unintended targets. But it said the use of the technology was a legitimate security tool and that the security service has revised its procedures to avoid similar mistakes in the future.

���After discussions with us on this subject, lessons were learned in the security agency and guidelines formulated in various aspects with the goal of preventing a recurrence of problems like this,��� said the opinion. It said the office planned no further intervention in the matter.

Tuesday was the final day of Mandelblit���s six-year term. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel, or ACRI, expressed disappointment with the ruling.

���They say they have the authority to continue sending these kind of texts to people,��� said Gil Gan-Mor, who heads the group���s unit on human rights in the digital age. ���We think differently.���

He said authorities have tools to investigate and prosecute people suspected in violence, but sending threatening messages was not the way to maintain security.

���Obviously this will have a chilling effect, to say the least, on practicing legitimate activities, like going to a protest or going to pray somewhere,��� he said. The group was studying the decision and would decide in the coming days whether to file an appeal to the Israeli Supreme Court, he added.

ACRI has previously filed legal challenges to the government���s use of the same Shin Bet tracking technology as a contact-tracing tool to prevent the spread of the coronavirus early in the pandemic.

Israel���s Supreme Court eventually restricted the use of the tool to specific cases, and studies have found that it was largely ineffective in identifying people with COVID-19.",TRUE,https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-technology-health-middle-east-jerusalem-add10954e1bd38eb68c3d7a7c276d48d,Politics,AP

0,Minneapolis Announces Plan To Replace Police Officers With Thousands Of Heavily Armed Social Workers,"MINNEAPOLIS���In an effort to regain the community���s trust and better allocate city resources, Mayor Jacob Frey announced Thursday that Minneapolis would dismantle its current police force and replace it with a new bureau of heavily armed social workers, effective immediately.

The mayor outlined a plan that dramatically restructured the municipality���s approach to public safety, replacing its nearly 850 police officers with a similar number of social workers, who would be dispatched to city streets and have at their disposal firearms, bulletproof vests, tear gas, armored vehicles with gun turrets, and other tools to enhance their service to the community.

���Minneapolis has demanded a new model of security, and so today we are reallocating the police department���s entire $193 million budget to clinical social workers, case managers, and crisis counselors,��� said Frey, confirming members of the newly created bureau would be issued service weapons and assigned to one of several precincts, the heads of which would report to a chief of social work. ���Why continue asking police to manage this city���s homelessness crisis, for example, when we can send in social workers���those actually trained in assisting housing-insecure people���to bulldoze our homeless camps and move the inhabitants out at gunpoint?���

���We have heard your call,��� Frey added, ���and rest-assured: The next time you contact the authorities, a licensed professional equipped with empathy, emotional intelligence, active listening skills, and a whole lot of firepower will be headed your way.���

Training for the new bureau reportedly includes instruction not only with Glock 20s and Colt M4 Carbines but also in takedown maneuvers, chokeholds, and baton techniques, all with the goal of enabling social workers to subdue any adversary encountered while conducting routine domestic checks, meeting with trauma survivors, or visiting a child welfare agency.

Recruits to the bureau acknowledged their work should be easier now that they have the capacity to immediately neutralize every potential threat in their path.

���As a substance abuse counselor, it���s nice to know that if one of my clients starts using again, I can just Taser them and confiscate their stash,��� said 47-year-old Cindy Hughes, who holds a master of social work degree from the College of St. Scholastica in Duluth and, in addition to a stun gun and sidearm, carries a Remington 700 sniper rifle in the trunk of her squad car. ���It���s so much easier than getting them to go to a meeting.���

���Usually, if I���m worried they���re trying to score, we discuss sober-living facilities and ways to avoid common relapse triggers,��� Hughes continued. ���Now I can make extra sure they stay off the streets by simply handcuffing them to their bunk at the halfway house.���

According to Mayor Frey, out-of-work former police officers would be eligible to join the social work bureau so long as they earned the appropriate credentials, which would allow them to bring their confrontational impulses and intimidation tactics into both outpatient behavioral health centers and foster care settings.

City officials said they also planned to disband the Minneapolis Police Canine Unit and replace it with a team of local therapy dogs, which would be trained extensively in clamping their jaws onto people���s legs and ripping apart their flesh.

Sheila Bickford, a family therapist in the city for the past 30 years, told reporters her words would carry more weight now that she could enter counseling sessions outfitted with body armor, a ballistic helmet, a riot shield, and a shotgun loaded with less-lethal rounds.

���You definitely get people���s attention when you touch down in front of their home in the Child and Family Services chopper,��� said Bickford, referring to her division���s UH-60 Black Hawk military surplus helicopter. ���They can either listen when I tell them codependency takes a toll on the well-being and quality of your relationships, or they can get knocked down and kicked in the head until they are completely unresponsive. It���s the easy way or the hard way.���

0,Historians Find Evidence Of Nation���s Founding Lobbyists��� Campaign To Influence Constitution,"WASHINGTON���Drawing on a trove of letters, diaries, and itemized receipts recently donated by private collectors, historians from Georgetown University published new evidence on Wednesday of the Founding Lobbyists��� intense behind-the-scenes campaign to influence the U.S. Constitution.

The documents reveal a concerted effort by America���s earliest corporate power brokers to curry favor with the Constitution���s framers during the 1787 Constitutional Convention all the way through the ratification of the Bill of Rights in 1791, with delegates having been pampered with gifts such as expensive pocket watches, casks of fine Caribbean molasses, and extravagant quail-hunting trips to the Province of Massachusetts Bay.

���It���s now becoming clear just how much the final language of the Constitution was shaped by, say, complimentary jugs of quality mead or all-expenses-paid gambling jaunts aboard company-owned schooners.���

���What we���ve learned is that these men���acting on behalf of cotton, barrel, and livestock interests, among many others���played a pivotal role in crafting the Constitution as we know it,��� said professor J. Wilson Adler, noting that, for example, the Third Amendment barring the nonconsensual quartering of soldiers was only added after James Madison was treated to a feast of succulent brisket and stewed pumpkin care of the powerful boardinghouse industry. ���For all the Founding Fathers��� brilliance and vision, it���s now becoming clear just how much the final language of the Constitution was shaped by, say, complimentary jugs of quality mead or all-expenses-paid gambling jaunts aboard company-owned schooners.���

���These lobbyists knew full well that if you wanted first-rate treatment for your patrons in Providence or Charleston, you made sure that gilded ivory walking canes found their way to the delegates gathered in Philadelphia,��� he added.

Evidence also suggests that the original lobbyists were skilled in dampening opposition to their clients��� agendas. Recovered ledgers revealed that an early attempt at universal healthcare���via a welfare clause in Article IV���was voted down after an advocate for the Apothecaries Guild procured front-row duel tickets for the entire Pennsylvania delegation.According to witness accounts of the time, the Constitution���s authors were regularly spotted in the colonies��� most exclusive taverns, where a different member of the wax or beaver pelt lobbies would cover their exorbitant three-figure tabs and lavish them with exquisite silk garments and spices from beyond the Orient. Preserved woodcuts depict a number of Founding Fathers relaxing on the palm-lined beaches of Hispaniola as they and their families enjoyed luxury accommodations courtesy of the sugarcane industry.

In addition, personal letters from Thomas Paine and John Adams credit the introduction of the Second Amendment to representatives of the Musket Manufacturers Association, which funded a series of vicious attack broadsheets targeting anyone who spoke out against it, accusing critics of being tyrannical monarchists who harbored a secret plot to seize the colonies��� flintlocks.

���Of course, the grandiose spending and backroom deals at the Constitutional Convention did lead to some scandals, like Benjamin Franklin being arrested in a courtesan house with a saddlebag of pure snuff that had been provided by tobacco growers,��� said Adler, adding that there was also widespread public outcry following revelations that the Slave Traders of America had donated ���1,500 prize hogs and 250 stout men of West African stock��� to certain delegates in exchange for an abolition amendment being dropped. ���Despite these unseemly episodes, Founding Fathers like William Livingston and Gouverneur Morris actually went on to become Founding Lobbyists themselves, using their insider knowledge to command thousands of gold guineas from the blacksmith and whale oil industries.���

0,Biden orders release of Trump White House logs to Congress,"WASHINGTON (AP) ��� President Joe Biden is ordering the release of Trump White House visitor logs to the House committee investigating the riot of Jan. 6, 2021, once more rejecting former President Donald Trump���s claims of executive privilege.

The committee has sought a trove of data from the National Archives, including presidential records that Trump had fought to keep private. The records being released to Congress are visitor logs showing appointment information for individuals who were allowed to enter the White House on the day of the insurrection.

In a letter sent Monday to the National Archives, White House counsel Dana Remus said Biden had considered Trump���s claim that because he was president at the time of the attack on the U.S. Capitol, the records should remain private, but decided that it was ���not in the best interest of the United States��� to do so.

She also noted that as a matter of policy, the Biden administration ���voluntarily discloses such visitor logs on a monthly basis,��� as did the Obama administration, and that the majority of the entries over which Trump asserted the claim would be publicly released under the current policy.

A Trump spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the decision.

The Presidential Records Act mandates that records made by a sitting president and his staff be preserved in the National Archives, and an outgoing president is responsible for turning over documents to the agency when leaving office. Trump tried but failed to withhold White House documents from the House committee in a dispute that was decided by the Supreme Court.

Biden has already made clear that he is not invoking executive privilege concerning the congressional investigation unless he absolutely must. Biden has waived that privilege for much other information requested by the committee, which is going through the material and obtaining documents and testimony from witnesses, including some uncooperative ones.

The committee is focused on Trump���s actions from Jan. 6, when he waited hours to tell his supporters to stop the violence and leave the Capitol. Investigators are also interested in the organization and financing of a Washington rally the morning of the riot, when Trump told supporters to ���fight like hell.��� Among the unanswered questions is how close organizers of the rally coordinated with White House officials.

Investigators also are seeking communications between the National Archives and Trump���s aides about 15 boxes of records that the agency recovered from Trump at his Florida resort and are trying to learn what they contained.

Meanwhile, White House call logs obtained so far by the House committee do not list calls made by Trump as he watched the violence unfold on television on Jan. 6, nor do they list calls made directly to the president.

That lack of information about Trump���s personal calls is a particular challenge as the investigators work to discern what the then-president was doing in the White House as supporters violently beat police, broke into the Capitol and interrupted the congressional certification of Democrat Joe Biden���s election victory.

There are several possible explanations for omissions in the records, which do not reflect conversations that Trump had on Jan. 6 with multiple Republican lawmakers, for example. Trump was known to use a personal cell phone or he could have had a phone passed to him by an aide. The committee is also continuing to receive records from the National Archives and other sources, which could produce additional information.",TRUE,https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-united-states-congress-dana-remus-833698eba6e222cdc3dfa128c44b0c99,Politics,AP
0,Jan. 6 panel subpoenas 6 more in fake GOP electors scheme,"WASHINGTON (AP) ��� The House committee investigating the U.S. Capitol insurrection subpoenaed six more people Tuesday, including former Trump campaign members and state lawmakers, as it further expands its review into efforts to falsely declare Donald Trump the winner of the 2020 election in several swing states.

The panel is seeking testimony and records from individuals who it says had knowledge of or participated in efforts to send false ���alternate electors��� from seven of the states President Joe Biden rightfully won.

���The Select Committee is seeking information about efforts to send false slates of electors to Washington and change the outcome of the 2020 election,��� Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, the committee���s Democratic chairman, said in a statement. ���We���re seeking records and testimony from former campaign officials and other individuals in various states who we believe have relevant information about the planning and implementation of those plans.���

The individuals subpoenaed include Michael Roman and Gary Michael Brown, who served as directors for Trump���s 2020 reelection campaign. The committee believes the two men reportedly promoted allegations of election fraud as well as encouraged state legislators to appoint false slates of electors.

The other four individuals are Pennsylvania State Sen. Douglas Mastriano, Laura Cox, the former chair of the Michigan Republican Party, Arizona State Rep. Mark Finchem and Arizona Republican Party chair Kelli Ward.

Messages requesting comment from Ward, Mastriano, Roman and Finchem were not immediately returned.

Two weeks ago, Ward and her husband filed a lawsuit against the House committee seeking to block a subpoena of their phone records. They were presidential electors who would have voted for Trump in the Electoral College had he won Arizona. Both signed a document falsely claiming they were Arizona���s true electors, despite Democrat Biden���s victory in the state. No decisions have been issued in the case.

Mastriano, a former Army officer currently seeking Pennsylvania���s Republican gubernatorial nomination, was among Trump���s most dedicated supporters during the 2020 campaign, helping organize and host a four-hour hearing post-election that was attended by Rudy Giuliani and that Trump addressed remotely.

Finchem was on Capitol grounds on Jan. 6, although he did not enter the building. He has been a vocal critic of the election results in Arizona, contending despite evidence to the contrary that Trump won in Arizona.

He is currently pushing a resolution in the state Legislature that seeks to overturn the state���s certification of the 2020 presidential election, listing a slew of debunked election fraud conspiracy theories. He is also seeking the Republican nomination to run for secretary of state, Arizona���s chief election officer.

The latest subpoenas come more than a month after the committee issued subpoenas to 14 people over the submission of false Electoral College certificates declaring Trump the winner of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

0,Senate confirms Biden���s FDA pick despite political divisions,"WASHINGTON (AP) ��� The Senate narrowly confirmed President Joe Biden���s pick to lead the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday pushing past a thicket of political controversies that threatened to derail what was initially expected to be an easy confirmation.

The 50-46 vote means Dr. Robert Califf, a cardiologist and prominent medical researcher, will again lead the powerful regulatory agency, which he briefly headed during the end of President Barack Obama���s administration.

The FDA hasn���t had a permanent leader in more than a year despite playing a central role in the COVID-19 response effort, reviewing the vaccines, drugs and tests used to fight the pandemic.

The razor-thin vote underscores the increasing political polarization around the health care issues FDA oversees and contrasts with Califf���s overwhelming support just six years ago. The Senate previously confirmed him to the job by a vote of 89-4.

Califf now inherits a raft of decisions pending at the agency, which regulates products that make up an estimated one fifth of all U.S. consumer spending, including prescription and over-the-counter drugs, medical devices, tobacco products and most foods.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration is ���thrilled��� that the Senate confirmed Califf on a bipartisan basis.

���He brings to this critical post a lifetime of knowledge and the institutional experience that will ensure he hits the ground running,��� she said.

Califf���s to-do list includes specific commitments he���s made to Senate lawmakers to clinch the job. In particular, he has vowed to quickly launch a comprehensive review of opioid painkillers like OxyContin, which helped trigger the worst drug epidemic in U.S. history after their FDA approval in the 1990s.

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., urged senators to oppose Califf, saying he bears ���a great deal of responsibility��� for many of the drug overdose deaths that have occurred in the years since his first stint as FDA commissioner. During his 11-month tenure, Califf added new warning labels to opioids and commissioned outside recommendations on how to tighten regulation of the drugs. But he was replaced by President Donald Trump before implementing any major changes.

���Nothing that Dr. Califf has said or done has led me to believe he will operate the FDA any differently than he did during his previous tenure,��� said Manchin, whose home state has been ravaged by the opioid epidemic for nearly 30 years. Four other lawmakers from hard-hit blue states also voted against Califf.

The White House long assumed enough Republicans would support Califf to easily overcome any Democratic defections, given his strong support from pharmaceutical companies and patient groups.

But anti-abortion advocates recently launched a campaign to sink his Senate vote, outraged by a recent FDA decision that eased access to abortion pills. Groups including the Susan B. Anthony List and Students for Life of America threatened to pull support from any Republican senators supporting Califf.

In the end, six Republicans joined with all but five Democrats in voting to confirm Califf. Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., advocated for Califf on the Senate floor, saying that he had not seen someone with such a short previous stint at the FDA who ���accomplished anything, much less the many negatives that have been raised.���

���He has the robust agency and private sector experience needed to help build on the success of the FDA in helping Americans get back to normal life with the approval of tests, vaccines and therapeutics that are bringing the pandemic to an end,��� Burr added. ���He���s the leader we need today, but also for the future.���

Dr. Janet Woodcock, the FDA���s longtime drug center director, had been serving as acting commissioner since last January. She announced Tuesday via Twitter that she would continue working at the agency as a principal deputy commissioner.

More than a year after authorizing the first COVID-19 vaccines, the FDA still faces several key decisions, including whether to expand their use to children younger than 5. Last week the FDA unexpectedly delayed its timeline for reviewing Pfizer���s vaccine for that age group.

FDA commissioners aren���t typically involved in day-to-day scientific reviews, but they serve as the go-between for the agency���s scientists and the White House. That relationship has strained over the past year as Biden���s COVID-19 task force has repeatedly gotten out ahead of the FDA���s methodical, scientific reviews.

Califf will also need to replace the head of the FDA���s tobacco center, which is weighing whether to ban e-cigarettes from Juul, Reynolds American and other vaping companies due to their use by teens. FDA tobacco���s longtime director, Mitch Zeller, is set to retire this spring.

The FDA is also crafting new regulations to ban menthol cigarettes, a long-sought goal for many Democratic lawmakers and public health advocates.

Califf has publicly championed the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives by embracing FDA���s authority to ban certain tobacco products and ingredients. Though the FDA has had those powers for more than a decade, its efforts to regulate both traditional cigarettes and e-cigarettes have been stymied by industry lawsuits.

Califf first came to the FDA after more than 35 years at Duke University, where he founded a contract research organization that conducts studies for many of the world���s largest drugmakers.

Since leaving government he has worked as a health policy adviser for Google and served as a board director or adviser to more than a half-dozen drug and biotech companies. In keeping with federal procedure, Califf agreed to resign from all of those positions and sell off investments in FDA-regulated companies, according to his ethics disclosures form.",TRUE,https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-business-health-barack-obama-robert-califf-7602db3a1196dda90d6745d0b1002c9c,Politics,AP
0,US approves new headlights that won���t blind oncoming drivers,"DETROIT (AP) ��� Anyone who has ever been temporarily blinded by high-beam headlights from an oncoming car will be happy to hear this.

U.S. highway safety regulators are about to allow new high-tech headlights that can automatically tailor beams so they focus on dark areas of the road and don���t create glare for oncoming drivers.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says it issued a final rule allowing what���s called ���adaptive driving beam headlights��� on new vehicles. It will go into effect when published in the Federal Register in the next few days.

The headlights, commonly used in Europe, have LED lamps that can focus beams on darkness such as the driver���s lane and areas along the roadside. They also lower the intensity of the light beams if there���s oncoming traffic. Camera sensors and computers help determine where the light should go.

���This final rule will improve safety for pedestrians and bicyclists by making them more visible at night, and will help prevent crashes by better illuminating animals and objects in and along the road,��� the agency said in a news release on Tuesday.

The new rule, which was supported by the auto industry, comes as the safety agency grapples with a dramatic rise in traffic deaths nationwide.

The number of U.S. traffic deaths surged in the first nine months of 2021 to 31,720, the government reported Tuesday, keeping up a record pace of increased dangerous driving during the coronavirus pandemic.

The estimated figure of people dying in motor vehicle crashes from January to September 2021 was 12% higher than the same period in 2020. That represents the highest percentage increase over a nine-month period since the Transportation Department began recording fatal crash data in 1975.

The tally of 31,720 deaths was the highest nine-month figure since 2006.

Sam Abuelsamid, principal mobility analyst for Guidehouse Research, said the new lights will show up in higher-cost luxury vehicles at first, but will spread to more mainstram vehicles as the price of the technology falls.

Currently Audi charges $3,000 for the top version of the lights in the U.S. on its e-tron Sportback electric vehicle. The adaptive beam lights are offered on most Audi models in the U.S., but until now, could not be used. An Audi spokesman says the company is evaluating whether the lights meet NHTSA standards and whether they can be activated in the future.

The technology uses an array of light emitting diodes that can change where light beams are sent, rather than the current technology of high beams hitting everywhere. ���You have the ability to basically create a light pattern on the fly that is optimized for real-time conditions,��� Abuelsamid said. ���You can cast the light where it���s most useful.���

The new lights also will help partially automated driver assist systems keep cars in their lanes and avoid objects in front of the vehicles at night, Abuelsamid said.

The new lighting regulation also comes more than 1 1/2 years ahead of a requirement in the bipartisan infrastructure law passed by Congress last year, NHTSA said.

In the past the agency has moved slowly on safety measures mandated by Congress. An Associated Press review last year of NHTSA���s rule-making activities under the last three presidents found at least 13 auto safety rules that are years overdue based on deadlines set in laws passed by Congress.

0,BREAKING: War With Iran Imminent; President Trump Reinstates Military Draft,"WASHINGTON, D.C. ���

Earlier this week, President Trump illegally ordered the assassination of a top military general in Iran, Qasem Soleimani, prompting Iran to promise a swift revenge. In the imminent face of war with a powerful military in Iran, President Trump reinstated the United States draft, last used during the Vietnam Conflict.

���There are a lot of incredible, selfless American men and women who have been serving in the armed forces, some for many years, some still in basic training,��� stated President Trump early this morning from the Oval Office. ���These people, they need help. They need a lot of really, really big help, and we need to make sure they receive it. Reinstating the United States draft process is the easiest, and most logical answer.���

The draft process, which chooses young, American men at random to enlist in the armed forces, is something most people thought they would never see used again, but military officials agree with Trump that it���s the most efficient way to quickly build our military forces in the face of danger.

���When you anger another country by committing a blatant and completely illegal war crime, such as the case with our President���s attack in Iran, things heat up quickly, and action must be taken,��� said Secretary of Defense Mark Esper. ���We are ready to have our young men suit up and join our military forces, and the reinstatement of the draft will help immensely.���

���It���s about time these lazy millennials do something with their life other than eat Tide pods and watch YouTube videos,��� said MAGA-hat wearing, Trump voter Carl Richards, 42, from Atlanta. ���They could use the direction, the discipline, and should want to fight to protect our country from foreign invasion. It���s what I would have done when I was their age. Not doing it now, of course. Got myself some really tender soles, and I can���t walk for too long before my feet really start to hurt.

John Durham, appointed by then-Attorney General William Barr in 2020 to probe the origins of the FBI���s investigation of Russian election interference, said ���Tech Executive-1,��� not named in the filing but first identified by The New York Times as Rodney Joffe, used his access to domain name system, or DNS, data to compile information about which computers and servers the White House servers were communicating with.

Trump and his allies said the disclosure was proof that Trump was under surveillance while he was in office. ���They were spying on the sitting president of the United States,��� Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told Fox News on Sunday. ���And it goes right to the Clinton campaign.��� In a statement Monday, Trump said the alleged spying was ���the biggest story of our time, bigger than Watergate.���

The filing does not specify whether any of the data collection occurred while Trump was in office. It also does not allege that the content of any communications from the Executive Office of the President (EOP) or any parties were compromised or read and there���s no indication data collection went beyond identifying where the internet traffic came from and where it went.

Cybersecurity expert Rob Graham told NBC News that what Joffe appeared to have been doing was a search for domain names and addresses to which a computer had tried to connect.

When you type in the name of a website like Google.com, Graham said, DNS will translate it to a specific IP address and a specific group of servers. Monitoring such traffic reveals only that one computer or server is trying to reach another, he said, not the contents of a person���s screen or messages.

The disclosure about Joffe, who has not been charged, came in a filing in the court case of Michael Sussmann, a lawyer whom Durham���s office indicted in September in connection with allegations of lying about his relationship with the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. 

In the filing Friday, prosecutors said ���Tech Executive-1��� gave Sussmann data about communications between computer servers at the EOP, two Trump-owned buildings in New York and an unrelated medical firm with Russian-made cellphones near the White House.

According to prosecutors, Sussmann gave the data to an unnamed federal agency at a meeting on Feb. 9, 2017, 20 days into the Trump administration, and said the data ���demonstrated that Trump and/or his associates were using supposedly rare, Russian-made wireless phones in the vicinity of the White House and other locations.���

���The Special Counsel���s Office has identified no support for these allegations,��� the filing said.

According to prosecutors, Sussmann did not disclose to the agency, identified by the Times as the CIA, that he was working for a client when he provided the report, when he was actually representing ���Tech Executive-1,��� aka Joffe.

Legal experts said Sussmann could face additional legal exposure if he failed to disclose his relationship to Joffe.

On Monday, attorneys for Sussmann filed a response to the special counsel���s Friday filing, in which they alleged the special counsel had attempted to create the impression that Sussmann had provided the CIA with data collected from the White House during Trump���s presidency ��� despite knowing that data given to the agency dated from the Obama administration.

���Although the Special Counsel implies that in Mr. Sussmann���s February 9, 2017 meeting, he provided Agency-2 with EOP data from after Mr. Trump took office,��� said the attorney, ���the Special Counsel is well aware that the data provided to Agency-2 pertained only to the period of time before Mr. Trump took office, when Barack Obama was President.���

The attorneys also said that Sussmann never billed the Clinton campaign for the February meeting with the CIA, nor could he have because the campaign had effectively ceased to exist.

Sussmann���s attorneys told the court, ���This is not the first time in this case that the Special Counsel has sought to include allegations about uncharged conduct in public filings and done so using inflammatory and prejudicial rhetoric.���

In a statement, a spokesperson for Joffe said, ���Contrary to the allegations in [the special counsel���s] recent filing, Mr. Joffe is an apolitical internet security expert with decades of service to the U.S. Government who has never worked for a political party, and who legally provided access to DNS data obtained from a private client that separately was providing DNS services to the Executive Office of the President (EOP).���

Joffe���s spokesperson said that under the terms of his contract, ���the data could be accessed to identify and analyze any security breaches or threats.���

���As a result of the hacks of EOP and [Democratic National Committee] servers in 2015 and 2016, respectively, there were serious and legitimate national security concerns about Russian attempts to infiltrate the 2016 election,��� the spokesperson said. ���Upon identifying DNS queries from Russian-made Yota phones in proximity to the Trump campaign and the EOP, respected cyber-security researchers were deeply concerned about the anomalies they found in the data and prepared a report of their findings, which was subsequently shared with the CIA.���

A spokesperson for special counsel Durham���s office said the office declines to comment beyond the court filings and any response will be in future filings with the court. 

Durham���s office originally indicted Sussmann in September. As NBC News has previously reported, Sussmann���s indictment says that he was advising the Clinton campaign in 2016 about cybersecurity matters and that a partner at his firm served as general counsel for the campaign. According to prosecutors, during a Sept. 19, 2016, meeting between Sussmann and the FBI���s general counsel at the time, James Baker, Sussmann told Baker about suspicions relating to alleged secret communications between the Trump campaign and Russia. Prosecutors said Sussmann ���stated falsely��� that he was not working for any client in reporting the suspicions.

The suspicions, which involved internet traffic with Russia���s Alfa-Bank, were later determined to be unfounded.

At the time of the indictment, Sussmann���s attorneys issued a statement that said: ���Michael Sussmann was indicted today because of politics, not facts. ��� This case represents the opposite of everything the Department of Justice is supposed to stand for.

���At its core, the Special Counsel is bringing a false statement charge based on an oral statement allegedly made five years ago to a single witness that is unrecorded and unobserved by anyone else. The Department of Justice would ordinarily never bring such a baseless case.���

Durham���s investigation continues and has resulted in one other indictment besides Sussmann���s. Last year, he charged a Russian analyst who was a source for the Steele dossier with lying to the FBI. 

Durham was also acting U.S. attorney for Connecticut during the Clinton administration and acting U.S. attorney and then U.S. attorney during the Trump administration, leaving office last year.

Friday���s court filing was made as part of an inquiry about whether the law firm Latham & Watkins had a conflict of interest in serving as counsel to Sussmann because it also represented other parties with interests in the case.

0,"Taiwan watching Ukraine crisis with 'concern and anxiety,' says top diplomat in U.S.","WASHINGTON ��� Taiwan is watching events in Ukraine with ""much concern and anxiety"" but plans to make any possible Chinese military attack on Taiwan ""too painful"" to consider, Taipei���s representative in Washington, Bi-khim Hsiao, told NBC News in an interview.

Hsiao made the comments as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned during a trip to Asia over the weekend that other countries were monitoring the Ukraine crisis closely and that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could have repercussions for the Pacific region.

Hsiao, who arrived in Washington in 2020 to lead Taiwan���s diplomatic mission in the U.S., said her government hoped the crisis over Ukraine could be settled through diplomacy.

""Like everyone else in the world, we are watching the situation with much concern and anxiety,"" she said. ""We certainly hope that the situation can be resolved peacefully through diplomatic means. But at the same time, Taiwan has distinct historical and geopolitical circumstances, and we need to be focused on our priority and that is bolstering Taiwan's self defense.""

For more, watch Hallie Jackson Now on NBC News Now at 5 p.m. ET today.

Taiwan���s president, Tsai Ing-wen, said last month her nation ""empathized"" with the plight of Ukrainians due to the military threat Taiwan faces from its powerful, larger neighbor. She ordered the creation of a task force to study how tensions between Russia and Ukraine could affect Taiwan���s own long-running conflict with Beijing.

Former U.S. officials say China will gauge the U.S. response to Russia as a possible guide to how Washington might counter a crisis over Taiwan.


Russia receives strong support from China in Ukraine standoff
FEB. 4, 202201:17
Asked about a recent joint declaration from Moscow and Beijing in which Chinese President Xi Jinping expressed support for Russia���s stance on Ukraine, Hsiao said the two countries were cooperating in ways that posed a challenge to democracies.

""I think it's pretty clear to all of us around the world that those undermining stability are China and Russia,"" she said.

Russia���s troop buildup around Ukraine began last year, but Taiwanese and U.S. officials say China has been engaged in threatening behavior towards Taipei for years, including deploying missiles near the island and repeatedly flying into the island���s air defense zone.

Hsiao, who was raised in Taiwan and educated at Oberlin College in Ohio and Columbia University in New York, said Taiwan has made clear it wants the dispute with Beijing resolved peacefully and has focused on strengthening its defenses to send a signal to Beijing that it would pay a price for any aggression.

""The Chinese must not miscalculate our resolve to defend Taiwan's democracy and the peace and stability of the region,"" Hsiao said, adding, ""Our goal, everything that we are doing, is to bolster our self defenses in a way that would make any consideration or operationalization of the threat too painful to consider.""

Beijing considers Taiwan an integral part of China that must be brought back under Chinese rule, by force if necessary. The U.S. recognized Beijing as the sole government of China in 1979 but refused to support the Chinese regime���s claims of sovereignty over Taiwan. Washington has also committed to providing for the defense of Taipei, without ever precisely spelling out what that entails.


China has accused the U.S. of fueling tensions in the Pacific with naval patrols, trying to block Beijing���s rise as a world power and provoking conflict by selling fighter jets and other weaponry to Taiwan.

""Taiwan is an inalienable part of China���s territory. These facts are grounded in history and law, and represent a universally agreed norm governing international relations,"" said Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for China���s embassy in Washington. ""China���s reunification is an unstoppable historical trend that will not be changed by anyone, any force or any country.""

Flights and other activity by the People���s Liberation Army near Taiwan were designed to protect the principle of ""one-China"" and to promote peace in the Taiwan Strait, Pengyu said in an email to NBC News.

""Over the past year,"" he said, ""the PLA has conducted regular patrols and combat drills in the waters and airspace around the Taiwan island. The objectives of these actions are very clear: to take decisive countermeasures against the egregious actions of forces within and outside the island to collude and challenge the one-China principle; to resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity; and to concretely safeguard the common welfare of compatriots on both sides of the Strait and maintain peace and stability in the Strait.""

Hsiao said China has tried to wear down Taipei through pressure tactics, bullying and disinformation that stops short of outright military action, in what her government calls ""gray zone warfare.""

Last month, Taiwan had to scramble fighter jets to warn off 32 Chinese military aircraft that flew into the island���s air defense zone.

""The Chinese have also been launching cyberattacks, disinformation, cognitive and psychological warfare on the people of Taiwan, aimed at weakening our resolve to our self-defense and also trying to sow divisions within our society,"" the diplomat said.

Last year, the then-head of the U.S. military���s Indo-Pacific Command, Adm. Phil Davidson, warned lawmakers that China���s goal was to take control of Taiwan and that it could stage an invasion within ""the next six years.""

Hsiao said Taiwan and the U.S. were engaged in ""intense cooperation and engagement to bolster Taiwan's self defenses"" with the aim of persuading Beijing not to launch a military attack.

""We are not in a position to engage in an arms race with China. What we are doing is to fortify our defenses in a smart and strategic way so that we have the capacity to deter a military threat,"" she said.

Governments that have refused to sever ties with Taiwan or that have criticized Beijing have faced economic retaliation from China, including Lithuania and Australia, she said. Democratic countries need to rally, she said, and show China that Beijing���s ""coercion"" will not succeed.

""Bullies bully because they think they can get away with it,"" she said. ""And I think it's all the more important now that democracies work together to look into the toolbox we have in terms of countering economic coercion.""

China���s crushing of democracy in Hong Kong had ""destroyed any credibility"" that Beijing would be willing to grant more democratic rights or autonomy to some regions, under the ""One Country, Two Systems"" formula, she said.

Hsiao said Taiwan faced a difficult choice when it came to sending its athletes to the Olympic Games hosted by China.

Taiwan had to balance its concerns with China���s human rights record with Taipei���s efforts to be recognized on the world stage after being excluded or sidelined by Beijing, she said. ""It was a very complicated situation for us,"" she said.

The government of Taiwan decided to send athletes while joining a diplomatic boycott along with the United States, Australia and other governments.

The government also had to take into account the need to ensure ""Taiwan's continuing international participation in other occasions and international sports events,"" she said.

Hsiao has pushed back against China���s assertive public messaging with a bit of humor. While China���s blunt-speaking envoys are known for their ""wolf warrior diplomacy,"" Hsiao refers to herself as the ""cat warrior.""

Taiwan has a lot in common with felines, she said.

""I believe cats are certainly much more lovable than wolves. Cats are nimble, flexible, cats can survive in small spaces, which exemplifies Taiwan's current international situation,"" she said.

""But also, cats have the characteristic that we cannot be coerced. And cats have nine lives and we're surviving in a very precarious, volatile situation where we're often walking on tightropes, and achieving that balance for our own survival.""",TRUE,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/taiwan-watching-ukraine-crisis-concern-anxiety-says-diplomat-n1289101,Politics,NBC
