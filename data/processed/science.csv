This one is pretty straightforward. I'm citing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: _LINKS_ 5:40 p.m. June 8, 2017 Sure: first, global temperatures are more relevant to the total impacts we will face than state or even continental numbers. For example, focusing on the Texas-only data actually obscures rather than illuminates if you are trying to help Texans gauge the risk. Two of the big dangers to us are sea level rise and Gulf hurricanes. Those risks are going to be driven by polar region warming (ice melt) and ocean surface temperatures (thermal expansion of ocean water and hurricane-fueling hot ocean surfaces) vs. average land temps in Texas. Flooding in Central Texas would also be affected by ocean temps and the regional weather dynamics they set up. In short: the fact that we may not set a record in a given year here in Texas won't protect us from the impacts of a record-setting year globally, so the global temps should get our attention.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2017/jun/15/derrick-crowe/democrat-lamar-smith-three-years-hottest-record-ea/,Science,Polifact
9372,U.S. to Cede Its Oversight of Addresses on Internet,"WASHINGTON  The United States will give up its role overseeing the system of Web addresses and domain names that form the basic plumbing of the Internet, turning it over in 2015 to an international group whose structure and administration will be determined over the next year, government officials said on Friday. Since the dawn of the Internet, the United States has been responsible for assigning the numbers that form Internet addresses, the .com, .gov and .org labels that correspond to those numbers, and for the vast database that links the two and makes sure Internet traffic goes to the right place. The function has been subcontracted since 1998 to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann, an international nonprofit organization, with the expectation that the United States would eventually step back from its role. But that transition has taken on a new urgency in the last year because of revelations that the United States intelligence community, particularly the National Security Agency, has been intercepting Internet traffic as part of its global spying efforts.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2016/sep/14/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-incorrect-about-obama-giving-control-inte/,Science,Polifact
10946,Statement by FBI Director James B. Comey on the Investigation of Secretary Hillary Clintons Use of a Personal E-Mail System,"Remarks prepared for delivery at press briefing. Good morning. Im here to give you an update on the FBIs investigation of Secretary Clintons use of a personal e-mail system during her time as Secretary of State. After a tremendous amount of work over the last year, the FBI is completing its investigation and referring the case to the Department of Justice for a prosecutive decision. What I would like to do today is tell you three things: what we did; what we found; and what we are recommending to the Department of Justice. This will be an unusual statement in at least a couple ways. First, I am going to include more detail about our process than I ordinarily would, because I think the American people deserve those details in a case of intense public interest. Second, I have not coordinated or reviewed this statement in any way with the Department of Justice or any other part of the government. They do not know what I am about to say. I want to start by thanking the FBI employees who did remarkable work in this case. Once you have a better sense of how much we have done, you will understand why I am so grateful and proud of their efforts. So, first, what we have done: The investigation began as a referral from the Intelligence Community Inspector General in connection with Secretary Clintons use of a personal e-mail server during her time as Secretary of State. The referral focused on whether classified information was transmitted on that personal system. Our investigation looked at whether there is evidence classified information was improperly stored or transmitted on that personal system, in violation of a federal statute making it a felony to mishandle classified information either intentionally or in a grossly negligent way, or a second statute making it a misdemeanor to knowingly remove classified information from appropriate systems or storage facilities. Consistent with our counterintelligence responsibilities, we have also investigated to determine whether there is evidence of computer intrusion in connection with the personal e-mail server by any foreign power, or other hostile actors. I have so far used the singular term, e-mail server, in describing the referral that began our investigation. It turns out to have been more complicated than that. Secretary Clinton used several different servers and administrators of those servers during her four years at the State Department, and used numerous mobile devices to view and send e-mail on that personal domain. As new servers and equipment were employed, older servers were taken out of service, stored, and decommissioned in various ways. Piecing all of that back togetherto gain as full an understanding as possible of the ways in which personal e-mail was used for government workhas been a painstaking undertaking, requiring thousands of hours of effort. For example, when one of Secretary Clintons original personal servers was decommissioned in 2013, the e-mail software was removed. Doing that didnt remove the e-mail content, but it was like removing the frame from a huge finished jigsaw puzzle and dumping the pieces on the floor. The effect was that millions of e-mail fragments end up unsorted in the servers unusedor slackspace. We searched through all of it to see what was there, and what parts of the puzzle could be put back together. FBI investigators have also read all of the approximately 30,000 e-mails provided by Secretary Clinton to the State Department in December 2014. Where an e-mail was assessed as possibly containing classified information, the FBI referred the e-mail to any U.S. government agency that was a likely owner of information in the e-mail, so that agency could make a determination as to whether the e-mail contained classified information at the time it was sent or received, or whether there was reason to classify the e-mail now, even if its content was not classified at the time it was sent (that is the process sometimes referred to as up-classifying). From the group of 30,000 e-mails returned to the State Department, 110 e-mails in 52 e-mail chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received. Eight of those chains contained information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent; 36 chains contained Secret information at the time; and eight contained Confidential information, which is the lowest level of classification. Separate from those, about 2,000 additional e-mails were up-classified to make them Confidential; the information in those had not been classified at the time the e-mails were sent. The FBI also discovered several thousand work-related e-mails that were not in the group of 30,000 that were returned by Secretary Clinton to State in 2014. We found those additional e-mails in a variety of ways. Some had been deleted over the years and we found traces of them on devices that supported or were connected to the private e-mail domain. Others we found by reviewing the archived government e-mail accounts of people who had been government employees at the same time as Secretary Clinton, including high-ranking officials at other agencies, people with whom a Secretary of State might naturally correspond. This helped us recover work-related e-mails that were not among the 30,000 produced to State. Still others we recovered from the laborious review of the millions of e-mail fragments dumped into the slack space of the server decommissioned in 2013. With respect to the thousands of e-mails we found that were not among those produced to State, agencies have concluded that three of those were classified at the time they were sent or received, one at the Secret level and two at the Confidential level. There were no additional Top Secret e-mails found. Finally, none of those we found have since been up-classified. I should add here that we found no evidence that any of the additional work-related e-mails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them. Our assessment is that, like many e-mail users, Secretary Clinton periodically deleted e-mails or e-mails were purged from the system when devices were changed. Because she was not using a government accountor even a commercial account like Gmailthere was no archiving at all of her e-mails, so it is not surprising that we discovered e-mails that were not on Secretary Clintons system in 2014, when she produced the 30,000 e-mails to the State Department. It could also be that some of the additional work-related e-mails we recovered were among those deleted as personal by Secretary Clintons lawyers when they reviewed and sorted her e-mails for production in 2014. The lawyers doing the sorting for Secretary Clinton in 2014 did not individually read the content of all of her e-mails, as we did for those available to us; instead, they relied on header information and used search terms to try to find all work-related e-mails among the reportedly more than 60,000 total e-mails remaining on Secretary Clintons personal system in 2014. It is highly likely their search terms missed some work-related e-mails, and that we later found them, for example, in the mailboxes of other officials or in the slack space of a server. It is also likely that there are other work-related e-mails that they did not produce to State and that we did not find elsewhere, and that are now gone because they deleted all e-mails they did not return to State, and the lawyers cleaned their devices in such a way as to preclude complete forensic recovery. We have conducted interviews and done technical examination to attempt to understand how that sorting was done by her attorneys. Although we do not have complete visibility because we are not able to fully reconstruct the electronic record of that sorting, we believe our investigation has been sufficient to give us reasonable confidence there was no intentional misconduct in connection with that sorting effort. And, of course, in addition to our technical work, we interviewed many people, from those involved in setting up and maintaining the various iterations of Secretary Clintons personal server, to staff members with whom she corresponded on e-mail, to those involved in the e-mail production to State, and finally, Secretary Clinton herself. Last, we have done extensive work to understand what indications there might be of compromise by hostile actors in connection with the personal e-mail operation. Thats what we have done. Now let me tell you what we found: Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information. For example, seven e-mail chains concern matters that were classified at the Top Secret/Special Access Program level when they were sent and received. These chains involved Secretary Clinton both sending e-mails about those matters and receiving e-mails from others about the same matters. There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clintons position, or in the position of those government employees with whom she was corresponding about these matters, should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation. In addition to this highly sensitive information, we also found information that was properly classified as Secret by the U.S. Intelligence Community at the time it was discussed on e-mail (that is, excluding the later up-classified e-mails). None of these e-mails should have been on any kind of unclassified system, but their presence is especially concerning because all of these e-mails were housed on unclassified personal servers not even supported by full-time security staff, like those found at Departments and Agencies of the U.S. Governmentor even with a commercial service like Gmail. Separately, it is important to say something about the marking of classified information. Only a very small number of the e-mails containing classified information bore markings indicating the presence of classified information. But even if information is not marked classified in an e-mail, participants who know or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it. While not the focus of our investigation, we also developed evidence that the security culture of the State Department in general, and with respect to use of unclassified e-mail systems in particular, was generally lacking in the kind of care for classified information found elsewhere in the government. With respect to potential computer intrusion by hostile actors, we did not find direct evidence that Secretary Clintons personal e-mail domain, in its various configurations since 2009, was successfully hacked. But, given the nature of the system and of the actors potentially involved, we assess that we would be unlikely to see such direct evidence. We do assess that hostile actors gained access to the private commercial e-mail accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact from her personal account. We also assess that Secretary Clintons use of a personal e-mail domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent. She also used her personal e-mail extensively while outside the United States, including sending and receiving work-related e-mails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. Given that combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clintons personal e-mail account. So thats what we found. Finally, with respect to our recommendation to the Department of Justice: In our system, the prosecutors make the decisions about whether charges are appropriate based on evidence the FBI has helped collect. Although we dont normally make public our recommendations to the prosecutors, we frequently make recommendations and engage in productive conversations with prosecutors about what resolution may be appropriate, given the evidence. In this case, given the importance of the matter, I think unusual transparency is in order. Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case. Prosecutors necessarily weigh a number of factors before bringing charges. There are obvious considerations, like the strength of the evidence, especially regarding intent. Responsible decisions also consider the context of a persons actions, and how similar situations have been handled in the past. In looking back at our investigations into mishandling or removal of classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts. All the cases prosecuted involved some combination of: clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information; or vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional misconduct; or indications of disloyalty to the United States; or efforts to obstruct justice. We do not see those things here. To be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances, a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences. To the contrary, those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions. But that is not what we are deciding now. As a result, although the Department of Justice makes final decisions on matters like this, we are expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case. I know there will be intense public debate in the wake of this recommendation, as there was throughout this investigation. What I can assure the American people is that this investigation was done competently, honestly, and independently. No outside influence of any kind was brought to bear. I know there were many opinions expressed by people who were not part of the investigationincluding people in governmentbut none of that mattered to us. Opinions are irrelevant, and they were all uninformed by insight into our investigation, because we did the investigation the right way. Only facts matter, and the FBI found them here in an entirely apolitical and professional way. I couldnt be prouder to be part of this organization.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/06/hillary-clinton/fbi-findings-tear-holes-hillary-clintons-email-def/,Science,Polifact
11543,The Politics of the Gorilla Story,"RUSH: Were gonna get to the gorilla business. Thats easily explained, too. Folks, you remember when the two fish, what kind of fish were they, I keep thinking dolphins or porpoises, way back in the nineties, a couple of them got caught in sea ice, way far north of where they should have been, and the whole country became captivated with, will they find their way out? What can we do? Can we cut holes in the ice so that the porpoise, the dolphins, whatever they were, can we guide them out? Can we do something? Can we save them? Everybody became captivated. Same thing here, the same principles are involved, except now there was politics in this Cincinnati Zoo thing because theres politics in everything. Cant take it out. Cant escape it. Cant avoid it. And Im gonna explain that also as the program unfolds. To show you how silly it got. For a time Black Lives Matter even got upset about this because they originally thought the parents and the boy were white. Then when they found out that the parents and boy were black, then all hell broke loose and they had to back off and take a different tack on this. (interruption) What are you laughing at? Thats exactly what happened. You denying that? You didnt know that? You didnt know Black Lives Matter got involved? (laughing) It was Black Lives Matter versus gorilla lives matter versus do any life matter, human life versus animal life, what matters most. Easily explainable in our really screwed-up culture and society today. I can make it understandable from top to bottom, which I will do, BREAK TRANSCRIPT RUSH: To Harambe, the gorilla at the Cincinnati Zoo. A 400 pound wild animal born in captivity, but gorillas are not domesticated, contrary to what the feminists think. Dont most feminists that are married think theyre married to gorillas anyway? Its like dragons, folks. You cant tame em. Youve seen Game of Thrones. You cant tame a dragon. These are not pets. But we name them. This ones name was Harambe. And I assume we think that he knew his name. And we assume that he probably liked his name. So a four-year-old child happens to plunge into the gorilla pen at the Cincinnati Zoo before anybody notices it. And in order to save his life, the zoo people made the decision to kill the gorilla. Now, I am totally aware of why so many people think that the zoo made the wrong decision. I totally understand American pop culture today. I understand our society. I understand where it is. I understand that, in our culture today, that gorilla, compared to any human being, is the essence of innocence, even a four-year-old child. In fact, many on the left, dont doubt me on this, youre gonna think this is funny or crazy, but Im dead serious. Many on the left compare that gorilla in the zoo with unfair imprisonment of human beings. That zoo is the equivalent of a prison, and of course those kinds of people think that we have too many people in jail in this country. That they are in jail because theyve been railroaded, not because theyve committed any crimes. Thats the first thing. It may not be something that they consciously voice, but it is in their subconscious the way they look at this. Im talking particularly about leftists. The whole zoo thing is unfair. The whole zoo thing is an example of human bigotry, racism, whatever else, mean-spiritedness, extremism, humans are the cause of global warming. Humans are the cause of climate change. Humans are the cause of animal suffering. Humans are the cause of everything going wrong on earth. By definition, these people cannot be familiar with Genesis, and if they were, they would dissociate themselves from it. They have absolutely no such training, foundation, or awareness of the primacy of humanity on planet Earth as created by God. Such a mind-set does not exist with them. Its the exact opposite. Humanity is the problem. Humanity is not the solution. So a young child falls in. There are stages of video that are produced by people that were there, and the first video is always the one that makes the impression, Looky, that gorilla was trying to save that boy. He was trying to pull his pants up, even, so he wasnt ashamed, nude, in that moat. This gorilla was trying to protect that boy. That gorilla, he was a new playmate. Dont forget, Americas most prominent exposure to gorillas is with Koko. Koko is a female gorilla who picks NFL games every Friday. Koko uses sign language. Koko has become a human. We humanize all animals, particularly those that we can go watch, maybe even pet, get close to. And we attend to associate  some of us do, some people transfer their own traits to animals and think that theres no difference other than maybe intelligence or what have you. But as I looked at it, it took me one thing to see. That gorilla is 400 pounds, and when that gorilla scooped that kid up and ran at breakneck speed through that moat, dragging the kid behind him, the gorilla doesnt know from protecting the little guy boys head from banging against the wall. The gorilla doesnt know from drowning. The gorilla doesnt know from anything. But most people dont want to assume that. They want to assign protector status to the gorilla, as youll hear in an audio sound bite. The thing is, nobody was gonna get that boy out of that gorillas hands. Nobody was gonna be able to walk, no, there and say, Hey, Harambe, hey, bud, hey, you know, we need to take that little toy that you just got, we need to take it away from you. Right. It was not going to happen. Harambe was not gonna deliver the boy somewhere to a zoo keeper to take it back to its mother. I know he was holding the boys hand. Sat him up. I know. I know how the pictures look. He was his friend, he was protecting him, was a new buddy down there, understand all that. Harambe wasnt gonna hurt him. Harambe was loving and caring and so forth, probably a better parent than many humans are. Probably treating that boy better than maybe his own family does. You just never know. You just never know, right? That gorilla could have been teaching us all a lesson on how to deal with kids. I mean, folks, look at social media, youll find all kinds of explanations. Social media has just become such a sewer that even Fakebook, Google, and all the others are promising to clean it up every 24 hours, hate speech gone in 24 hours. You want to bet? Certain hate speech is gonna be applauded, its gonna be strategically placed, that against conservatives. Media lies about conservatives/Republicans will still be featured prominently in trending, you name it. But, anyway, I just dont think there was any way that boy was gonna get out of there alive short of what happened. And I think the people that are being forgotten in all this are the zoo people that had to do it. I think in all the agony thats out there today, the people that run that zoo that had to do this are probably feeling the worst of anybody, cause that gorilla was part of their lives. The gorilla had a handler, somebody fed the gorilla. The gorillas born in captivity, so the gorilla had a lot of contact with people at this zoo, and to have to take the gorilla out to save the boy, theyre gonna be distressed over this for a long, long time, the people that run that zoo and had to make the decision, whatever, to pull the trigger. But it comes down to, what do you value here? Should the boy lose his life because the mother was irresponsible, let him plunge in the first place? Should the gorillas life take primacy? It was the gorillas home. The gorilla wasnt doing anything to anybody. The gorilla was minding its own business, all of a sudden this four-year-old kid falls in there, its the gorillas fault? We gotta kill the gorilla? Depends on how you value human life versus all other life on the planet. And even, you know, folks, so sad, it even had a racial component. Originally when it was not known what race the child and the parents were, you should have seen some of the comments then. And then it was Black Lives Matter getting involved in all this. And then they found out, no, wait, cant go there, had to back off and go elsewhere. The way people on the left look at things is just continually itself insufferable and insulting. I mentioned earlier the two, I think they were dolphins or porpoises, that somehow strayed way north of their natural  (interruption) was it New Jersey? No, no. There was ice  no, no. No, no, no. I mean way north. Were talking Canada here. They were mammals. They had to surface to be able to breathe. And we were cutting holes in the ice for them to do so, and we were trying to cut holes in the ice in a way that would steer them to safety, if they follow the holes. I remember back then, this is in the nineties sometime, I remember taking calls from people on, Why are we wasting all this money? Its a couple of fish, for crying out loud, they got lost, big deal. And I recall the incident, the same thing had happened to a blue whale or something, happened Sacramento Delta. The thing had gotten screwed up and it swam up from the San Francisco Bay all the way up the Sacramento Delta area and was running out of saltwater and they were all worried about what to do with it. They were trying to figure out a way to turn it around and go back to where it should be. I remember defending the fish. I remember on this program telling people, Look, you have to understand why so many people are concerned about this. Theyve done nothing wrong. They maybe got lost, went a different way, but these animals, compared to all else going on, theyre innocent. Theyre struggling on their own. Theyre trying to live. Its not like theyre a bunch of welfare recipients taking the day off out there. They are doing everything they can to survive. So us helping them makes all the sense in the world to me. But, Im telling you, folks, 20 years ago when that happened, the vast majority of sentiment was not for those dolphin or porpoises, whatever they were. It was people asking, Why are we spending so much money? Military helicopters, we were spending a lot of money breaking the ice, drilling holes, trying to get em out of there. And people thought it was a waste of money. Hey, it happens, its nature. They went the wrong place, pay the consequences. No, no, I said, people have to understand, theyre the essence of innocence, theyre trying to save themselves, and were trying to help them do that. This situation, here you have a gorilla minding its own business in its own home not bothering anybody. It had never bothered anybody. And then some mother looks the other way for a while and her kid plunges into the gorilla pen, and while the gorilla is holding her baby and dragging the baby along and so forth, the mother, Mommys here! Mommys here! And people say, Mommys where? Why isnt Mommy down there trying to get the kid back? Most mommies would be doing what they can instead of shouting Mommys here! Mommys here!' Nobody was gonna get the kid back. And youve heard they didnt want to use tranquilizer. That would have just made the gorilla mad. It would have taken a long time to go into effect, to take effect, and who knows what the gorilla would have done had he gotten mad. So its an unfortunate circumstance, but they didnt have any other choice. If they wanted to save that child, that was the only way they were gonna do it. I know a lot of people want to believe that whoever Harambes friends were on the zoo staff could have walked in there, you know, with a plate of food or what have you, or just with good vibes, Hey, Harambe, how are you? You know that thing you have, thats not supposed to be here. Hand him over, whatever they were gonna do to get the gorilla to hand over his toy. Go to the audio sound bites. Not much here, but I want to illustrate. We have, who is this, where is this? What did I do with it? Oh, here it is, number 15, Ashley Byrne. This was yesterday on CNNs Newsroom in the morning, Carol Costello, this is PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, senior campaigner Ashley Byrne. Question: Do you agree that zoo officials had to kill the gorilla because they say they couldnt take a chance the gorilla would react badly if they shot him with a tranquilizer dart? BYRNE: In many circumstances gorillas have shown that they can be protective of children or small beings. Frankly, the fact that this gorilla was innocent in the first place, thats the first place that this situation went wrong because even under the best circumstances captivity is never adequate for gorillas and other primates. And in cases like this we see that its even deadly. And this tragedy is exactly why PETA urges families to stay away from any facility, zoos, circuses, or otherwise, that displays animals as a sideshow for humans to gawk at. RUSH: Animals (sigh) This woman obviously has not read Genesis and even if she did, it wouldnt have any impact on her. But human beings travel all over the world to gawk at animals precisely because theyre unusual! Theyre interesting. Some are cute, some are deadly, some Theres no way human beings are gonna not be interested in animals. Gawking at them out on safari, hunting them or what have you. By the way, you know theres another factor in this, Snerdley? A lot of people think that all of us used to be apes. Dont doubt me on this. A lot of people think that all of us used to be gorillas, and theyre looking for the missing link out there. The evolution crowd. They think we were originally apes. Ive always had a question: If we were the original apes, then how come Harambe is still an ape, and how come he didnt become one of us? Well, thats why theyre all missing link, Mr. Limbaugh. Your question is absurd. Heres one more from Ashley Byrne from PETA. You know, the gorillas endangered, he was 17 years old. Theyve had him for quite a long time. BYRNE: He was 17 years old and r-reports say that he had a young baby of his own  who, of course, is now without a father. So, y-you know, again (snickers), I think this shows us the tragic side of keeping animals in zoos for our entertainment. But it can go horribly wrong, and that the zoo failed Harambe by taking the risk that something like this would happen. RUSH: So Harambes child is now without a father, one of the many unfortunate aspects of this. So another busted gorilla home at the Cincinnati Zoo. And you know what happens. BREAK TRANSCRIPT RUSH: If something had happened to that four-year-old boy in the gorilla pen, you know what the catcalls would be. Why didnt you shoot the gorilla? Why did you wait? So the zoo people, theyre not gonna win no matter what. But my guess is they feel worse than anybody about this, the people that had to do it. BREAK TRANSCRIPT RUSH: I want to take at least one more call right now, maybe two. We go to Chicago. This is Dannette. Im glad you called. Hi. CALLER: I love you, I love you, I love you, but I have to say: You really make me angry when you start making fun of animal lovers. RUSH: I dont make fun of animal lovers. CALLER: Okay, just now when you were talking about that gal from PETA, you were making fun of what she was saying. RUSH: Shes a liberal! She is not an animal lover. Shes a leftist who is interested in the advancement of the liberal agenda by her  CALLER: Okay, but  RUSH:  attitude toward humanity and its insignificance and its cruelty and so forth. Believe me, PETA is a left-wing, liberal organization using animal rights  just like feminism is a bunch of liberals using womens issues  to advance the leftist agenda. CALLER: Okay, but Rush, I am not a liberal by any means. Im a big Trump fan, and Im a big animal lover. Ive got my own pet  RUSH: So am I! Im the biggest animal lover you ever met. CALLER: Okay, but Okay, this gorilla got killed because of why? Human error. No matter how you look at it, human error. I dont humanize animals. Um, but you know what? Someones gotta stick up for them, and someone does have to give them rights. RUSH: I just did. I just did. I pointed out the gorilla was bothering nobody, the gorilla was doing what gorillas do. It was minding its own business, it was in its home, and all of a sudden, a human four-year-old drops in there. CALLER: Absolutely. And, okay, now, whats gonna be the question? The zoo wasnt taking precautions enough. There wasnt a high enough wall. This is such bullcrap with these children going on  RUSH: Wait. Wait a minute. You may not have heard, but the Cincinnati police are looking into criminal charges against the zoo. CALLER: And on Fox News this morning they said there were not gonna be any charges, the parents were going to be cleared. You know what? Its  RUSH: No, no! No, no! Wait! Not against the parents. The zoo, precisely because the four-year-old was able to fall in there. CALLER: Okay, see, and thats what I mean. When is it gonna be the parents responsibility? I dont know what the frick the mother was doing  RUSH: Forget that. Thats never No. That isnt gonna happen. CALLER: This is why the generation of kids is ending up to be the generation of what they are. Because its never their fault, its never the parents fault  and again, I am so much for animals. I felt so bad for this gorilla. Like you said, he was just doing his own thing, and Im one of those animal-crazy people where if theres a person on the side of the road thats injured, and theres an animal on the side of the road thats injured, the person is screwed with me. Thats all there is to it, because I just think people make their own decisions and a lot of times, Rush, theyre very evil. Theyre very evil. And with this gorilla I just felt really, really  RUSH: Youre making my point. What youre doing here is understandable. Youre looking at the animal. In your example, you got an injured animal on the side of the road, we dont know how it got there, and weve got an injured human being on the side of the road. Your automatic, your default position is to go check out the animal. You know why? Because its the essence of innocence. The human being had a choice, whether or not to get in an accident and be on the side of the road. The animal is just along for the ride and its not its fault no matter what, and it cant take care of itself so youve gotta go help it. CALLER: Absolutely. RUSH: All right. CALLER: And I feel very strong about that. So if people want to call me crazy, so be it. But I feel I hold no bones about that. All my clients even know who I am and how I am with animals. RUSH: Nobodys calling you crazy! CALLER: Well  RUSH: Its just that in the  CALLER: Im sure, youre gonna get phone calls on this. You know this. RUSH: Well, maybe. I can handle that. Phone calls. CALLER: But, you know what? I love you. I told Mr. Snerdley, I love you to death; so I really, really do. RUSH: Well, you can rest assured that theres no bigger animal lover than me. I have three dogs and Ive got this little cat. CALLER: (giggles) RUSH: But even aside from that, the reason I know how you feel about animals is I feel the same way about them. But when it comes down in the gorilla case, situation, its just one of these unfortunate things. There was no way that anybody was gonna get that gorilla to hand over the baby. I guess you, in that circumstance, value the gorillas life more than the babys because the parents are the ultimate responsibility. CALLER: Thats right. RUSH: The kid wouldnt have fallen in there if the parents had been paying attention, so the parents need to pay the price; the gorilla doesnt. Thats your view. CALLER: Well, this is how I feel. You heard the mother on the tape, Mommys here! Mommys here! Where the good frick was Mommy two minutes ago before the kid fell in? RUSH: Right. CALLER: Where was Mommy? RUSH: Mommy was with the cotton candy vendor. I dont know what she was doing. CALLER: And, you know And again, thats just my view. I love you, Rush, but you know, animals are my world, and sometimes I just feel youre condescending to animal lovers. So RUSH: I am not condescending to animal lovers. I am condescending to PETA. I am condescending to people who use peoples natural love for animals as a way to advance the liberal agenda. Look, if you want to understand me, if youre ever confused with what I say, what I mean, understand: Its always my belief that theres politics in everything, and I am opposed to liberalism. And I am opposed to the seductive ways that liberalism corrupts people  innocent people  into assuming positions that are detrimental to American society and the culture and the country the large. And the left has got all these disparate groups. Theyve got animal rights groups, they got PETA, they got environmentalist wackos, theyve got feminists. This is how they do it. Every one of these groups ends up You notice whos to blame for all this? Its always humanity, usually conservative human beings or Republican human beings. Its human beings destroying the planet when I dont think we have the ability to. We dont have the ability to destroy the environment. If a president ordered the worlds most intelligent scientists to destroy the ozone, they couldnt do it. If a president or the pope ordered the smartest scientists in the world to destroy the climate of the earth, they could not do it. They wouldnt know where to begin. And yet were told every day that were doing it and were the cause. By what? Advancing and progress in our lives. And its BS. It is utter, total BS, and its one of the many webs of deceit that has been woven into the fabric of our society by the American and international left to advance their agenda of big government control over all people. Because people dont know whats best, people dont know whats important, people dont know whats important, or other things: People are selfish, people are this, people are that. And I resent the heck out of it. I do not make fun of animal lovers. I understand them. I try to protect them from getting lassoed into some liberal agenda that they dont understand and end up promoting and advancing while theyre not even aware that theyre doing it. And its just It gets absurd sometimes. But I have a reverence for animals. I dont spend a lot of time talking about it here because it just never comes up. But I do not make fun of animal lovers. I am one. I make fun of and I try to expose liberalism everywhere it is lurking. And it lurks. Its always behind the scenes and underneath the surface. Its never, ever out in the open. It couldnt survive if it were. So never forget that. Next time you hear me ripping into or making fun of what you think is an animal lover, stop and think for a moment: What is Rush really saying here? and take it beyond what you think it is. Understand that theres always going to be a political component because politics is part of everything. Whether people like it or not, want to admit it or not, thats the truth. BREAK TRANSCRIPT RUSH: Police originally said there werent gonna be any charges. Authorities are now taking a second look at the possibility of criminal charges in the incident after the police initially said that no one would be charged. And what theyre looking at, apparently the incident at the Cincinnati Zoo involved the young child who fell into the gorilla enclosure, the incident under investigation by the Cincinnati Police Department. Once the investigations concluded, theyll confer with the DAs office, the prosecutors office on possible criminal charges. This will be against the zoo I dont think for killing the gorilla. I think its gonna be about the enclosure and whether or not it was sufficient to prevent something like this from happening. Now, witnesses said that the child had expressed a desire to get into the enclosure and climbed over a three-foot barrier and then fell 15 feet into a moat. His mother on Facebook said he suffered a concussion and scrapes but was otherwise fine. I will guarantee you that all of this commentary, if you will, on social media is driving the cops to change their mind on perhaps pursuing a criminal investigation here. But you go talk to any lawyer you want, and the lawyer will tell you that charges against the parents in something like this will never happen. Theyll never be able to prove criminal child endangerment or anything of the sort. They wont even go there. That if there are charges, itll be against the zoo, and itll be in relationship to the enclosure where people are standing, observing the gorillas. BREAK TRANSCRIPT RUSH: Mark in Ridgefield Park, New Jersey. Great to have you with us. Youre next. Hello. CALLER: Hello, Rush. Pleasure talking with you, sir. RUSH: Thank you, sir, very much. CALLER: Regarding the gorilla shooting. Sometimes I feel like Im living in the Twilight Zone. Are we actually having a discussion between choosing the life of a gorilla over a boy? I mean, this is outrageous. Im thinking about it. RUSH: I cannot hear a word youre saying. Im having to read what youre saying. So you find it outrageous that people even think theres a question over whether to shoot the gorilla or not and save the boy? CALLER: Correct. To get to my bigger point, I mean, in America, we slaughter cows and pigs by the truckload on a daily basis. Theres no outrage about that. I mean, Im just trying to make sort of a funny point over this. Maybe the media is the one  RUSH: Yes. But, look, when you run over a possum, when you run over any other road kill animal or when we go to the slaughterhouse to slaughter a bunch of steers and stuff, it isnt on television, and there arent little children in the area that are being held by the hand of the animal about to be slaughtered. And those animals have not had movies made about them, nor are there storybooks about them. I mean, whens the last slaughterhouse comic book you read? CALLER: Yeah, youre right about that. RUSH: I mean, once the effort has been made to humanize pets, animals, it is thought that all animals could end up being pets if we just had the right circumstances. But this is  you know, the fact that its on TV and the fact that the first  never forget, the first video did not appear to show the child threatened at all. Why, Harambe was holding the boy out of the water. Harambe appeared to be keeping the child dressed, his pants up, was holding his hand. Thats the first video that was released. And the person that shot the video, another person who shot some videos saw that and said, Wait a minute, thats not the whole story. Then we got another video which showed Harambe grabbing the kid by the hand and darting under the water. The kid was being dragged through that moat under the tree as we lost sight of the kid for a while. It was at breakneck speed, and people, Oh, my God, the kids gonna have a broken neck. The kids arm is gonna be ripped off. Oh, my God, hes gonna slam the kids head against the wall. But that was the second video seen, not the first. And the first video showed a polite, even fatherly Harambe protecting the child from an irresponsible human parent. Social media gets in gear and Harambe was not threatening anybody, was in his own home, he didnt cause any of this, bammo, he gets shot. Theres a lot of affection for animals out there, particularly animals that are in captivity and havent done anything to anybody. Look, if you really stop, youll be able to understand all of those emotional reactions. Where it does get interesting is your point, when you reduce the question to its bare essence, save the boy, save the gorilla, thats what youre having trouble understanding how there can be any debate. The fact that people could be saying, Well, hey, its not the gorillas fault. The parents ought to pay a price for their negligence here. Wait, youre saying that boy should  Well, its not the gorillas fault. I can give you another example. I probably shouldnt. I can give you another example. Let me think about this other. Cause theres another example that illustrates this dilemma where human life loses when the questions asked. Makes you very uncomfortable to hear it. But in this case there are people who think that gorillas life mattered more. In a country with whatever million number of abortions every year, I mean, you cant factor that out in understanding how people would have problems placing value on which life counts most here.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2016/jun/03/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-asks-why-cincinnati-zoo-gorilla-hadn/,Science,Polifact
12030,What I Said at the Vatican About the Worlds Efforts to Fight Cancer,"Your Eminence, Your Eminences. And, Elana, thank you for that very gracious introduction. Ive have an opportunity in my 200-year career, as youve just heard. His Eminence and I were talking about age. I am 25 years older than His Eminence, but Ive spoken in a number of magnificent fora, but none more magnificent than this. And its a great, great honor to be back in the Vatican. And, Elana, I want to thank you for the introduction. But more than that, I want to thank you for your courage, and your familys courage, and the inspiration you give to so many young people around the world. It matters. Your Eminences, Im honored to be with you in this magnificent hall. And, Robin, thank you. Its good to be here. Its a pleasure to be with all of you scientists, physicians, faith leaders, philanthropists, patients, and their families. There is no cancer patient whose circumstances are not shared with everyone that loves them. I know, as millions of people around the world know. And I want to stand by thanking all of you who are here for your knowledge, your dedication, your tenacity, and for your pastoral care. Like tens of millions of people around the world, my family and I have been the beneficiaries of your wisdom, your commitment, your compassion when we were still clinging to hope that  my son Hunter is with me, and my son-in-law Howard  we were clinging to hope that Hunters brother, my son would somehow be the beneficiary of a last-minute breakthrough before God called him. If you permit me what they call in my country, in my Senate where I worked, whenever you wanted to make a personal statement, the protocol was to stand on the floor of the Senate and say, Id like to ask forgiveness for a point of personal privilege. I know hes not here at the moment. But I want to thank His Holiness for the personal time and the private time, the generosity with his time. As he was leaving the United States, I had the great privilege of escorting him to the aircraft in the city of Philadelphia. And he asked if he could meet with my family. We had just lost my son. And he met with my extended family in the hangar behind where the aircraft was. And I wish every grieving parent, brother, sister, mother, father would have had the benefit of his words, his prayers, his presence. He provided us with more comfort than even he I think will ever understand. We experienced in my family what binds so many in this room together and all across the world, how faith can turn loss into hope  and hope into action. Vice President Joe Biden greets His Holiness Pope Francis after delivering remarks on cancer at the Vaticans International Conference on Regenerative Medicine. Vatican City, April 29, 2016. (Official White House photo by David Lienemann) The Holy Father has given hope to so many people of all faiths in every part of the world with his strong words and humble ways. I arrived from Iraq, from Erbil just this morning, at 5:30 in the morning. And when I told the Shia leader of Iraq in Baghdad, the Kurd and Sunni leader of Iraq in Erbil where I was going, they each wanted to talk about the Holy Father. I think thats a pretty incredible thing. It reminds us that as we stand on the cusp of unprecedented, scientific and technological change  of amazing discoveries that were once unimaginable breakthroughs, we cannot forget that real lives and real people are at the heart and the reason for all that we do. There is always a child, a son, a daughter, a husband, a wife, a loved one in pain summoning all the courage they can, sustained by hope that a cure will be there for them. And everyone else who is and may be in their shoes thinks the same way. And the truth is that today  more than any point in human history  we have a genuine opportunity to help more people across the world than ever before. And thats our obligation. And when we think about the promise measured against the need, every minute of every day matters. And I know every one of you understand that. From my perspective thats why were here. In a sense I may be the most  least qualified person to speak here today. I am not a researcher. Im not an oncologist. Im not a geneticist. Im a Vice President of the United States. But Ive been on the other end of the need. But thats what I want to talk to you about today. For hundreds of years humankind has tried to deal with and fight and cure cancer. In the United States nearly 50 years ago, President Richard M. Nixon announced for the first time in America history, a war on cancer. Since then weve spent billions of dollars. And thousands of researchers and scientists and doctors and medical centers and government agencies, philanthropists have all worked with the singular focus of trying to defeat or at least slow cancer. Weve made progress worldwide in prevention with campaigns to end smoking, increasing cancer screenings, and the emergence of vaccines, the final epiphany of understanding that our personal habits and our physical environment  cleaner air and cleaner water  probably hold a greater promise than any single thing we could do to prevent cancer. Weve made progress in treating some cancers  some better than others like lymphoma. Cancer-related death rates are down 23 percent over 20 years. But they havent declined enough. And we have to ask ourselves, why havent we made more progress? Its expected that the world will see almost 20 million new cases of cancer, and 11.4 additional million cancer deaths by 2025. So the question  among others  that brings us here today is: How can we prevent that from happening? My regret is that I was in Iraq the last couple days and not sitting here absorbing, listening to, taking in the presentations made by some of the most brilliant minds in the world who are assembled here today and over the last several days and who are finding the answer. The answer is clear that in science for the first time we are more ready, and technology is here. And our capacity to connect with each of them around the world holds greater hope than ever existed. So when I called for a Cancer Moonshot  and the President almost wished we hadnt used the word moonshot. It generates comments about the phrase moonshot. But when I walked into the Rose Garden off the White House with the President back in October to announce I wasnt running for President of the United States, I said the one regret I have I wish I could have been the President of the United States that presided over a fundamental change in the effort to cure and/or turn some cancers into chronic diseases. I knew this time is different from previous efforts. Many of the parents who are here  or families that are here  you learn to become an expert very quickly when someone you adore is in serious difficulty. Or as my mother, Jean Finnegan Biden, would say, Joey, a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing. But you try to absorb as much as you can about the disease that that person who shares your soul is fighting. And because I had access to one of the great cancer research hospitals in the world  MD Anderson  and others, I had a chance to talk to the worlds top cancer researchers, scientists, philanthropists. And I learned its really within the last four to five years that science and the medicine of cancer have reached an inflection point that is almost brand new. We hadnt been here before. Just five years ago, oncologists werent working with immunologists, virologists, geneticists, chemical, and biological engineers and so many other disciplines. I didnt realize that immunology was thought of as sort of a voodoo science 15 years ago. Im being a bit facetious. But this is the first time in history all these disciplines are now beginning to work closer and closer together and holding enormous promise. And today coalitions of cancer organizations are aggregating genomics, patients records, families history, lifestyles using super computers to find answers that we dont have right now. Date technology firms with whom Ive met, the largest in the world, are converting data into machine-readable formats, making it more accessible to researchers and discovering new patterns that could deliver real results for patients  not unlike mapping the stars. And the world is taking note of all of you assembled here in this hall and your collaboration, because its relatively new. Ive had the great privilege, because of my job, to meet with world leaders who want to work together on the process. Im told a member of the royal family of the UAE is here. When I met with Mohammed bin Zayed recently, I went to talk about how we deal with Daesh and ISIL. As youll recall, the discussion was, lets talk about cancer. How can we generate a memorandum of understanding between our countries? The same thing is going on when I go to Israel. Im meeting with President Abe, of Japan; President Park, of South Korea. The number of world leaders that have contacted me that want to collaborate and work together. They sense exactly what we sense  the enormous possibilities. Philanthropists from around the world are investing billions of their money in this fight, and you see it here. Ten years ago regenerative medicine was a dream. Today its a reality. Look at this conference. The Pontifical Council for Culture is bringing the world together to deliver breakthrough therapies and improve care for people all around the world. And Im grateful. But the point is that so much has changed, there is so much more hope, and I might add such higher expectation, the community at large. But while governments can do a great deal, this is not the work of one government, or government itself. Theres an overwhelming need for a public-private partnership to bring together all of the human and financial and knowledge resources at our disposal to make a quantum leap. Our goal in the United States is to do within the next five years what would otherwise take a decade. But thats the work of all of us. And today Im calling on  Im calling for an international commitment grounded on a few basic principles. Vice President Joe Biden delivers remarks at the Vaticans International Conference on Regenerative Medicine, Vatican City, April 29, 2016. (Official White House Photo by David Lienemann) Ive traveled the United States over the last six months visiting with over 290 oncologists, going to 10 of our greatest cancer research centers, meeting with drug companies, meeting with big data firms. Certain things have emerged, and I am not a medical expert. But I have spent my life trying to solve complicated problems and entities that do not talk to one another. The first principle I think we could adopt is to focus on prevention, access, and affordability around the world. Nearly 50 percent of all cancers are preventable. Take cervical cancer  530,000 new cases are diagnosed each year; 270,000 people die each year; 87 percent in developing countries. In Africa, its the second most common cancer after breast cancer. Its a travesty. But its fully preventable with basic education, screening, and vaccines. We have a greater global combination  to coordinate  we need greater global coordination to promote healthier lifestyles that prevent cancers like it. We need gender  we need greater coordination to reduce environmental causes of other forms of deadly but preventable cancers. We also have to increase access to treatment. Even in the United States of America, a developed country, access to care is not what it should be. Less than 5 percent of all cancer patients wind up in a clinical trial. Seventy-percent of cancer patients are treated by community oncologists  good, qualified men and women, but who dont have access to the treatment trials and expertise available to Americas great cancer institutes. And treatments have to be affordable. The best medicine and treatment cant belong only to the privileged and the powerful. It has to belong to everyone. The second principle is the international response to cancer should reflect the same urgency we bring to infectious disease threats. Cancer is the constant emergency. In the United States alone we lose more than 1,600* people a day to cancer. We should be doing everything possible to accelerate cancer treatments and cures with urgency. We should be sharing data the moment its published  immediately. Not hiding it behind pay walls that prevent information from being shared for a year or more. We just dealt with the Hubble Telescope, with a new technology that was found to how to better  have more accuracy in the pictures; stuff of which could have national security implications. It was made available to world immediately. Immediately. Why do you wait? What is your rationale? Creating faster grant and review cycles so the best minds in the world can work on the hardest problems in cancer as soon as possible. We should build up the capacity of the civil societies to fill gaps of care, and screening, preventing, treatment in cervical and breast cancers, and oral cancers  especially in hard-to-reach places around the world. Its within our power. Vice President Joe Biden meets with Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Secretary of State, at the Apostolic Palace, in Vatican City, April 29, 2016.

12357,The Dolphin Rape Myth,"Google the term dolphin rape and youll find countless references to male dolphins raping female dolphins, males raping other males, gang rape, and even dolphins raping humans. You might even find this hoax webpage claiming that dolphins regularly kidnap swimmers and take them to a rape cave. Head over to Google Scholar, however, and you will find exactly zero references to dolphin rape in the scientific peer-reviewed literature. The reason for this discrepancy is quite simple: the term rape cannot be used to describe the kinds of behavior scientists have observed in dolphins. The central problem is that the legal definitions of rape include a lack of consent on the part of the victim, and we simply cannot know the extent to which dolphins or other animals are able to give consent. A non-consensual act like rape has moral and legal implications that are only relevant in the human world, which is why animal scientists (pretty much) stopped using the term altogether in the early 1980s. The correct scientific term to describe when a male aggressively restrains a female in order to mate is forced copulation. Forced copulation has been observed in ducks, lizards, monkeys, fruit flies, crickets, orangutans, chimpanzees, and countless other species. But not dolphins. Despite the media frenzy around the idea of dolphin rape, its primates, birds and insects that are the forced copulation aficionados, not dolphins. What follows is a brief rundown of all of the aggressive sexual behaviors that scientists have observed in dolphins that often find their way into popular reports discussing dolphin rape: Sexual Coercion: Sexual Coercion is a term describing a suite of behaviors observed most frequently in the bottlenose dolphins of Shark Bay Australia and Sarasota Bay Florida. Individuals or groups of males use a variety of coercive tactics to increase their chances of mating with females. In Shark Bay, groups of male dolphins are often seen in the company of an individual female for extended periods of time (referred to as a consortship). Sometimes these males begin the consortship by herding (i.e., chasing and corralling) the female, although other times the female appears to enter the consortship willingly. These males sometimes use aggressive behavior to keep the female close to them and to fend off rival males, and its during these consortships that mating takes place. In Sarasota, males also follow females around when its time to mate (a form of mate guarding), but rarely engage in aggressive behavior directed at the female like in Shark Bay. Dolphins might use other tactics to persuade a female to mate with them, including committing infanticide (i.e., killing calves) so that the females will come into estrus and be more receptive. But heres the thing: even in the clearly aggressive coercion scenarios witnessed in Shark Bay, researchers have never witnessed forced copulation. The kind of coercion being described here is indirect in that these tactics ultimately result in males persuading females to mate with them, but not directly forcing themselves on the females. The scientific experts studying the Shark Bay dolphins had this to say about forced copulation in a recent book: We have no evidence of direct sexual coercion in dolphins, including forced copulation or other behaviors directly associated with male attempts to mate. In other words, if forced copulation should be considered the non-human animal equivalent to rape insofar as it appears (to the human observer) as if the female has not given consent, then this still has never been observed in dolphins. This fact alone is a strong argument against the use of the word rape to describe any dolphin mating strategies. Socio-Sexual behavior: The below video has been mislabeled as Dolphins Mating, and purportedly shows two males and one female dolphin. In fact, there are three male dolphins in this video. This group of young males is engaging in what scientists call socio-sexual behavior. This is a blanket term that describes any social behavior involving penises that does not involve a male trying to impregnate a female. Sometimes the dolphins simply rub all over each other while brandishing erections, and sometimes they actually insert their penises in each others anuses or genital slits. Unlike true mating, which usually take the form of the male swimming belly-to-belly underneath a female, socio-sexual behavior often involves the male approaching the other dolphin (male or female) from behind or the side. Sometimes it looks rather brutal and aggressive, and sometimes, like in the below video, the animals seem pretty chill. There are a variety of reasons dolphins engage in these behaviors, ranging from establishing or maintaining social bonds and friendships, to blowing off steam, punishing rivals, or simply having a grand old time. Its difficult to know exactly what is going through the dolphins minds when watching socio-sexual behavior unfold, and whether or not any of the observed penile penetration is consensual. Regardless, it does not resemble forced copulation. Mounting: You can easily find examples online of dolphins with erections and thrusting behavior directed at human swimmers (like here, and here). Its impossible to know if penetration is their intention (i.e., some form of penetration being another criterion in the definition of human rape), or if its the dolphin equivalent of a dog humping your leg. Mounting behavior (which does not always involve penetration, especially since females sometime do the mounting) has been studied in a number of animal species, and the list of proposed functions for this behavior is diverse: play behavior, solidifying maternal bonds, dominance, aggression, establishment and maintenance of social bonds, conflict resolution, and of course sexual gratification. Mounting behavior in dolphins is widespread and is a form of socio-sexual behavior. It involves dolphins of all ages and both sexes. Juveniles and calves will sometimes mount their mothers (and vice versa) and females will mount males. Despite documented mounting attempts involving dolphins and humans, I have found no verified accounts of a male dolphin having ever penetrated a human orifice with his penis (against their will or otherwise). So heres the bottom line: calling any of this behavior rape trivializes the word rape. It either downplays the horrific human behavior of rape by jokingly misapplying it to quirky animal behavior, or unnecessarily vilifies what is, for dolphins, a diverse catalog of behaviors that might not cause the dolphins involved very much stress, and might even be consensual 100% of the time. In most cases involving male dolphins using aggressive strategies to mate with females, the correct term is sexual coercion, which is NOT synonymous with rape. Unlike rape, sexual coercion might involve consent on the part of the female, and involves many indirect coercive behaviors (e.g., herding, infanticide), and not just forced copulation. In any event, forced copulation as a sexual coercion technique has never been observed in dolphins. In cases where males are directing their penises at the bodies and orifices of other dolphins where reproduction is not the goal, or engage in mounting behavior, the correct term is probably socio-sexual behavior. Again, socio-sexual behavior might involve consent, and does not always involve penetration or forced copulation. The dolphins are rapists meme easily lends itself to being a trendy t-shirt, or link-bait headline, but rape is undoubtedly the wrong term to apply to dolphin behavior. It is a loaded term that really should be used solely to describe the fundamentally horrific, and uniquely human crime of rape as defined by the law. There is no dolphin equivalent. *************** Further reading on sexual coercion and socio-sexual behavior in dolphins: Connor R.C., Vollmer N. 2009.

13263,"6 things Bernie Sanders would do to crack down on fracking, even if Congress doesnt go along","Bernie Sanders wants to halt fracking not just on public land but on private land too. How would he actually do that? Grist talked to the Sanders campaign to get previously unreleased specifics about the kinds of strategies he would use if he makes it to the Oval Office. Sanders hasnt proposed eliminating conventional oil and gas drilling or coal mining on private land, but he believes that hydraulic fracturing, AKA fracking, is especially problematic. It involves injecting secret chemical brews at high pressure deep into the earth to unleash previously inaccessible deposits of gas and oil, a process that can contaminate local air and water and even cause earthquakes. Sanders recently called for passing a law that would dramatically scale back fracking on private land by closing the so-called Halliburton loophole that exempts fracking operations from the Safe Drinking Water Act. That change would allow EPA to regulate whats in fracking fluids and how they are used. But, like so many of Sanders proposals, this anti-fracking measure would stand no chance of passing Congress, as the House is sure to stay in Republican hands and the Senate might too. Sanders didnt publicly offer a list of backup plans for cracking down on fracking through executive action, so Grist asked his campaign what he would do about fracking if Congress wouldnt pass his bill. The campaign offered up a number of policy proposals a president could enact on his or her own, geared around these basic principles: stop letting fracking operations pollute their neighbors air and water, and stop incentivizing a switch in the energy sector from coal to natural gas. Instead of embracing gas as a supposedly cleaner bridge fuel, Sanders wants to go straight to renewables. Here are the six most significant executive actions that a President Sanders would likely take to put the squeeze on fracking and natural gas: Change the Clean Power Plan to incentivize renewables instead of gas. The biggest problem with Obamas signature climate initiative is that it is structured in such a way as to encourage states to shift their power plants from burning coal to gas. It also encourages switching to renewable energy, of course, and during the first two years EPA will provide states with emissions credits specifically for certain renewable investments such as wind and solar projects in low-income communities, through whats called the Clean Energy Incentive Program. Sanders would extend that program through the CPPs lifetime, all the way to 2030. Regulate methane, not just carbon, through the Clean Power Plan. One of the reasons the CPP implicitly favors gas is that it only measures and regulates carbon dioxide emissions, which come from a power plants smokestack when a fossil fuel is burned. By that measure, gas is only half as bad as coal. But when natural gas is extracted through fracking and piped to power plants, methane leaks out, a greenhouse gas thats 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide over 20 years. So much methane leaks through that studies suggest it totally wipes out the climate advantage of gas over coal. Extending the CPP to cover methane would mean that natural gas is properly assessed for its climate impact. Use the Clean Air Act to regulate methane leakage from existing sources and strengthen rules on new sources. Last year, EPA proposed regulation of methane leakage from new sources, such as wells and pipelines. But the vast majority of methane leakage comes from existing sources, so Sanders would have EPA regulate them as well. Sanders also wants to make the EPAs rules for new sources more stringent. Regulate containment of fracking fluid under the Clean Water Act. The fluids injected into the earth in fracking operations dont just stay down there, they come back up. Typically, they are poured into containment ponds, which can be exposed to the open air and overflow in storms, leak through holes, and so on. Under Sanders, EPA would create rules for safer containment of used fracking fluid. Investigate the effects of fracking. EPA has abandoned its studies of the risks of water contamination from fracking. Sanders staffers say that under his presidency, the agency would carefully study the effects of fracking and publicize the results. Support state and local efforts to ban fracking. The power of the presidents bully pulpit to exhort people to do what he or she wants can be overstated. But if the president publicly highlights the dangers of fracking, praising state and local governments that have banned fracking and encouraging others to follow their lead, it might help at the margins. These moves would serve the same basic purpose: stop letting natural gas be artificially cheap by sticking the rest of society with the cost for water, air, and climate pollution. By limiting that pollution and requiring gas companies to spend more money on protecting surrounding communities, Sanders would raise the cost of fracking and the gas and oil it produces. You impact the market through regulatory authority, says one Sanders aide. Its good to know that the Sanders team has these pragmatic plans for grinding out small-bore victories if their wholesale political revolution doesnt come to pass. Sanders skyrocketed from obscurity to winning the New Hampshire primary largely on the strength of his idealistic legislative proposals like a $15-per-hour minimum wage. His climate and environment proposals are idealistic too. In December, Sanders released an impressive climate action plan that is based heavily on bills that would have to be passed through Congress  and wont be passed any time soon without a massive partisan and ideological swing in its membership. Sanders cant be blamed for talking mainly about his dream legislation. Everyone else does it too. Its not like a Republican Congress would pass Hillary Clintons more modest proposals, or a Senate in which Democrats can filibuster would pass Donald Trumps massive tax cuts. This is how presidential candidates campaign. Much as it may irritate wonks, most voters want to hear a candidates big, unrealistic proposals because it tells them what that person believes in and the direction he or she would take the country. The question is whether a candidate can also offer concrete policies that are actually achievable. On fracking, Sanders is now showing that he can.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/10/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-bernie-sanders-wants-delay-cl/,Science,Polifact
14770,Sheldon Whitehouse: Climate change in a tsunami of denial,"Climate change denial is a castle built on sand. Its collapse is inevitable. The question is, can we get real in time to avert the worst damage to our beautiful Ocean State? To do that, we need to enact... Climate change denial is a castle built on sand. Its collapse is inevitable. The question is, can we get real in time to avert the worst damage to our beautiful Ocean State? To do that, we need to enact a nationwide price on carbon pollution to make the market work properly and discourage dumping carbon into our atmosphere. Heres why I think we can. First, the days of free carbon pollution end this June, when the Obama administration announces regulations on the biggest emitters. That wont just lower the polluters emissions, it will change their thinking. When their free-pollution holiday is over, a nationwide carbon fee may start to look better to them. Second, the polluters have had a political field day since the Citizens United decision allowed unlimited dark money into our elections  what one newspaper called the tsunami of slime. That one-sided assault is coming to an end as environmental money begins to match the polluters in elections. The environmental money will still be less, but it has the advantage of a truthful message. Third, major brand-name corporations like Walmart, General Motors, Coca-Cola, Apple, Mars and many others have terrific climate policies. They just havent all put their communications or government relations effort in line with their sustainability work. The military gets how serious this is and has listed climate change as a national security threat; commander of the U.S. Pacific Command Adm. Samuel Lochlear has said its our worst threat in the Pacific Theater. When these voices are heard more clearly it will be devastating to the denier apparatus. Fourth, the denier apparatus is a phony: front organizations designed to look like theyre real; bogus messages designed to sound like theyre truthful; a whole big charade connected to and funded by polluters. Phonies dont last. Most important, the climate deniers have lost the public. Independents and Democrats overwhelmingly support action on climate change, and most Republican voters under 35 in a recent poll said climate deniers are ignorant, out of touch, or crazy. Republican mayors and governors, away from the polluter money choking Congress, are getting to work on climate change. Republican economists support a carbon tax. Republicans increasingly see they cannot possibly win the 2016 presidential race with a denier candidate. Before Citizens United, many Republican senators were working on and voting for climate legislation. Republican friends in the Senate have complained to me that the polluter money attacks Republicans in primaries, not just Democrats in general elections. The polluters, post-Citizens United, have run a coal-fired purge of the Republican Party in Congress. But even vast polluter money can only bully them quiet for so long  and when compliance is imposed by fear, disruptions are abrupt. When the denial castle collapses, the prospects for a serious carbon bill in Congress are good. The revenues from a revenue-neutral carbon fee are all returned to the public, and there are appealing ways to do that: lowering corporate tax rates from 35 to 30 percent would be a huge value to good corporate citizens such as CVS and its consumers; giving seniors on Social Security a raise, or students (and their parents) relief on college loans would please many Rhode Islanders; a straight-out check to heads of households would be possible. There are already more American jobs in the solar industry than in coal mining, and were near tipping points where solar is the cheaper power even ignoring the extra harm done by carbon pollution. America has a prosperous clean energy future to look forward to, and theres more economic security in our own American know-how than in corrupt foreign fossil fuel countries. More than anything, as an optimist, I believe this will get done because it must. April was the first month in human history with consistently more than 400 parts per million of carbon in the atmosphere (for at least 8,000 centuries its been between 175 and 300 ppm). Sea level at the tide gauge off the Newport Navy base is up about 10 inches since the Hurricane of 1938, because warming seas expand (and swallow our beaches). Our orchards are seeing unaccustomed winter blooms, which are very risky, if a hard cold snap follows  ask the Michigan cherry industry. Our commercial fishermen see fish in Rhode Island Sound like tarpon and grouper that their fathers never saw, and have lost important fisheries like the winter flounder; lobster are moving offshore to cooler waters; as one fisherman said to me, Its getting weird out there. Rainbursts now cause 100-year flooding every few years  even 500-year flooding in Cranston three years ago. Rhode Islands first summer residents were Southern traders, come to avoid the fetid Carolina heat; now that heat is marching northward to become our summers. And dont be misled, the links connecting these results to carbon pollution are forged in immutable laws of science and nature. We simply have to get this right. Rhode Island has too much at stake to fail.

15106,Benz Patent Motor Car: The first automobile  | Daimler,"The first stationary gasoline engine developed by Carl Benz was a one-cylinder two-stroke unit which ran for the first time on New Years Eve 1879. Benz had so much commercial success with this engine that he was able to devote more time to his dream of creating a lightweight car powered by a gasoline engine, in which the chassis and engine formed a single unit. The major features of the two-seater vehicle, which was completed in 1885, were the compact high-speed single-cylinder four-stroke engine installed horizontally at the rear, the tubular steel frame, the differential and three wire-spoked wheels. The engine output was 0.75 hp (0.55 kW). Details included an automatic intake slide, a controlled exhaust valve, high-voltage electrical vibrator ignition with spark plug, and water/thermo siphon evaporation cooling. On January 29, 1886, Carl Benz applied for a patent for his vehicle powered by a gas engine. The patent  number 37435  may be regarded as the birth certificate of the automobile. In July 1886 the newspapers reported on the first public outing of the three-wheeled Benz Patent Motor Car, model no. 1. Using an improved version and without her husbands knowledge, Benzs wife Bertha and their two sons Eugen (15) and Richard (14) embarked on the first long-distance journey in automotive history on an August day in 1888. The route included a few detours and took them from Mannheim to Pforzheim, her place of birth. With this journey of 180 kilometers including the return trip Bertha Benz demonstrated the practicality of the motor vehicle to the entire world. Without her daring  and that of her sons  and the decisive stimuli that resulted from it, the subsequent growth of Benz & Cie. in Mannheim to become the worlds largest automobile plant of its day would have been unthinkable. Double-pivot steering, contra engine, planetary gear transmission (1891  1897) Double-pivot steering It was Carl Benz who had the double-pivot steering system patented in 1893, thereby solving one of the most urgent problems of the automobile. The first Benz with this steering system was the three-hp (2.2-kW) Victoria in 1893, of which slightly larger numbers with different bodies were built. The worlds first production car with some 1200 units built was the Benz Velo of 1894, a lightweight, durable and inexpensive compact car. 1897 saw the development of the twin engine consisting of two horizontal single-cylinder units in parallel, however this proved unsatisfactory. It was immediately followed by a better design, the contra engine in which the cylinders were arranged opposite each other. This was the birth of the horizontally-opposed piston engine. Always installed at the rear by Benz until 1900, this unit generated up to 16 hp (12 kW) in various versions.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/13/laura-ingraham/did-americans-invent-car-ingraham-says-so/,Science,Polifact
16156,Heidi Heilman: Marijuana follows Big Tobaccos lead,"WESTBOROUGH, Mass.Science and public health should inform drug policy decisions  not public opinion and a national campaign funded by a giant industry that sells an addictive, psychotropic drug. Its... WESTBOROUGH, Mass. Science and public health should inform drug policy decisions  not public opinion and a national campaign funded by a giant industry that sells an addictive, psychotropic drug. Its depressing that Rhode Island Rep. Edith H. Ajello and Sen. Joshua Miller are promoting legalization by using the exact talking points of the multimillion-dollar, pro-marijuana lobby. The science is clear: marijuana use has been linked to mental illness, depression, psychosis, permanent loss of IQ and memory, heightened risk of heart attack or stroke, likelihood of dropping out of school, addiction to other drugs and testicular cancer. Big Marijuana is doing all it can to cast doubt on these scientific facts in the same way that Big Tobacco succeeded in hiding the dangers of cigarette smoking for more than 80 years. A growing body of research is showing how the cannabinoid system and the opioid system of the brain are intimately connected. Modifying one modifies the other. Surely, it is no coincidence that Vermont and New Hampshire, both medical marijuana states, and both at the top of the list for youth marijuana rates in this country (Vermont is number one; New Hampshire is number two), also have soaring rates of opiate and heroin use. Not all pot smokers move to heroin, but if they start in their teen years, the risk of evolving to opiate and/or heroin addiction is significantly increased. New Hampshires heroin deaths have doubled this year. In February, the Denver Post reported that Colorado ski towns are experiencing an unprecedented spike in heroin deaths and abuse, and rates in the Rocky Mountain State are at their highest in a decade. Boulder is burdened with serious issues of street violence and homelessness  direct outcomes of marijuana legalization that dont seem to be reaching New Englands newspapers. Todays marijuana is 300 percent to 800 percent more potent than the pot of yesteryear. Such dangerous levels of THC heighten mental illness and addiction risks for those who smoke marijuana  especially for kids with developing brains. Research is clear that the teen brain is primed for chemical dependency: One in six of those who use marijuana before age 18 become addicted. For the big business of marijuana, this is basic market research. Like the tobacco industry, it must hook the underage population with really high-grade, potent stuff. The demand for addictive products increases when they are legal, easily accessible and aggressively marketed. Data shows 52 percent of the U.S. public uses alcohol, a legal drug, and 7.3 percent uses marijuana, an illegal drug. What happens if we legalize marijuana and use rises to 25 percent, 35 percent or 50 percent? Open up the psych wards, treatment centers and assisted living beds, America, and watch your social and public school costs soar. When half the country is smoking pot, the rest of us will be pulling a wagon full of people dazed in a psychiatric haze of smoke. Legalization is not the solution to incarceration, as Representative Ajello and Senator Miller claim. Sentencing reform that leads to treatment, recovery and strong supports is the better alternative and will yield a more healthy, productive populace. We must focus on practical changes in marijuana policy that neither demonize users nor legalize the drug. Through sound measures, we can reduce incarceration and marijuana rates. Big Tobacco kept the public in the dark for a half century by clouding evidence that smoking caused lung cancer. It was strategic and it was effective. Smoking remains the number one cause of preventable death, killing 5 million people per year. Big Marijuana is following the same playbook  clouding evidence of harm. As the industry takes root, expect big tobacco companies to take over. A 1970s tobacco industry report on marijuana states, We have the land to grow it, the technology to mass produce it, and the distribution to market it. Just three years ago, in Indonesia, cigarettes were legally sold to children of any age and advertisements saturated the media, associating smoking with independence, sex, adventure and youth. During an interview with Vanguard, Ita Rahma, a young tobacco control activist, referred to tobacco as Indonesias smelly fish, explaining, we have a saying: when you hide a smelly fish, you cant hide it forever because the smell will come out eventually. Marijuana is being positioned as harmless, and the emerging industry is luring in our youth. Marijuana is now Americas smelly fish and more and more of us are starting to pick up the stench.

17920,The Committee on Energy and Commerce,"Barton: Medicare Drug Program Drawing Participants by the Thousands WASHINGTON - U.S. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, made the following statement today during the full committee hearing on the Administration's FY '07 Health Care Priorities: ""Good afternoon. Let me begin by welcoming Secretary Michael Leavitt today to the Energy and Commerce Committee. We look forward to hearing him testify about the Administration's Fiscal Year 2007 Health Care Priorities. ""First, Mr. Secretary, I want to thank you for your assistance in developing the important reforms we put into place for the Medicaid program starting this year. As a former governor yourself, you understood and appreciated the need to improve this program. Through passage of the Deficit Reduction Act, we will sustain Medicaid for those people who most often need health care and to get good get their health care through good jobs in a thriving economy instead of from a government welfare program. The reforms we adopted recently are beginning to rescue the program from the threat of financial collapse. I look forward to working with you to see that the governors get the tools they need to better manage the program and deliver its benefits to the poor of their states. ""I want to briefly highlight at least some of the changes in the law that have not recently received the public attention that they deserve. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 115,000 disabled children covered by the Family Opportunity Act will receive improved health care services as a result of the recently passed Deficit Reduction Act. The new law will provide access to new home and community based care to 120,000 individuals; and it will facilitate 100,000 nursing home residents to return to their communities through the Administration's Money Follows the Person Demonstration. These are the true results of Medicaid reform - better access to better care for those who most need our assistance. ""There is still much to be done to improve long-term care service delivery and financing as well as to promote Medicaid managed care. I have received the administration's proposals regarding additional improvement to the Medicaid program and I look forward to working with you this year on them. ""This year the secretary and the administration also are required to administer the new Medicare prescription drug benefit. Making this program succeed is a high priority of yours, and it is a high priority of this committee that I chair. ""Since it began, critics have tried to make patients believe that they are not smart enough to understand the new Medicare drug benefit, that it provides inadequate coverage, and that signing up isn't worth their time because it cannot save them any money. The critics are simply wrong. They were wrong when they complained about the Medicare prescription drug card. They were wrong when they said nobody would offer any insurance plans. And they are wrong now. ""Some sense political advantage in condemning the program and others can't bring themselves to admit that free markets actually work. Transparency and competition will drive down prices and provide lower costs to consumers. Even if the critics don't get it, Medicare beneficiaries certainly do. That is why over 3.6 million Medicare beneficiaries have already signed up for the new benefit. You told me earlier today that there are close to 24 million Americans that have been enrolled in the program, through one means or another, and enrollment is increasing at approximately 250,000 people per week. That sounds like a success story to me. If you add that to the fact that the premiums which we estimated at $37 a month is now down to an average $27 per month, that appears to me to be a successful program. ""This is a huge undertaking and there are going to be glitches. My goal is the same as yours: Get rid of the glitches. The committee will work closely with yourself and Dr. Mark McClellan at CMS to get problems noticed and solved. We will have the first of what will likely be several hearings on this topic on March 1, when Dr. McClellan will testify before the Health subcommittee. I expect that we ask him very direct questions about where the problems are and what CMS is doing to fix them. ""Another high priority for the committee will be the reauthorization of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and related programs. I want to restate my deep commitment to reauthorizing the NIH and would ask for the secretary's assistance in working out the technical details so that we can enact this long overdue legislation. In addition, the authorization for the Ryan White CARE Act has now lapsed. I believe that funding unauthorized programs is not a responsible practice, and I anticipate that the committee will work to reauthorize these programs this year. ""I also intend to work with you this year on ways to reform Medicare reimbursement, and particularly focus on physician payment reform. In order to preserve access to Medicare services for future generations, we must look at how we are spending our Medicare dollars today and what are the incentives are for our physician community to continue providing quality health care. ""Another top priority of the committee will be to work with you on the proposals outlined in the Administration's budget to provide consumers with greater access to comparative price and quality data about their health care providers. I could go on, but my time has expired."" ####",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/13/steve-israel/medicare-part-d-and-obamacare-health-care-gov/,Science,Polifact
18128,Congressman Lashes Out in Obamacare Hearing: This Is a 'Monkey Court!',"Not only that, but the language, as detailed by the conservative Weekly Standard, is itself commented out. Developers will occasionally put marks around lines of code telling the computer, in essence, ""ignore this."" (Why? Often developers will leave notes like ""// Section two begins here"" to make code easier to scan.) In this case, the language was likely commented out because the document, a fairly standard ""Terms and Conditions"" page, was repurposed form another project. Take standard legal language, comment out the parts you won't use, and done. (Update: Expert Clay Johnson suggests that the use of a template is exactly what happened. It wasn't commented out, though  just never activated by the code to appear.) Barton is also confusing two types of privacy: the privacy afforded under HIPAA (discussed below) and the privacy that is necessary for online communication. Earlier this year, Google came under fire when it was reported that its attorneys argued that GMail users didn't have a reasonable expectation of privacy. As The Verge pointed out, this is a fairly common legal stipulation that allows online companies to process information submitted online. When you send your emails to Google, you acknowledge that Google has a right to see who sent the message and where it's going, and so on. It would be hard to maintain that information privately and have your email get to its destination! The language commented out in the source code of one page of Healthcare.gov is almost certainly similar in its intent. The witness from CGI Federal mentioned none of this. When Barton wrapped up, Pallone jumped in. First, he pointed out that there was no legal violation. Pallone: I started out in my opening statement saying there was no legitimacy to this hearing and the last line of the questioning certainly confirms is that. HIPAA only applies when there's health information being provided. That's not in play here today. No health information is required in the application process. And why is that? Because pre-existing conditions don't matter! So once again, here we have my Republican colleagues trying to scare everybody  Barton, interrupting: If the gentleman will yield? Pallone: No, I will not yield to this monkey court or whatever  Barton: This is not a monkey court! Pallone's point is valid: There is no personal health information submitted to the Healthcare.gov site  though other personal information is. One of the problems with Healthcare.gov is that it is complex, has a large number of interlocking parts. Barton's critique identified one of the little bits of messiness that, at its heart, is unimportant. But given the contentiousness of the debate over Obamacare  again on display on Thursday  that line of attack might spread. Photo: Barton in 2010.

19286,Interview With President Obama,"So the entire intention of the speech is to make sure that we are focused on the right thing. It doesnt mean that I expect Republicans to agree with all my prescriptions, but it is to say that the central problem we face and the one that we faced now that the immediate crisis is over is how do we build a broad-based prosperity. And I want to make sure that all of us in Washington are investing as much time, as much energy, as much debate on how we grow the economy and grow the middle class as weve spent over the last two to three years arguing about how we reduce the deficits. NYT: But do you worry, Mr. President, that that description of that sort of standing pat, what happens if you stand pat and the sort of slower than expected -- do you worry that that could end up being your legacy simply because of the obstruction that -- and the gridlock that doesnt seem to end? MR. OBAMA: Well, lets separate it from me for a second, because I think if Im arguing for entirely different policies and Congress ends up pursuing policies that I think dont make sense and we get a bad result, its hard to argue thatd be my legacy. And so Ill worry about my legacy later or Ill let historians worry about my legacy. I do worry about whats happening to ordinary families here is Galesburg and all across the country. When we know that rebuilding our infrastructure right now would put people back to work and its never been cheaper for us to do so, and this is all deferred maintenance that were going to have to do at some point anyway, I worry that were not moving faster to seize the moment. When we know that families are getting killed by college costs, for us not to take bold action -- which means that young people are graduating with massive debt, they cant buy a home as soon as they want, they cant start that business that theyve got a great idea for -- that worries me. So as I suggested in the speech, what I want to make sure everybody in Washington is obsessed with is how are we growing the economy, how are we increasing middle-class incomes and middle-class wages, and increasing middle-class security. And if were not talking about that, then were talking about the wrong thing. And if our debates around the budget dont have that in mind, then weve got the wrong focus. NYT: Well, you said it yourself in the speech that Washington has taken its eye off the ball. Do you have any -- are you culpable at all in that? Did you -- its six -- its July now, its almost August. Do you wish you were giving a speech like this earlier and done it more often? Advertisement Continue reading the main story MR. OBAMA: If you look over the last six months, we right away delivered on the promise to make sure that our tax code was more reflective of our values; that middle-class families locked in relief that they needed; folks like me, at the very top, paid a little bit more. That, by the way, was a fundamental shift that was a decade in the making. That was a big argument. Immediately after that, obviously, we had the tragedy in Newtown and the need for a response. And my wish and hope had been that that was a quicker piece of business and that we had gone ahead and moved forward on that. Immigration reform actually squarely fits into what Im discussing right now. As I indicated before, we know the economy will grow faster if we get immigration reform done. We know that Social Security will be shored up if we get immigration reform done. And the Senates done the right thing by passing a strong bipartisan bill. So what I will absolutely admit to is that Ive been here  Ive been in Washington long enough now to know that if once a week Im not talking about jobs, the economy, and the middle class, then all manner of distraction fills the void. NYT: Is there any part of your agenda moving forward that you think you are willing to move to the backburner so that you can spend more time on the economy? MR. OBAMA: Well, immigration reform weve got to get done, and that right now is just a matter of the House Republicans recognizing that both the American people, businesses, labor, evangelicals -- theres a broad consensus to go ahead and pass that bill, and if that bill was on the floor tomorrow it would pass. Beyond that, though, were working on a range of other issues -- from climate change to reforming government to reducing the backlog in the VA. So theres a bunch of stuff were going to be doing. I will be spending my time over the next several weeks talking about the issues in more detail that I discussed today so that by the time Congress gets back in the fall, I want to make sure that the American people are paying attention and asking themselves, are we doing everything we can to boost middle-class incomes, ladders of opportunity, and middle-class security. Advertisement Continue reading the main story And if were doing that, then ultimately I think that we wont get everything done that I want to see done, but we will have shifted away from what I think has been a bad  a damaging framework in Washington, which is to constantly think about is there more we can do to cut the deficit without asking are we making the right cuts, the smart cuts that actually help people in their own lives and help us grow over the long term. NYT: Well, in contrast with the jobs plan thats now what youre reflecting today, its almost two years old now, and which would measurably add to employment the studies show. MR. OBAMA: Right. NYT: But in contrast with that, the policies that have been in place since the start of your second term, fiscal policies -- MR. OBAMA: Right, because of the sequester. NYT: -- that you and Congress agreed to -- right -- and some of the laws -- the payroll tax cut, and the increase in upper-end taxes to some extent -- but all of those things are by any economists measure a drag on the economy. Theres not a day goes by I dont get some analyst saying that -- and that the Fed is pursuing expansionary policies to offset that. How can you -- how are you going to -- what exactly can you do between now and the end of the year to overcome the Republicans opposition and change that, to end sequester? MR. OBAMA: Well, let me back up, Jackie. First of all, as the economy got stronger during the course of my presidency, I had always committed to a responsible reduction in the deficit. I think that was the smart thing to do, the right thing to do, and good for our growth. And if were growing faster, if businesses and the markets have more confidence, then ultimately that benefits middle-class families as well. So I make no apologies for putting forward budgets consistently that, as I had promised, would gradually reduce the deficit. Now, the sequester I did not want to be in place. When you say I agreed to it, what happened, as you will recall, in 2011 is, is that we had the prospect of either default or a willingness on the part of Republicans and Democrats to spend a year and a half trying to come up with a sensible way to reduce the deficit. The sequester was supposed to be something that was so damaging to the economy that both parties would want to avoid it. The fact that Republicans embraced the sequester as what they consider a win during the course of this year, despite all the damage that they said they wanted to avoid, for example, to our military, is different from me agreeing to the sequester. All right? So thats point number one. Point number two, every economist will tell you that if we are being smart about growth and were thinking about jobs and were thinking about the middle class, but were also thinking about fiscal responsibility, then what we should be doing is making sure that the drop-off in government spending on vital things like education and infrastructure dont go down too fast, and that rather we look at what the real problem is, which is long-term health care costs. Because of the Affordable Care Act and a lot of changes that are taking place out there among providers, were starting to see health care costs slow. Thats a positive. If we can build on that, then we can capture the same amount of savings that were capturing through the sequester and use those to make sure that were not cutting vital investments that I talked about today, and we can help middle-class families. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Now, I think there are probably going to be 15 different ways for you guys to ask me the same question, which is, But theres Congress. (Laughter.) More specifically, Theres the House Republicans, and what are you going to do about that? NYT: Who are still embracing sequestration and who are still willing to use the debt limit to go to the mat. MR. OBAMA: Well, this is what they say. On the other hand, we also have a number of very thoughtful and sensible Republicans over in the Senate who have said that we should not play brinksmanship, that we should come up with a long-term plan. I met with a couple of House Republicans over the last several weeks who would like to see that happen. Theyre not the loudest voices in the room at the moment. And part of what Id like to see over the next several weeks is, if were having a conversation thats framed as how are we growing the economy, how are we strengthening the middle class, how are we putting people back to work, how are we making college more affordable, how are we bringing manufacturing back -- the answer to those questions I think force a different result than if we are constantly asking ourselves how can we cut the deficit more, faster, sooner. NYT: Have you yielded anything from your outreach to Republicans? And do you still have hope for a 10-year deal by the end of the year? MR. OBAMA: I think its still possible. There are certainly Republicans who are deeply concerned about the effects of sequester. Its been interesting -- Ive talked to a number of them who are from deeply red states, consider themselves very conservative, who say it doesnt make sense for us to cut discretionary spending more; it doesnt make sense for us to cut education further -- because theyre seeing the impacts in their districts. Certainly there are a bunch of Republicans who say for us to hollow out our military as steeply, drastically as were doing if sequester stays in place for next year makes no sense. So if the American people have confidence that theres a path that will grow the economy faster, put more people back to work, that doesnt involve massive new federal spending programs, but instead just make sure that were investing in the right things, and if were being attentive to debt and deficits over a 20, 30-year time horizon, then potentially some of those Republicans start giving voice to their concerns a little more loudly than theyre doing right now. But one of the challenges, as I said in the speech, is that theres almost a kneejerk habit right now that if Im for it, then theyve got to be against it. And I think there are a lot of Republicans who are frustrated by that, because they want to be for something, not just against something. But theyve got to work through that pattern thats developed over the last couple of years. Advertisement Continue reading the main story NYT: A couple of slightly different topics. On the economy, the Fed is obviously an important player. Youve got a big decision ahead of yourself in terms of the chairman. What are you looking for in a chairman? And there were reports yesterday that you are very close to naming Larry Summers as the new Fed chairman. True? MR. OBAMA: I have not made a final decision. Ive narrowed it down to some extraordinarily qualified candidates. NYT: Do you want to say who? MR. OBAMA: No. (Laughter.) NYT: I tried. MR. OBAMA: And what Im looking for is somebody who understands the Fed has a dual mandate, that thats not just lip service; that it is very important to keep inflation in check, to keep our dollar sound, and to ensure stability in the markets. But the idea is not just to promote those things in the abstract. The idea is to promote those things in service of the lives of ordinary Americans getting better. And when unemployment is still too high, and long-term unemployment is still too high, and theres still weak demand in a lot of industries, I want a Fed chairman that can step back and look at that objectively and say, lets make sure that were growing the economy, but lets also keep an eye on inflation, and if it starts heating up, if the markets start frothing up, lets make sure that were not creating new bubbles.

View all New York Times newsletters. NYT: And do you have a timeline in mind for announcing that? MR. OBAMA: I think you can anticipate that over the next several months, an announcement will be made. Ben Bernanke, by the way, has done a fine job as Fed chairman. And when you look at Ben Bernankes testimony, not just last week but over the last couple of years, what hes consistently said is right now, our priority needs to be growing the economy faster and strengthening incomes for ordinary Americans. If we do that, our deficits come down because were bringing in more revenue. If we do that, it becomes easier for us to handle the long-term fiscal challenges. And one of the interesting things that we dont talk about enough is the contrast between whats happened in the United States and whats happened in a lot of other developing countries, Europe in particular. It's pretty rare where we have the chance to look at two policy approaches and follow them over several years and see which one worked. And the fact is there are a lot of European countries who followed the prescription that the House Republicans are calling for right now, and not only have they lagged well below where we've gone in terms of growth, in many cases their debt and their deficits have actually gone up because their economy is still effectively in recession. And although we havent been growing as fast as we would like, we have consistently outperformed those countries that followed the recipe that the House Republicans are offering right now. Now, Im more sympathetic to those European countries because they, in some cases, didnt have a choice. They dont have the dominant world currency. They dont have people who want to invest in their countries the way folks around the world still want to invest in ours. But in some ways, we've got evidence here. This is not an abstract argument. We know what's needed to make our economy grow right now. And if we grow our economy, and middle-class families are doing better, and housing prices are stronger, and young people are starting families of their own and theyre jobs at good wages, thats the thing that will bring deficits down the fastest. NYT: A couple other quick subjects that are economic-related. Keystone pipeline -- Republicans especially talk about that as a big job creator. You've said that you would approve it only if you could be assured it would not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon in the atmosphere. Is there anything that Canada could do or the oil companies could do to offset that as a way of helping you to reach that decision? Advertisement Continue reading the main story MR. OBAMA: Well, first of all, Michael, Republicans have said that this would be a big jobs generator. There is no evidence that thats true. And my hope would be that any reporter who is looking at the facts would take the time to confirm that the most realistic estimates are this might create maybe 2,000 jobs during the construction of the pipeline -- which might take a year or two -- and then after that were talking about somewhere between 50 and 100 [chuckles] jobs in a economy of 150 million working people. NYT: Yet there are a number of unions who want you to approve this. MR. OBAMA: Well, look, they might like to see 2,000 jobs initially. But that is a blip relative to the need. So what we also know is, is that that oil is going to be piped down to the Gulf to be sold on the world oil markets, so it does not bring down gas prices here in the United States. In fact, it might actually cause some gas prices in the Midwest to go up where currently they cant ship some of that oil to world markets. Now, having said that, there is a potential benefit for us integrating further with a reliable ally to the north our energy supplies. But I meant what I said; I'm going to evaluate this based on whether or not this is going to significantly contribute to carbon in our atmosphere. And there is no doubt that Canada at the source in those tar sands could potentially be doing more to mitigate carbon release. NYT: And if they did, could that offset the concerns about the pipeline itself? MR. OBAMA: We haven't seen specific ideas or plans. But all of that will go into the mix in terms of John Kerrys decision or recommendation on this issue. NYT: And then -- Ill let Jackie go -- but on the employer mandate, I dont think youve been asked the question directly why you made the decision to delay it, and whether, given your criticism of President Bush over the years for potentially exceeding his executive authority, theres been a lot of folks out there on the Republican side who claim that somehow youve exceeded your authority on this. Is there anything to that? MR. OBAMA: Well, this was a very practical decision that actually doesnt go to the heart of us implementing the Affordable Care Act. The majority of employers in this country provide health insurance to their employees. And the number of employers who are potentially subject to the employer mandate is relatively small. The way the law was originally written, it did not take into account the fact that we dont necessarily need to load up the vast majority of companies that are already doing the right thing with a bunch of additional paperwork; are there simpler ways for us to allow them to certify that theyre providing health insurance? And if they do that, then the purpose, the spirit of the law is met, and we can concentrate on the few bad actors who are unwilling to provide health insurance to their employees even though they can afford it, and theyre relatively large employers. Advertisement Continue reading the main story And businesses came to us and said, listen, we were supportive of providing health insurance to employees, in fact, we provide health insurance to our employees; we understand you want to get at the bad actors here, but are there ways to provide us some administrative relief? And what we said was, given that that is not critical to standing up the marketplaces where people are going to actually be able to buy lower-cost, high-quality insurance and get the tax credits that make it affordable for them, we thought it made sense to give another year not only for companies to prepare, but also for us to work with Treasury and others to see if there are just ways we can make this a little bit simpler for companies who are already doing the right thing. This is the kind of routine modifications or tweaks to a large program thats starting off that in normal times in a normal political atmosphere would draw a yawn from everybody. The fact that something like this generates a frenzy on Republicans is consistent with the fact that they've voted to repeal this thing 38 times without offering a alternative that is plausible. And from what I understand, based on recent reporting, theyve just given up on offering an alternative. So essentially -- their central economic plan that theyre currently presenting involves making sure that 50 million Americans cannot get health insurance; that people with preexisting conditions are potentially locked out of the market; that the rebates that people have received from insurance companies are sent back; that young people who are right now on their parents plan because theyre 26 or under, that they suddenly dont have health insurance. I do not understand the argument that that somehow grows the economy or strengthens the middle class. And during the course of implementation, are there going to be some glitches? Are there going to be some complaints from employers who are still trying to figure it out and may not know what subsidies are available to them? Absolutely. Are there some folks who may say, we're going to try to figure out ways not to provide health insurance to our employees? Yes. But thats a small proportion of our overall economy, and the principle that everybody should be able to get health insurance is one that the vast majority of Americans agree with. NYT: People questioned your legal and constitutional authority to do that unilaterally -- to delay the employer mandate. Did you consult with your lawyer? MR. OBAMA: Jackie, if you heard me on stage today, what I said was that I will seize any opportunity I can find to work with Congress to strengthen the middle class, improve their prospects, improve their security -- NYT: No, but specifically  MR. OBAMA: -- but where Congress is unwilling to act, I will take whatever administrative steps that I can in order to do right by the American people. And if Congress thinks that what Ive done is inappropriate or wrong in some fashion, theyre free to make that case. But theres not an action that I take that you don't have some folks in Congress who say that I'm usurping my authority. Some of those folks think I usurp my authority by having the gall to win the presidency. And I don't think that's a secret. But ultimately, Im not concerned about their opinions -- very few of them, by the way, are lawyers, much less constitutional lawyers. Advertisement Continue reading the main story I am concerned about the folks who I spoke to today who are working really hard, are trying to figure out how they can send their kids to college, are trying to make sure that they can save for their retirement. And if I can take steps on their behalf, then Im going to do so. And I would hope that more and more of Congress will say, you know what, since thats our primary focus, were willing to work with you to advance those ideals. But Im not just going to sit back if the only message from some of these folks is no on everything, and sit around and twiddle my thumbs for the next 1,200 days. NYT: Polls this week have shown your health care law has lost support. What are you going to be doing to build support? MR. OBAMA: Were going to implement it. NYT: Are you going to be getting out on the road? MR. OBAMA: Here is what will build support, given that weve been outspent four to one from the other side with all kinds of distortions about health care. Here is what were going to do to beat back that misinformation. On October 1st, people are going to be able to start signing up. And if right now theyre buying insurance on the individual market, theyre going to get on those computers or theyre going to make a phone call to one of these call centers and theyre going to find out that they can save 20 percent, 30 percent, or 50 percent on their premiums. And people who have not been able to get insurance before are going to be able to finally get insurance. And people who lose their jobs in the interim and find out that theyve got a preexisting condition, its hard for them to get insurance or they cant afford COBRA, theyre going to have a place to go. And over the course of six months to a year, as people sign up, and it works, and lo and behold, the people who already have health insurance are not being impacted at all other than the fact that their insurance is more secure and they are getting free preventive care, and all the nightmare scenarios and the train wrecks and the sky is falling predictions that come from the other side do not happen, then health care will become more popular. But until then, when were getting outspent four to one and people are just uncertain about what all this means for them, were going to continue to have some polls like that. And me just making more speeches explaining it in and of itself wont do it. The test of this is going to be is it working. And if it works, it will be pretty darn popular. NYT: March on Washington coming up soon. Are you going to do anything to mark it? Are you planning on being a part of the 50th anniversary? MR. OBAMA: Absolutely. Its obviously a historic, seminal event in the country. Its part of my generations formative memory and its a good time for us to do some reflection. Obviously, after the Trayvon Martin case, a lot of people have been thinking about race, but I always remind people -- and, in fact, I have a copy of the original program in my office, framed -- that that was a march for jobs and justice; that there was a massive economic component to that. When you think about the coalition that brought about civil rights, it wasnt just folks who believed in racial equality; it was people who believed in working folks having a fair shot. It was Walter Reuther and the UAW coming down here because they understood that if there are some workers who are not getting a fair deal then ultimately thats going to undercut their ability to get a fair deal. And if theres one thing that I wanted to try to emphasize today in this speech, it is that America has always worked better when everybody has a chance to succeed. Advertisement Continue reading the main story I had a conversation a couple of weeks back with a guy named Robert Putnam, who Ive known for a long time. NYT: He was my professor actually at Harvard. MR. OBAMA: Right. I actually knew Bob when I was a state senator and he had put together this seminar to just talk about some of the themes that he had written about in Bowling Alone, the weakening of the community fabric and the impact its having on people. And the work hes doing right now has to do with this issue of inequality. And it applies to a city like Galesburg, where 30 years ago, anybody in this town who wanted to find a job, they could go get a job. They could go get it at the Maytag plant. They could go get it with the railroad. It might be hard work, it might be tough work, but they could buy a house with it. The kids here all went to the same school -- the bankers kid and the guy working at the Maytag plants going to the same school. They've got the same social support. College is affordable for all of them. They don't have to take out $100,000 of debt to do it. And there was a sense of not upward mobility in the abstract; it was part and parcel of who we were as Americans. And thats whats been eroding over the last 20, 30 years, well before the financial crisis. Now, the financial crisis made things a lot worse. And so I had to spend the first four years in my presidency getting us back to ground level. We had to make sure the banking system wasn't collapsing. We had to make sure the auto industry didn't collapse. We had to make sure that we put people back to work short term and boosted demand until the markets got going and consumers got more confident and housing started to recover. And so here we are, having dealt with this massive crisis, but those trends -- that erosion of what a Galesburg or a [Port]* Clinton, Ohio, where Bob Putnam lived -- those trends have continued. And thats what people sense. That's why people are anxious. That's why people are frustrated. That's what they talk to me about and that's what they write to me about: I'm doing okay right now, but what I've seen over the last 20 years and what I learned profoundly during this crisis is that the ground under my feet just isn't as secure, and that the work I'm doing may not be rewarded. And everything that I am proposing and everything I will be proposing over the next three years goes right at that issue. And if thats not what Washingtons talking about, then we will be missing the boat. And racial tensions wont get better; they may get worse, because people will feel as if theyve got to compete with some other group to get scraps from a shrinking pot. If the economy is growing, everybody feels invested. Everybody feels as if we're rolling in the same direction. And so a lot of the other issues that were talking about -- whether its climate change or immigration, or how we manage our trade relations -- all those are eased if weve got our economic act together. But thats not what we talk about. And it's true that Congress moves at such a glacial pace these days that sometimes if you start a bill like immigration and you're thinking this should be done by now, it seems to take a year of folks just sitting around spinning their wheels, that can be frustrating. But we should be able to attend to some of these other issues even as were staying focused on this central issue. Thats at least what Im going to be doing.

21570,Remarks by the President on Increasing Oversight on Manipulation in Oil Markets,"Rose Garden 11:27 A.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT: Good morning, everybody. Lately, Ive been speaking a lot about our need for an all-of-the-above strategy for American energy -- a strategy that produces more oil and gas here at home, but also produces more biofuels and fuel-efficient cars, more solar power and wind power and other sources of clean, renewable energy. This strategy is not just the right thing to do for our long-term economic growth; its also the right way for us to reduce our dependence on foreign oil right now. Its the right way for us to put people to work right now. And ultimately, its the right way to stop spikes in gas prices that weve put up [with] every single year -- the same kind of increase that weve seen over the past couple of months. Obviously rising gas prices means a rough ride for a lot of families. Whether youre trying to get to school, trying to get to work, do some grocery shopping, you have to be able to fill up that gas tank. And there are families in certain parts of the country that have no choice but to drive 50 or 60 miles to get to the job. So when gas prices go up, its like an additional tax that comes right out of your pocket. Thats one of the reasons we passed a payroll tax cut at the beginning of this year and made sure it extended all the way through this year, so that the average American is getting that extra $40 in every paycheck right now. But I think everybody understands that there are no quick fixes to this problem. There are politicians who say that if we just drilled more then gas prices would come down right away. What they dont say is that we have been drilling more. Under my administration, America is producing more oil than at any time in the last eight years. Weve opened up new areas for exploration. We've quadrupled the number of operating rigs to a record high. We've added enough new oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth and then some. But as I've said repeatedly, the problem is we use more than 20 percent of the worlds oil and we only have 2 percent of the worlds proven oil reserves. Even if we drilled every square inch of this country right now, wed still have to rely disproportionately on other countries for their oil. That means we pay more at the pump every time theres instability in the Middle East, or growing demand in countries like China and India. Thats whats happening right now. Its those global trends that are affecting gas prices. So even as we're tackling issues of supply and demand, even as we're looking at the long-term in terms of how we can structurally make ourselves less reliant on foreign oil, we still need to work extra hard to protect consumers from factors that should not affect the price of a barrel of oil. That includes doing everything we can to ensure that an irresponsible few arent able to hurt consumers by illegally manipulating or rigging the energy markets for their own gain. We can't afford a situation where speculators artificially manipulate markets by buying up oil, creating the perception of a shortage, and driving prices higher -- only to flip the oil for a quick profit. We cant afford a situation where some speculators can reap millions, while millions of American families get the short end of the stick. Thats not the way the market should work. And for anyone who thinks this cannot happen, just think back to how Enron traders manipulated the price of electricity to reap huge profits at everybody elses expense. Now, the good news is my administration has already taken several actions to step up oversight of oil markets and close dangerous loopholes that were allowing some traders to operate in the shadows. We closed the so-called Enron loophole that let traders evade oversight by using electronic or overseas trading platforms. In the Wall Street reform law, we said for the first time that federal regulators will make sure no single trader can buy such a large position in oil that they could easily manipulate the market on their own. So Id point out that anybody whos pledging to roll back Wall Street reform -- Dodd-Frank -- would also roll back this vital consumer protection along with it. Ive asked Attorney General Holder to work with Chairman Leibowitz of the Federal Trade Commission, Chairman Gensler of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and other enforcement agencies to make sure that acts of manipulation, fraud or other illegal activity are not behind increases in the price that consumers pay at the pump. So today, were announcing new steps to strengthen oversight of energy markets. Things that we can do administratively, we are doing. And I call on Congress to pass a package of measures to crack down on illegal activity and hold accountable those who manipulate the market for private gain at the expense of millions of working families. And be specific. First, Congress should provide immediate funding to put more cops on the beat to monitor activity in energy markets. This funding would also upgrade technology so that our surveillance and enforcement officers arent hamstrung by older and less sophisticated tools than the ones that traders are using. We should strengthen protections for American consumers, not gut them. And these markets have expanded significantly. Chairman Gensler actually had a good analogy. He said, imagine if the NFL quadrupled the number of teams but didnt increase the number of refs. Youd end up having havoc on the field, and it would diminish the game. It wouldnt be fair. Thats part of whats going on in a lot of these markets. So we have to properly resource enforcement. Second, Congress should increase the civil and criminal penalties for illegal energy market manipulation and other illegal activities. So my plan would toughen key financial penalties tenfold, and impose these penalties not just per violation, but for every day a violation occurs. Third, Congress should give the agency responsible for overseeing oil markets new authority to protect against volatility and excess speculation by making sure that traders can post appropriate margins, which simply means that they actually have the money to make good on their trades. Congress should do all of this right away. A few weeks ago, Congress had a chance to stand up for families already paying an extra premium at the pump; congressional Republicans voted to keep spending billions of Americans' hard-earned tax dollars on more unnecessary subsidies for big oil companies. So here's a chance to make amends, a chance to actually do something that will protect consumers by increasing oversight of energy markets. That should be something that everybody, no matter their party, should agree with. And I hope Americans will ask their members of Congress to step up. In the meantime, my administration will take new executive actions to better analyze and investigate trading activities in energy markets and more quickly implement the tough consumer protections under Wall Street reform. Let me close by saying none of these steps by themselves will bring gas prices down overnight. But it will prevent market manipulation and make sure we're looking out for American consumers. And in the meantime we're going to keep pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy for American energy to break the cycle of price spikes year after year. We are going to keep producing more biofuels; we're going to keep producing more fuel-efficient cars; we are going to keep tapping into every source of American-made energy. And these steps have already helped put America on a path to greater energy independence. Our foreign -- our dependence on foreign oil has actually decreased each year I've been in office -- even as the economy has grown. America now imports less than half of the oil we use for the first time in more than a decade. So we are less vulnerable than we were, but we're still too vulnerable. We've got to continue the hard, sustained work on this issue. And as long as I'm President we're going to keep placing our bets on America's future -- America's workers, America's technology, America's ingenuity, and American-made energy. That's how we're going to solve this problem once and for all. Thank you very much, everybody. END 11:35 A.M.

21920,The Gingrich Tragedy,"Though his ideas stray, his most common theme is that government should intervene in crucial ways to create a dynamic, decentralized, low- tax society. So why am I not more excited by the Gingrich surge? In the first place, Gingrich loves government more than I do. He has no Hayekian modesty to restrain his faith in statist endeavor. For example, he has called for a massive new program to build a permanent lunar colony to exploit the Moons resources. He has suggested that a mirror system in space could provide the light equivalent of many full moons so that there would be no need for nighttime lighting of the highways. Photo Im for national greatness conservatism, but this is a little too great. Furthermore, he has an unconservative faith in his own innocence. The crossroads where government meets enterprise can be an exciting crossroads. It can also be a corrupt crossroads. It requires moral rectitude to separate public service from private gain. Gingrich was perfectly content to belly up to the Freddie Mac trough and then invent a Hamiltonian rationale to justify his own greed. Then there is his rhetorical style. He seems to have understood that a moderate Republican like himself can win so long as he adopts a bombastic style when taking on the liberal elites. Most people just want somebody who can articulate their hatreds, and Gingrich is demagogically happy to play the role.

View all New York Times newsletters. Most important, there is temperament and character. As Yuval Levin noted in a post for National Review, the two Republican front-runners, Gingrich and Mitt Romney are both very wonky Rockefeller Republicans who moved to the right over time as their party moved right. But they have very different temperaments. Romney, Levin observes, has an executive temperament  organization, discipline, calm and restraint. Gingrich has a revolutionary temperament  intensity, energy, disorganization and a tendency to see everything as a cataclysmic clash requiring a radical response. Id make a slightly similar point more rudely. In the two main Republican contenders, we have one man, Romney, who seems to have walked straight out of the 1950s, and another, Gingrich, who seems to have walked straight out of the 1960s. He has every negative character trait that conservatives associate with 60s excess: narcissism, self-righteousness, self-indulgence and intemperance. He just has those traits in Republican form. As nearly everyone who has ever worked with him knows, he would severely damage conservatism and the Republican Party if nominated. He would severely damage the Hamilton- Theodore Roosevelt strain in American life. Its really too bad. We could have had a great debate about the progressive-conservative tradition. President Obama is now embracing Roosevelt. Gingrich has tried to modernize this tendency.

22191,"Tim Pawlenty press-palooza. Prez candidate barnstorms FL, explains record","From gay marriage to global warming to immigration and taxes, Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty doesn't flinch from a chance to sit down and answer questions about his record and his candidacy (unlike many candidates). Pawlenty sat down yesterday afternoon with the St. Petersburg Times on camera and then after a day of fundraising, did the same with the Miami Herald. Here's a partial transcript: Q: Youre racking up endorsements from top Florida legislators, but stuck at the bottom of the polls. Why? Pawlenty: The early days of campaigning in a state like Florida are retail..Early polls dont predict anything, ultimately. If they did, Hillary Clinton or Rudy Giuliani would be president today. National polls basically always misinterpret the final outcome or mis-predict the final outcome. Q: Explain Floridas role in your campaign and the election? Pawlenty: Florida plays a pivotal role not just in the general election, but more often than not in the primary. This can be kind of the state where the putative nominee is selected. So we take that very seriously. Q: What do you think of the debt ceiling? Pawlenty: The debt ceiling agreement was really disappointing. This is an agreement that doesnt really fix the problem.But they didnt really fix the underlying structural problem of the country. Q: Are you letting the perfect become the enemy of the good? Why not accept something mediocre? Pawlenty: I dont think underwhelming or disappointing or mediocre or below average or flat-out pathetic is good enough for America anymore. We are in deep trouble. And the standard shouldnt be: What are those things that we can do that are mediocre, disappointing, underwhelming, uninspiring or lacking in courage? The standard should be: What can we do to continue this country to be the greatest country on the face of the earth. We should have a president whos leading the debate on these issues? And instead hes hiding, hes ducking, hes bobbing, hes weaving. You cant even find him on the major financial issues of our day. How he would reform Social Security. How he would reform Medicare. How he would reform Medicaid and so on. ""Most of the things that theyve now promised are in the future. Theyre contingent upon future action. And guess what? A future president and a future Congress could undo or duck all of those as well."" Q: What would you do with Social Security? Pawlenty: If youre on the program now or anywhere near eligibility, you shouldnt have your benefits impacted. But if youre in the next generation, were telling you now with several decades of warning, were going to gradually raise the retirement age over time. If youre lower income or middle income, you should still get your cost-of-living adjustment. But in the future, if youre real wealthy, were going to have to slow that down or take it away. Thats the way it is. This thing is drowning. And what people dont realize, if we dont make these kinds of changes, in current law, Social Security gets automatic cuts for everybody. So anybody whos in favor of doing nothing is in favor of cutting Social Security. And there are similar answers for Medicaid and Medicare. Q: Some of the increased spending happened in the Bush years, when two wars, a new Medicare prescription drug entitlement program and tax cuts were approved. Why not scale back all of that, including the tax cuts? Pawlenty: You have to look back at what got is into the mess. And, again, revenues kept up with the private economy. Its the government spending that went way beyond that While its fair to say that parties in Congress and both parties in the White House contributed to this problem, its also absolutely true that President Obama has made it exponentially worse. When President Bush left office, the deficit was approximately $500 billion. It is now approximately now $1.5 trillion. In other words, president Obama has essentially tripled the deficit. To make matters worse, he promised in the first few months of his presidency, that he would cut the deficit in half during his first term, which has turned out to be a broken promise. Q: Part of the Obama deficit was the stimulus, but a number of Republican governors such as yourself both bashed it and took the money at the same time. How do you explain that? Pawlenty: Theres a lot of reasons for it. If the federal government is dumb enough to give it to us, well be smart enough to take it. In Minnesotas case, we are not a net taker of money from the federal government. According to the Tax Foundation, for every dollar Minnesota sends to the federal government, we get approximately 73 cents back. We more than pay for our share of federal spending. Q: The Club for Growth gave you credit for stopping more than $7 billion in proposed tax increases and for holding down spending from a liberal legislature, but it expressed concern about what it called your nanny-state solution to cut down on smoking and fund public healthcare by hiking taxes on cigarettes. Can you explain?",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/14/tim-pawlenty/do-scientists-disagree-about-global-warming/,Science,Polifact
22354,"Commerce nominee appears to endorse world government in video, Republicans say","Does John Bryson, Barack Obamas nominee for commerce secretary, want a world government? Critics say a newly uncovered video of the nominee suggests that he does. In the video  given to The Daily Caller by sources on Capitol Hill  Bryson refers to the 2009 United Nations climate negotiations in Copenhagen as the closest thing we have to a world governance organization, implying it provided the best model for imposing climate regulations on countries around the globe. Bryson also boasts about his role as an adviser to the U.N. secretary general on climate change in the video. Brysons nomination has already run into problems stemming from his involvement in the founding of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a liberal environmental group, during the 1970s. Critics say Brysons advocacy of cap and trade, among other environmental regulations, is at odds with the pro-business mission of the Commerce Department. This video adds to the controversy. Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe, the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Commerce Committee, has denounced Bryson for favoring what the senator calls the administrations job-killing agenda. California Rep. Darrell Issa, who chairs the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, has attacked Bryson for being a green evangelist. The nominees remarks seem to imply he longs for a more powerful U.N. that can impose its will in addressing climate change, according to Colin Hanna, president of Let Freedom Ring. Brysons willingness to cede American sovereignty over domestic energy production to the United Nations may be a disqualifier for him to serve as secretary of commerce, said Brian Darling, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation who watched the video. Bryson should be asked to explain his comments and where the United Nations derives the authority to force the United States into U.N.-approved regulations on U.S. energy producers. Constitutional conservatives do not believe that the United Nations has the authority under the US Constitution to mandate any changes to U.S. policy and if Bryson was advocating for this, then Senators should take that important factor into consideration during the confirmation process of Bryson. Other conservative critics note that the secretary of commerces role is to promote trade around the globe and say Brysons comments seem to place his commitment to that role in doubt. The point is that his views on global government and on global governance, and on climate change are diametrically opposed to goals of the commerce secretary, said Hanna. His job is to increase exports, reduce unemployment, provide jobs and help the US economy. But Brysons advocacy of global carbon emissions standards would accomplish the exact opposite, according to Hanna. If we followed the standards of Copenhagen, we would have decreased exports, increased unemployment and a loss of global competitiveness, Hanna said. He is wrong on just about every metric by which a commerce secretary is judged. However, Myron Ebell, director of energy and climate change at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, told TheDC the video was not much of a smoking gun. While Ebell believes conservatives and libertarians have a lot to be concerned about regarding Brysons nomination, latching onto his comments in the video are a bit of stretch. Bryson has received the backing of the New York Times editorial page, which lauded his distinguished career as a businessman, public servant and environmentalist and called him the right businessman-environmentalist for the job in a June 5 column. The nominees background as CEO of Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison, does not imply that he has an understanding of competitive business because utilities are quasi-governmental monopolies that would benefit from higher electricity prices stemming from cap and trade, according to Ebell.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/09/gop-critics/anonymous-gop-officials-claim-commerce-nominee-joh/,Science,Polifact
22580,Shifts to and from Daylight Saving Time and Incidence of Myocardial Infarction,"To the Editor: More than 1.5 billion men and women are exposed to the transitions involved in daylight saving time: turning clocks forward by an hour in the spring and backward by an hour in the autumn. These transitions can disrupt chronobiologic rhythms and influence the duration and quality of sleep, and the effect lasts for several days after the shifts.1,2 We examined the influence of these transitions on the incidence of acute myocardial infarction. To calculate the incidence ratio, we compared the incidence of acute myocardial infarction during each of the first 7 days after the spring or autumn transition and the mean of the incidences on the corresponding weekdays 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after the day of interest. For example, for the Tuesday after the transition, we would have divided the incidence on that Tuesday by the mean of the incidence on the Tuesday 2 weeks earlier and the incidence on the Tuesday 2 weeks later. We used data from the Swedish registry of acute myocardial infarction, which provides high-quality information on all acute myocardial infarctions in the country since 1987. The incidence ratios, as measures of relative risk, and exact 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Figure 1. Figure 1. Incidence Ratios of Acute Myocardial Infarction on the First 7 Days after the Spring and Autumn Clock Shifts for Daylight Saving Time. The incidence is represented by the ratio of the number of acute myocardial infarctions (as the main diagnosis) on the given day after the shift to the mean number on the corresponding days 2 weeks earlier and 2 weeks later (both numbers given above the bars). Analyses of the data for the spring shift are based on the 15 years between 1987 and 2006 in which Easter Sunday was not the transition day (Panel A). Analyses of the data for the autumn shift are based on all 20 years between 1987 and 2006 (Panel B). In the autumn (Panel B), the control period was defined as the corresponding weekdays 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after the day of interest. In spring (Panel A), we aimed to avoid interference with Easter, the only public holiday that could influence our results. For years in which Easter Sunday was celebrated 2 weeks after the Sunday of the spring shift, we defined the control period for the Sunday of the shift as the Sunday 3 weeks before and the Sunday 3 weeks after (thus skipping Easter Sunday). When we did not exclude Easter if it coincided with the exposure or control days, we observed an even higher effect size associated with the spring transition. The number of acute myocardial infarctions on the transition Sunday was adjusted for the difference in day length as compared with the control Sundays (i.e., 23 vs. 24 hours in the spring [Panel A] and 25 vs. 24 hours in the autumn [Panel B]). The results of secondary analyses for both spring and autumn, which included acute myocardial infarctions that were either the main or secondary diagnoses, were essentially similar to the results of the analyses that included main diagnoses alone, as were the results of analyses of the spring shift that were restricted to fatal cases. For the autumn shift, in contrast to the analyses of all acute myocardial infarctions, analyses restricted to fatal cases showed a smaller decrease in the incidence of acute myocardial infarction on Monday, and the risk of fatal acute myocardial infarction increased during the first week after the shift. I bars denote 95% confidence intervals. The incidence of acute myocardial infarction was significantly increased for the first 3 weekdays after the transition to daylight saving time in the spring (Figure 1A). The incidence ratio for the first week after the spring shift, calculated as the incidence for all 7 days divided by the mean of the weekly incidences 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after, was 1.051 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.032 to 1.071). In contrast, after the transition out of daylight saving time in the autumn, only the first weekday was affected significantly (Figure 1B); the incidence ratio for the whole week was 0.985 (95% CI, 0.969 to 1.002). The effect of the spring transition to daylight saving time on the incidence of acute myocardial infarction was somewhat more pronounced in women than in men, and the autumn effect was more pronounced in men than in women. The separate analyses of the 19871996 and 19972006 periods yielded essentially the same results as those for the whole 19872006 period. The effects of transitions were consistently more pronounced for people under 65 years of age than for those 65 years of age or older. The most plausible explanation for our findings is the adverse effect of sleep deprivation on cardiovascular health. According to experimental studies, this adverse effect includes the predominance of sympathetic activity and an increase in proinflammatory cytokine levels.3,4 Our data suggest that vulnerable people might benefit from avoiding sudden changes in their biologic rhythms. It has been postulated that people in Western societies are chronically sleep deprived, since the average sleep duration decreased from 9.0 to 7.5 hours during the 20th century.4 Therefore, it is important to examine whether we can achieve beneficial effects with prolonged sleep. The finding that the possibility of additional sleep seems to be protective on the first workday after the autumn shift is intriguing. Monday is the day of the week associated with the highest risk of acute myocardial infarction, with the mental stress of starting a new workweek and the increase in activity suggested as an explanation.5 Our results raise the possibility that there is another, sleep-related component in the excess incidence of acute myocardial infarction on Monday. Sleep-diary studies suggest that bedtimes and wake-up times are usually later on weekend days than on weekdays; the earlier wake-up times on the first workday of the week and the consequent minor sleep deprivation can be hypothesized to have an adverse cardiovascular effect in some people. This effect would be less pronounced with the transition out of daylight saving time, since it allows for additional sleep. Studies are warranted to examine the possibility that a more stable weekly pattern of waking up in the morning and going to sleep at night or a somewhat later wake-up time on Monday might prevent some acute myocardial infarctions.

22958,"Loughlin on taxes, Boehner, climate change + more","Loughlin on taxes, Boehner, climate change + more As previously noted, John Loughlin wasted little time in planning the launch of his general election campaign against David Cicilline. The Republican made his entrance by carrying his podium to a sunny spot in front of the state Department of Administration. Press interest was strong. (And Loughlin already has another news conference, on small business, set for tomorrow). Heres the short form of the tax issue, the ostensible reason for the newser: Loughlin says he will not vote to raise taxes on any Rhode Islander, and he wants to continue the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts that are due to expire next year. (In response to my question, he says he doesnt call them the Bush tax cuts since Congress had a role in passing them.) (Cicilline campaign manager Eric Hyers says the Democratic CD1 candidate opposes any tax hikes for hard-working middle-class Rhode Islanders, but opposes Bush-era tax breaks for individuals earning more than $250,000.) Some related highlights from Loughlins press event: Jim Baron from the Times of Pawtucket asked Loughlin about his statement that Cicilline would be a rubber stamp for Nancy Pelosi. So, Baron wondered, would the Tiverton Republican be a rubber stamp for John Boehner? I would answer that, Jim, by saying, just take a look at the record; Have I been a rubber stamp for Governor Carcieris agenda? Ive always been an independent thinker  thats the hallmark of my time in the General Assembly, and it certainly will be the hallmark of my time in Washington. Loughlin was a little cute slightly dodging questions about national Republican interest in helping him (Tim White has more on this topic, following up on a question raised here). Loughlin said hed welcome assistance, of course. The NRCC [National Republican Congressional Committee] has not made a contribution to my campaign, to my knowledge, theyve havent made a contribution to anybodys at this point. Steve Klamkin from WPRO asked what kind of campaign the Republican expects and hopes for with Cicilline: You know, Im not going to try to war-game what my opponents campaign will be. I will tell you that my campaign is and continues to be issues-based. Sean Daly of Channel 12 queried on the Scott Brown comparisons: Hes a lot taller than I was, for one thing, and his truck was newer [Loughlin drives a pickup]. I mean, uh, everybody likes to draw comparisons to other races. I think that this race is unique. Keep in mind that I had entered this race before anyone had even heard of Scott Brown. Michelle Smith of the AP asked about Loughlins views on climate change: I think that there is, in fact, climate change. I think the data is unclear as to the extent of man-caused climate change. When you look at the total percentage of greenhouse gas emissions, a good number of them  in fact, the vast majority  are naturally occuring. Certainly, the data that has come out lately has cast some cold water on those who have adopted climate change, man-caused climate change, as a religion, and I think that we need to take a much, much closer look at real actual data to make sure, in fact, were not creating more of a problem by thinking we have more of an influence than we do. I worked for the space program, for example. And in 1976, we put a lander on Mars, and from 1976 to the present day, surface temperatures on the surface of Mars have risen.

23436,"Dont Use Gulf Crisis to Raid Trust Fund, Force BP-Endorsed National Energy Tax","WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following remarks on the Senate floor Wednesday regarding Democrat efforts to use the oil spill liability trust fund to pay for new, unrelated spending: Our nation faces many urgent crises at the moment. Americans are looking for solutions. Theyre not getting any from Washington. Whether its the housing crisis, the financial crisis, the debt crisis, or the crisis in the Gulf, what theyre getting is a White House and a Democrat majority in Congress that seems more intent on pursuing a government-driven political agenda than in finding common-sense solutions to the problems that ail us. Americans are exasperated by all this, but they shouldnt be surprised  because if theres one motto that defines this administration, it the one that was delivered by the White House chief of staff in a revealing moment just after the Presidents election. Im referring, of course, to what Mr. Emanuel famously referred to as Rule One: Never allow a crisis go to waste. Its a fitting slogan for an administration that saw a crisis at some of Americas great auto-making firms as an opportunity for government to extend its reach into industrial policy; which saw the panic on Wall Street as an opportunity for government to extend its reach further into Main Street; which saw out-of-control costs in health care as an opportunity to extend governments reach further into the health care decisions of every American; and which is now talking about using a nightmarish environmental calamity in the Gulf as a prime opportunity to extend governments reach even further into Americans lives through a new job-killing national energy tax that would hit every single household and business, small or large, in America. Think about it: for more than fifty straight days, an underwater geyser of oil now roughly the size of Vermont has been polluting the Gulf. This is the kind of crisis that in the past would have united the nation in a focused effort to solve the problem. And yet day after day, as this toxic oil continues to flow, what we get from the administration is some new twist on the blame game or some ham-handed effort to appear in control of the situation. Meanwhile, here in Congress, were getting much the same thing: the deficit Extenders Bill thats now on the floor was supposed to be about giving job creators some assurance that the tax benefits theyre currently receiving, and which they depend on to retain workers will be there the next time they have to make a major business-related decision. Yet Democrats are using this bill as another opportunity to extend governments reach. Desperate for funds to bail out government programs, theyre raiding a trust fund that was created  get this  to pay for just the kind of cleanup we now need in the Gulf. Theyre quintupling the tax oil companies pay into the oil spill liability trust fund that was created in the wake of Exxon Valdez, and instead of using this money to clean up the oil spewing in the Gulf, theyre raiding the trust fund to pay for new, unrelated spending. In other words, theyre using the crisis in the Gulf not only as cover for even more government spending, but as a major source of funding for it. This is an outrage. And it should give every American a window into the Democrat approach to spending as well as their lack of seriousness about the debt; they just cant restrain themselves. Thats the only possible excuse for raiding this trust fund for unrelated government spending. At the same time, as Americans wonder when this gusher will ever be plugged, we hear word that the administration and the Majority Leader want to piggyback their controversial new national energy tax  also known as cap-and-trade, to an oil spill response bill that could and should be an opportunity for true bipartisan cooperation. So here again, we see the administration using a crisis, in this case the disaster in the Gulf, as an opportunity to muscle through Congress another deeply unpopular bill that has profound implications for small business and struggling households. Look: if the health care debate taught us anything, its that Americans want these kinds of massive bills debated out in the open  not rushed past them on a holiday or tacked onto a must-pass bill aimed at alleviating the kind of suffering were seeing in the Gulf. The problem for Democrats is that debating the Democrat cap-and-trade bill might not fit neatly into the White House messaging plan, since its been widely reported that a major part of the Kerry-Lieberman bill was essentially written by BP. This is clearly an inconvenient fact: an administration that seems to spend most of its time coming up with new ways to show how angry it is with BP is pushing a proposal that BP helped write. I cant understand, and I dont think the American people will understand, why the Majority believes that it make sense to respond to the BP oil spill by imposing a gas tax increase on the American people that was advocated by  BP. I think the American people want us to work together to address the disaster in the Gulf, not exploit it for partisan political purposes. The oil spill trust fund ought to be used to clean up oil spills. This is one crisis that Americans wont let Democrats exploit for their policy purposes ###",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/14/mitch-mcconnell/mcconnell-says-kerry-lieberman-climate-bill-essent/,Science,Polifact
132,The Honey Chrome extension: An example of what's new and better,"To paraphrase the Most Interesting Man in the World, I don't always bring coupons to the store, but when I do I usually forget to apply them when checking out. I've resorted to wrapping the coupon around my credit card so I'll remember it. Online shopping is much the same experience for me. I usually skip over coupon code fields since I don't receive coupons by email and searching the web for them is too much trouble when I need that anniversary gift shipped out NOW. Sign up for TechRepublic's Google in the Enterprise newsletter! Subscribe The benefit of Honey Figure A Because of my chronic lack of coupon awareness, I was interested to read about Honey , a Chrome extension which can do the coupon-hunting for you. Honey adds a ""Find savings"" button () to many prominent sites (Amazon.com, Old Navy, Best Buy, etc.) which you can use at checkout. Any relevant or applicable coupons can then be applied to your order. Their main site has a FAQ with the full rundown. I have to admit a part of me was skeptical. As a system administrator I spent many horrible years dealing with spyware on computer systems at work and home, fixing suffocated PCs for fellow employees, friends, and family alike. Though the spyware heyday seems to be waning fast (thankfully), I still grimace in disgust at the memory of Bargain Buddy, CoolWebSearch, Gator, and similar ilk which caused me to pull out my hair in frustration and reach for the Advil. Years in the trenches conditioned a deep and healthy skepticism in me towards anything I need to install to obtain ""offers,"" ""savings,"" ""deals,"" etc. However, this is a new era. I kept an open mind and was pleased to see that Honey does what it's supposed to without any gimmicks, tricks or ulterior motives. I tested this extension to see how it affected my system (see ""Are you sure it's not spyware?"" below for details) to confirm that it had no adverse impact. Installing Honey At present Honey only runs on Chrome, but extensions for other browsers are in the works. Figure B To install Honey in Chrome, access www.joinhoney.com .

372,Jealousy in Dogs,"It is commonly assumed that jealousy is unique to humans, partially because of the complex cognitions often involved in this emotion. However, from a functional perspective, one might expect that an emotion that evolved to protect social bonds from interlopers might exist in other social species, particularly one as cognitively sophisticated as the dog. The current experiment adapted a paradigm from human infant studies to examine jealousy in domestic dogs. We found that dogs exhibited significantly more jealous behaviors (e.g., snapping, getting between the owner and object, pushing/touching the object/owner) when their owners displayed affectionate behaviors towards what appeared to be another dog as compared to nonsocial objects. These results lend support to the hypothesis that jealousy has some primordial form that exists in human infants and in at least one other social species besides humans. As discussed earlier, the proposed function of jealousy is to break-up a potentially threatening liaison and protect the primary relationship. This motivates several types of behaviors including approach actions such as attempts to get physically or psychologically between the attachment 3ure and the interloper, attending to the threatening interaction, seeking attention from the attachment figure, as well as indicators of negative emotion such as aggression, particularly toward the interloper [1]  [2] , [8] , [10]  [12] , [19] . Across social species, we would expect to see similar types of behaviors that serve the function of this motivational state. Therefore, the specific behaviors assessed in our experiment were based on studies of jealousy in non-verbal human infants and adults as well as behaviors described by dog owners and experts as indicative of jealousy. To evaluate dogs' jealous behaviors, we modified a paradigm used to assess jealousy in 6-month-old infants [10]  [12] . Thirty-six dogs were individually tested and videotaped while their owners ignored them and interacted with a series of three different objects. In the jealousy condition, the owner treated a stuffed dog, which briefly barked and wagged its tail, as if it were a real dog (e.g., petting, talking sweetly). In another condition, owners engaged in these same behaviors but did so towards a novel object (jack-o-lantern pail). This enabled us to test whether the elicitation of jealousy required that the owner show affection to an appropriate stimulus (what appeared to be a conspecific) or whether affectionate behaviors directed to a nonsocial stimulus would be enough to arouse jealous behaviors. In the third condition, the owner read aloud a children's book, which had pop-up pages and played melodies. This condition allowed us to test whether dogs' behaviors in the other conditions were indicative of jealousy per se (arising over the loss of affection and attention towards an interloper) or more general negative affect due to the loss of the owner's attention. Although there are several reasons to predict that jealousy should lie within a dog's emotional repertoire, empirical evidence is lacking. The purpose of the present study was to construct a social situation and determine whether dogs, whose owners show affection to a potential interloper, engage in behaviors indicative of jealousy. The idea that dogs are capable of jealousy is congenial to the burgeoning body of research on animal social cognition that reveals that dogs have sophisticated social-cognitive abilities. For example, dogs can use a variety of human communicative signals (e.g., pointing, eye gaze) to determine the location of hidden food [16] , are better at using social cues than chimpanzees [16] , show some sensitivity to reward inequity when a partner is rewarded and they are not [17] and appear aware of, and actively attempt to manipulate, the visual attention of their play partners [18] . The functional account we are proposing would further predict that jealousy should occur not only in humans, but also in other social species in which emotional bonds between individuals develop and can be threatened by third parties. Interestingly, several observers of animal behavior, including Charles Darwin [13] , have suggested that jealousy may exist in other species, particularly in dogs. This possibility has also been underscored in a recent paper that had owners recount specific cases of their animals displaying emotions [14] . Descriptions of dog jealousy were fairly consistent across owners and always involved a social triangle. When the owners gave attention and affection to another person or animal, the dogs seemed to engage in attention-seeking behaviors (pushing against the owner or in between the owner and the rival, barking/growling/whining) and some showed aggression. Reports of the occurrence of jealousy in dogs was at least as common, if not more so, than some other emotions that are often considered more primary (anxiety and anger). However, despite such reports, experimental evidence demonstrating behavioral indices of jealousy in dogs does not exist. This type of empirical research seems particularly important, given that dog owners also report that their animals experience guilt but experimental work raises some doubt about whether dogs do show guilt [15] . The theory that jealousy can take a primordial form finds support from the small but emerging body of research on human infant jealousy. Several studies [10]  [12] found that infants as young as 6-months of age show behaviors indicative of jealousy, for example, when their mothers interacted with what appeared to be another infant (but was actually a realistic looking doll). The infants did not display the same behaviors when their mothers attend to a nonsocial item (a book). One possibility is that jealousy first evolved in the context of sibling-parent relationships where dependent offspring compete for parental resources. An implication of this hypothesis is that jealousy may have a primordial or core form that can be triggered without complex cognition about the self or about the meaning of the social interaction [1] , [9] . This primordial form of jealousy may be elicited by the relatively simple perception that an attachment figure or loved one's attention has been captured by a potential usurper, which suffices to elicit a motive to regain the loved one's attention and block the liaison. Primordial jealousy may serve as the building block for jealousy elicited by more complex cognitive processes. For example, in adult human relationships, the experience of jealousy is greatly impacted by additional appraisals about the meaning of the interaction (e.g., does this mean my mate will leave me? Am I unloveable?). In both primordial and complex cases of jealousy, there is a motivation to restore the relationship and remove the usurper. However, in the latter case, interpretations of the situation play a large role in the elicitation and experience of the emotion. The vast majority of research in this area has concentrated on jealousy within romantic relationships particularly over potential or actual infidelity. Hence, functional or evolutionary analysis of jealousy has focused on the fitness consequences of loss of a romantic or sexual relationship (e.g., cuckoldry, loss of resources) and on the psychological and behavioral effects of protecting such relationships [5]  [7] . A broader functional view, however, would argue that jealousy evolved to secure resources not just in the context of sexual relationships, but also in any of a wide-range of valued relationships [1] , [8] . Accordingly, the same underlying emotional process that gives rise to jealousy in sexual relationships also produces jealousy in other types of bonds (e.g., friendships). In humans, jealousy is an emotion with far-reaching psychological and social consequences. For example, it typically emerges as the third leading cause of non-accidental homicide across cultures [1] . While the origins and possible function of jealousy have been debated, most theorists agree on one defining feature: It requires a social triangle, arising when an interloper threatens an important relationship. A common assumption has been that the elicitation of jealousy involves, and perhaps requires, complex cognitive abilities [2]  [3] , including appraisals about the meaning of the rival threat to one's self (e.g., self-esteem) and to one's relationship. For example, Lewis [4] has proposed that the emergence of jealousy requires the cognitive ability to reflect on the self and to understand conscious intentions. In addition to assessing jealousy, we used this opportunity to explore attachment style in dogs (and its possible interaction with our conditions), which we mention here for the sake of completeness. We created a scale for owners to complete regarding their dog's attachment style and coded for behaviors that might be linked to different attachment styles. These included behaviors that might be indicative of anxiety (paw slightly raised; yawning) and of submission (ears back, tail down, and licking). We also attempted to code tail wagging to the left vs. the right because work by Quaranta, Siniscalchi, and Vallortigara [20] suggested that the former is associated with withdrawal and the latter with approach. However, our coders found this too difficult to assess via video. Analyses pertaining to attachment style are not reported here given their exploratory nature and the difficulty of measuring some of these behaviors. During the post-interaction period, the owner put the object down and walked away. We coded four behaviors during this phase: 1) aggression/snapping directed at the object; 2) following the owner; 3) observing the object; and 4) ignoring the object. Due to the laborious nature of coding, we only coded for presence/absence of attention behaviors (observing/ignoring object) in this phase rather than assessing attention every 5 seconds as done in the condition phase. Additionally, in the dog condition, we noted if the dog sniffed the rear end of the toy dog. This was included as a measure of whether the dog perceived the stuffed dog as a real dog. The preverbal human infant literature (e.g., by Hart and colleagues) suggests that jealousy produces increased interest and attention toward the mother. We assessed several behaviors pertaining to attention, which included 1) looking at the owner, 2) looking at the rival object, 3) orienting away from the owner, and 4) orienting away from the object. The first two categories were operationally defined as having the head turned and gaze directed toward the owner/object; the later two were operationally defined as having the head and body turned away from the owner/object. Due to their frequency across conditions, a simple present/absent code for the entire interaction period did not adequately capture these behaviors. Therefore, we performed more fined grained coding that consisted of denoting whether the behavior was present or absent every 5 seconds, resulting in total score that ranged from 012. Total scores were then transformed into proportion of time behavior was present. (In the cases where both raters coded the same dog's behavior, the average of the two coders' scores was used for these measures.) The most common category of behavior in owner descriptions of their dogs' jealousy was attention seeking [14] . These behaviors often took the form of pushing the owner or attempting to get between the owner and the rival. We coded for both of these behaviors. Some owners also reported attempts by their dogs to shoo the rival away. In our coding scheme, we operationalized this as the dog pushing against the rival object. Another class of behaviors categorized as attention seeking by Morris et al. [14] was vocalizations (described as barking, growling, and whining), which we assessed. (Growling interrater reliability was lower than our .7 cutoff so was excluded from our analyses.) We coded for aggression given its link to jealousy in human adults [1] and in owners' reports of dog jealousy [14] . Our primary measure of aggression was whether the dog attempted to bite/snap at the object. Coders also attempted to code more subtle signs of aggression that include lip curling (lips being held open with force in order to expose teeth), raised tailholding the tail up between the horizontal and vertical positions (an aggressive posture in wolves), and keeping the ears forward. Interrater reliability was low for ears forward (.57) and so this behavior was not analyzed. Our coders also reported difficulty assessing the raised tail in many dogs due to their physical characteristics (e.g., a clipped tail); however, interrater reliability was acceptable, so these analyses are reported in the results section. Lip curling was not seen across any condition. Two raters, blind to the study's purpose, coded the videos. Unless otherwise noted, behaviors were coded as present or absent and are reported as percent of dogs showing such behaviors per condition. To compute interrater reliability, 29 dogs were coded by both raters. Behaviors in which interrater reliability was lower than .7 were not included in the analyses. For analyses that required whole numbers (i.e., Cochran's Test for presence/absence of a behavior), we used one rater's codes for half the dogs and the other rater's codes for the other half. Behaviors coded during the interaction of the owner with the object are described first, followed by the behaviors coded post-interaction. In the book control condition, owners were instructed to read aloud a children's book, which popped up and played melodies, as if they were reading to a young child. Total amount of time the object made a noise was closely matched to that of the dog condition (approximately 8 secs). Owners were instructed to interact with a realistic-looking stuffed dog that barked, whined, and wagged its tail (which lasted for a total of approximately 8 secs) when a button on the top of its head was pressed. The owners were asked to press the button only once and to interact with the stuffed dog as if they were playing with a real dog. They were also instructed to completely ignore their dog, which was present in the room for the duration of the interaction. Owners were not aware of the hypotheses of the experiment. A within-subjects design was employed with order counter-balanced across participants. Each experimental condition was videotaped and lasted for 1 minute, followed by a 30 sec post-condition phase in which the owner set the object down within reach of the dog. The owner completed a questionnaire after each condition and then the dog and owner were given one minute to freely interact in order to reduce any potential carryover effects from the previous condition. The initial sample size was n = 37. However, one male dog was excluded from all analyses due to a miscommunication between the owner and experimenter resulting in one condition ending prematurely. Therefore, the final sample size was n = 36. The mean age of the dogs was 32.2 months (range = 4135). Equal numbers of male and female dogs participated. The sample consisted of a variety of dog breeds as can be seen in Table 1 . Owners (31 females and 5 males) had owned their dogs an average of 25.4 months (range = 1134). Dogs were tested individually at their homes and had to be less than 35 pounds or shorter than 15 inches. A size criterion was used because of the possibility that the jealousy manipulation would result in aggression and small dogs could be more easily controlled in such circumstances. Upon arrival at the subjects' homes, the experimenter obtained written consent from the dog owners for participation. The experimenter also gave a brief overview of the study stating, For this experiment, we are examining individual differences in dog behavior across various situations. Thus, we'll be asking you to act out various situations in front of your dog, while ignoring him or her, while we film his or her reaction."" The experimenter also said, ""If you think that your dog will act aggressively in this situation, we ask that you and your dog don't participate, but you'll still receive your Experimetrix [course] credit."" All owners chose to continue with the experiment. This research was approved by the University of California San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and by the University of California at San Diego Human Research Protections Program. Owners and pet dogs were recruited from the University of California, San Diego subject pool. Owners received partial course credit in psychology class for participation. Results & Discussion Figure 1 shows the proportion of dogs that engaged in the various behaviors during the interactions with the objects in each condition. Our analyses showed significantly greater aggression in the jealousy condition, Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = 12.80, p< .002. One fourth of the dogs snapped at the object in the jealousy condition but only 1 dog did so in the other two conditions. (Results from follow up McNemar nonparametric tests are presented in Figure 1.) We, however, did not see a difference across conditions in the number of dogs that placed their tails between the vertical and horizontal positions (Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = .67, ns). This may be due to our coders having difficulty accurately assessing tail movement (e.g., in dogs with snipped tails). In the post-interaction phase (when the owner had put the object down), 36% of the dogs snapped at the stuffed dog while snapping behavior in the other conditions was confined to one dog (Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = 20.57, p< .001). The aggression in the jealousy condition is particularly impressive given that we only tested dogs whose owners believed that their dogs would not behave aggressively in novel situations. The next series of analyses examined attention seeking and specifically focused on the behaviors most commonly noted by owners when describing their animals' jealous behaviors [14]. Dogs were significantly more likely to push or touch their owners (Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = 26.87, p< .001) and the object (Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = 24.07, p< .001) in the jealousy condition relative to either the jack-o-lantern or book conditions. Results for follow up McNemar nonparametric tests are presented in Figure 1. Of particular interest, dogs specifically tried to get between the owner and the object more often in the jealousy condition (Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = 6.53, p< .04). Such behaviors aimed at preventing or breaking up a liaison have been hypothesized to be the primary motivational state that accompanies jealousy and that distinguishes jealousy from other emotions such as anger [1], [19]. Although vocalizations during the experiment were relatively infrequent, whining occurred significantly more in the jealousy condition than in the book condition. Barking did not significantly differ across conditions. At the suggestion of a reviewer, we summed the behaviors presented in Figure 1 for each condition in order to get a sense of the effect size of the jealousy condition and performed within-subjects ANOVA with partial eta-squared tests. Partial eta-squared for the dog vs. jack-o-lantern conditions was .41 and for dog vs. book was .58. In the preverbal human infant literature, jealousy is accompanied not only by negative affect but also by heightened interest and attention toward the mother while she is interacting with what appears to be another infant [10][12]. We found similar effects in dogs. Results for within-subject ANOVAs are presented in the text while results for follow up paired t-tests are displayed in Figure 2. As shown in Figure 2, dogs gazed significantly more at their owners (F(2, 70) = 7.47, p< .001, = .18) and the objects (F(2, 70) = 56.39, p< .001, = .62) in the conditions in which the owner was displaying affection towards an object relative to the control condition of reading aloud. Furthermore, when the object of affection appeared to be a conspecific, dogs looked more at the object relative to when it was a novel item (jack-o-lantern). This pattern is furthered supported by the inversely related measures of disinterest, operationally defined by orienting the body away from the owner and object (Figure 2). Dogs spent significantly more time ignoring the owner and object in the book condition relative to the conditions that involved displays of affection: F(2, 70) = 30.62, p< .001, = .47 for owner; F(2, 70) = 87.27, p< .001, = .71 for object. Behaviors during the post-task period were similar to those seen during the actual interaction (although less informative given that behavior was merely coded as present/absent). More dogs ignored the object in the jack-o-lantern (94.4%) and book (91.7%) conditions than in the dog condition (52.8%); Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = 20.01, p< .001. There was also a significant difference in the number of dogs who observed the object across conditions (72.2% in dog condition; 63.9% in jack-o-lantern condition; and 44.4% in book condition): Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = 6.58, p< .04. There was not a significant difference in the number of dogs who followed their owner after each condition, 2 (2) = 4.67, p = .10. Was the stuffed dog perceived as real? One might wonder whether the subject dogs believed that the stuffed animal was a real dog. The data discussed previously, particularly the aggressive behaviors aimed at the stuffed animal, would seem to suggest that they did. Perhaps even more compellingly, 86% of the dogs sniffed the anal region of the toy dog during the experiment or post-experiment phases. Having a faux rival dog enabled us to maximize the amount of control we had in the experiment. That jealousy behaviors were seen under these somewhat impoverished social conditions leads us to predict that such behaviors would be even more enhanced in the present of an actual rival dog who responded to the owner's affectionate displays. In the present work any single behavior might not be indicative of jealousy per se. However, the pattern of behaviors, particularly when dogs were confronted with their owners displaying affection to what appeared to be another dog, is similar to the constellation of behaviors seen in humans. These data thus present a strong case that domestic dogs have a form of jealousy. Individual Differences An anonymous reviewer suggested that our data might reflect individual differences in dog cognition and/or jealousy. One possibility is that only some dogs perceived the stuffed dog as real and that this difference in cognitive ability resulted in jealousy in some dogs but not others. To the reviewer's mind, only those dogs that aggressed against the rival dog can be shown to definitively consider the fake dog stimulus as real. We believe that the fact that the vast majority of the dogs sniffed the anal region of the stuffed dog (including all of the aggressive dogs) suggests that most of the dogs conceptualized the dog as real, but we cannot rule out the reviewer's suggestion. However, even if most dogs perceived the stimulus as real, it is still possible that only some of them reacted with jealousy to it. The reviewer suggested some additional analyses to explore possible individual differences. One question is whether the snapping dogs were the only ones to show additional jealous behaviors. As described below, our data suggest that they were not, although their jealousy might be argued to be more intense in some respects than their nonsnapping peers. In total, 41.7% of dogs snapped during or after their owner interacted with the stuffed dog. We found that these aggressive dogs did display many other jealous behaviors: All of them pushed at the owner and 86.7% pushed at the fake dog during the jealousy interaction. There was also some tendency for these dogs to spend more time (although not significantly so) attending to the owner and the fake dog (and conversely less time ignoring the owner and rival) than nonsnapping dogs. However, not all jealous behaviors were more common in the snapping dogs. Whining was similar across the two types of dogs and while 26.7% of the snapping dogs attempted to get between their owner and the rival dog, 33.3% of the nonaggressive dogs did so. Moreover, many of the nonsnapping dogs also displayed other jealousy indicators. For example, 61.9% pushed at the owner and 57.1% pushed at the stuffed dog. These percents are higher if the dogs that did not sniff the rear end are excluded (who likely did not perceive the stuffed dog as a threat). Thus, these exploratory analyses would argue against the suggestion that only aggressive dogs displayed jealous behaviors, although their jealousy may be viewed as more extreme. These data raise the possibility that dogs, like humans, show individual differences in how jealousy is exhibited, which ranges from attention seeking and restorative behaviors to aggressive acts. The fact some dogs (13.8%) failed to sniff the rear end of the fake dog raises stimulating questions for future studies. Jealous behaviors were infrequent among these animals, suggesting that they were not in an emotional state (e.g., none pushed on the owner or the stuffed dog and only one got between them). One interesting possible avenue for future work is to examine the cognitive abilities that are associated with not believing the stuffed dog is real. It might be that such dogs are less cognitively sophisticated (they do not perceive the toy as representation of a real dog.). However, it is also possible that they are more sophisticated, (i.e., were not fooled into believing that the stuffed dog was genuine, and hence it was not a threat). In sum, it may be that while all dogs have the neurobiological cognitive capacity for jealousy, the current situation may have failed to induce the emotional state in some dogs. Understanding what factors (cognition or social dynamics) contribute to individual differences in dog jealousy would seem a ripe area for future work.",TRUE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dogs-jealousy-study/,Science,Snopes
402,Science Mission Directorate,"Mark your calendars: a series of three supermoons will appear on the celestial stage on December 3, 2017, January 1, 2018, and January 31, 2018. A supermoon is a Moon that is full when it is also at or near its closest point in its orbit around Earth. Since the Moons orbit is elliptical, one side (apogee) is about 30,000 miles (50,000 km) farther from Earth than the other (perigee). Nearby perigee full Moons appear about 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full Moons that occur near apogee in the Moon's orbit. The supermoons are a great opportunity for people to start looking at the Moon, not just that once but every chance they have! says Noah Petro, a research scientist from NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center. Its hard for our eyes to distinguish these small changes in size when the Moon is high amidst the vastness of the night sky. But any time you catch a full Moon as it rises or sets, while its suspended low on the horizon beaming through the silhouettes of trees or buildings, its apparent size might make you do a double-take. You almost feel as though you could reach out, grab the glowing orb, and drop it into your coffee cup. Even more so if its a supermoon. If you can only catch one episode of the supermoon trilogy, catch the third one. It will be extra special. First of all, the January 31st supermoon will feature a total lunar eclipse, with totality viewable from western North America across the pacific to Eastern Asia. The Moons orbit around our planet is tilted so it usually falls above or below the shadow of the Earth. About twice each year, a full Moon lines up perfectly with the Earth and Sun such that Earths shadow totally blocks the Suns light, which would normally reflect off the Moon. The lunar eclipse on January 31 will be visible during moonset. Folks in the Eastern United States, where the eclipse will be partial, will have to get up in the morning to see it, notes Petro. But its another great chance to watch the Moon. The Moon will lose its brightness and take on an eerie, fainter-than-normal glow from the scant sunlight that makes its way through Earths atmosphere. Often cast in a reddish hue because of the way the atmosphere bends the light, totally eclipsed Moons are sometimes called blood Moons. Were seeing all of the Earths sunrises and sunsets at that moment reflected from the surface of the Moon, says Sarah Noble, a Program Scientist at NASA headquarters. The January 31st supermoon will also be the second full Moon of the month. Some people call the second full Moon in a month a Blue Moon, that makes it a super blue Moon. Blue Moons happen every two and a half years, on average. With the total eclipse, itll be a royal spectacle indeed: a super blue blood Moon. Sometimes the celestial rhythms sync up just right to wow us. Heed your calendar reminders. On the three dates marked, step out into the moonset or moonrise and look up for a trilogy of sky watching treats! To learn more about the many wonders of the Moon, go to moon.nasa.gov.

445,The Man Who Named Bluetooth,"Its nearly impossible today to go anywhere without seeing someone talking into a tiny earpiece, but the headsets with blinking blue lights were not so common just a decade ago. Use of Bluetooth-equipped devices has stretched across the globe, yet the technologys origins and name can be traced to an engineer obsessed with making computers function using as little energy as possible. Originally intended as a wireless replacement for cables to connect phones, headsets, computers, keyboards and mice, Bluetooth technology has proliferated over the past decade, allowing devices in close proximity to connect while using very little battery power. The headsets are ubiquitous, but according to the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) they are only one of many product types that make up the 9 billion Bluetooth devices in the world today. That number keeps growing. Over the next 2 years, annual Bluetooth device shipments are expected to double from 2 to 4 billion, according to ABI Research. Intel mobile computing engineer Jim Kardach was instrumental in bringing together Ericsson, IBM, Intel, Nokia and Toshiba to form the Bluetooth SIG in 1998. That group created the universal standard that is used by more than 17,000 member companies. Kardach recalls playing the role of instigator and mediator among the founding companies, but says the group quickly agreed on a common goal to create a small, low-power consuming, low-cost, short-range radio with built-in security and the ability to connect ad hoc with other devices. Inspired by a book about Vikings that he was reading at the time, he came up with the Bluetooth name. Just days before he retired in December, Kardach reflected on his 27-year career at Intel, including the genesis of Bluetooth, the many low-power design breakthroughs that led to 100 patents and his work on the first notebook system-on-chip (SoC) sold in the 1980s by Intel called the 386SL/486SL. How did you get involved with the creation of Bluetooth? I got the assignment in 1997 when my boss at the time came up to me and said, Youre finishing up the ACPI stuff, can you figure out how to integrate wireless into the notebook? We got together Ericsson, Nokia, Toshiba and IBM. That probably represented 60 percent of both the cellphone and notebook markets at the time. The key was to define the goals of what we wanted to do. We formed a SIG, all agreeing that we wanted to build this universal, very low-cost, private, wireless cable. We did it under an open IP (intellectual property) policy, allowing us to take the best pieces from everywhere and put them together. We had goals on what we wanted this thing to cost and strategies for it being built on a bulk CMOS process, which hadnt been done before. It had security, privacy and had to work across the world, so we picked the ISM band, which required fixing some of the regulatory issues around it. We had a term sheet that everyone agreed to and we put it together. Intel became the leader simply because we had IBM and Toshiba who didnt trust each other, and Ericsson and Nokia who didnt trust each other, so we were kind of the Switzerland. How does a chief power architect look at things? Power is one of the key attributes. Battery life is life. Its the life of the product. To ignore that is totally unacceptable. You have to design things to work efficiently, but more importantly, do nothing efficiently. Those are the two rules of power management. We rely on architectural designs to lower power use. We design chips to turn things off and back on only when theyre needed. We architect things to minimize latency and anticipate when something is needed so it gets turned on just in time. We used to rely on randomness, like when you drive to work and hope to miss all of the red lights, but more recently weve purposely tried to line up activities in order to create big idle gaps between these activities. If the idle gaps are long enough, we can shut off all of the power. For example, we now have special offloading accelerators that run to do specialized media loads and then be able to put the rest of the platform to a low-power state, which means 98 percent of it is powered off. Hardware not designed for power management can be like crying babies that wake up the whole house. They ping memory every couple of milliseconds or microseconds, keeping the CPU out of its low-power state. This can keep memory and the busses between them alive. A Bluetooth radio should require about a milliwatt of power, but when you put it on a USB plug, because of the way the bus was architected, it generates an extra 6 watts of power by pinging memory every millisecond. These are things we want to catch up front when architecting for good power management. The fourth-generation Intel Core processors that use an SoC design are coming out soon. Whats the advantage of SoCs over traditional CPU designs? SoC allows you to do things that arent possible if you have a handful of chips from different venders. We have the advantage of doing our own chipsets and CPUs, which allows us to design power management between them and the rest of the platform. In the 1980s I worked on the 3SL and 4SL SoCs. We were doing it in an era where we were cramming hundreds of thousands of transistors on a die and now we can fit billions. We can now take advantage of Moores Law and increased capacity that were getting from bigger wafers and smaller transistors. This lets us integrate more capabilities into a small chip. Having an SoC allows us to bring power management across the platform. With the 3SL, we added new operating modes to the CPU that pulled some power management underneath the operating system. This work is still used today. To design an SoC, sometimes you have to trade off time to market but you can really take advantage of them to manage power consumption.

Now about the water receding....that has happened before in acklins in 1936 and this by the way is not a normal phenomena but has happened several times before but it is due to the hurricane. What happened in this case was that the low pressure of the hurricane pushed down on the water in the eye and eye wall of the hurricane which is a low pressure system at at the center of the storm which gives you the high l ... evel storm surge but in nature the is a never ending process of trying or forcing to maintain a perfect because at the center the water height is pretty high and Irma had 15-20 ft storm surge but that water which produces this bulging effect takes water from its surroundings to be transferred into the eye so the water receding is part of this storm.

976,"Lunar Eclipse, Comet, and Snow Moon Coming in February 2017","On 10 February 2017, sky watchers will experience a confluence of three celestial events in the same night: a penumbral lunar eclipse, a snow moon, and a comet. The lunar eclipse will be somewhat less spectacular than the image usually conjured up by that term: This weekends event is whats known as a penumbral lunar eclipse, a much more subtle counterpart to the dramatic total eclipse. As the moon rises on Friday, it will pass through the outer edge of the Earths shadow, called the penumbra. During these type of eclipses, you will see a darkening of the moon from the bottom edge moving towards the top as the night progresses but not a total lunar blackout. The eclipse will begin around 5:45 p.m. ET (4:45 p.m. CT)  shortly before moonrise  and end at around 9:50 p.m. ET (8:50 p.m. CT). The best viewing time will be around 7:45 p.m. ET (6:45 p.m. CT). You can see all the time information from NASA here. A penumbral eclipse is less striking than a full or partial lunar eclipse, in which the moon turns blood red or appears to have had a bite taken out of it. Instead, in a penumbral eclipse, observers may notice only a darkening of the moons face: In a total eclipse of the moon, the inner part of Earths shadow, called the umbra, falls on the moons face. At mid-eclipse, the entire moon is in shadow, which may appear blood red. In a partial lunar eclipse, the umbra takes a bite out of only a fraction of the moon. The dark bite grows larger, and then recedes, never reaching the total phase. In a penumbral lunar eclipse, only the more diffuse outer shadow of Earth falls on the moons face. This third kind of lunar eclipse is much more subtle, and much more difficult to observe, than either a total or partial eclipse of the moon. There is never a dark bite taken out of the moon, as in a partial eclipse. The eclipse never progresses to reach the dramatic minutes of totality. At best, at mid-eclipse, very observant people will notice a dark shading on the moons face. Others will look and notice nothing at all. The full moon aspect of this trifecta isnt really unusual at all, since lunar eclipses can only occur when the moon is full. News accounts having been playing up the fact that this full moon will be a snow moon, but thats simply the traditional name given to the full moon that occurs every February in North America (due to its coincidence with snow and cold air temperatures). If thats not enough, a green-hued comet will also hurtle past Earth in the early morning hours of 11 February 2017. According to Sky & Telescope the comet, 45P/Honda-Mrkos-Pajdusakova, will zoom by the planet at 3 a.m. EST at a distance of 7.7 million miles:",TRUE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/lunar-eclipses-full-moons/,Science,Snopes

""We must have American dominance in space. Very importantly, I'm hereby directing the Department of Defense and Pentagon to immediately begin the process necessary to establish the Space Force as the sixth branch of the armed forces.

""We are going to have the Air Force and we are going to have the Space Force: separate but equal, it is going to be something so important,"" he said. The term ""separate but equal"" became a legal precedent following an 1896 Supreme Court ruling Plessy v. Ferguson that said the use of racially separate facilities, if equal, was not discrimination. That legal rationale was deemed unconstitutional through a series of Supreme Court decisions, ending with 1954's Brown v. Board of Education.

6110,Evidence Emerges That Hawaii Eruptions Caused By Fracking,"Scientific data has linked the surge in volcanic activity in Hawaii to increased fracking activity at Puna Geothermal Venture. The data shows how the fracking may have been deliberately designed to create a geological process by which lava would drain from Kilaueas summit into the East Rift Zone so as to create large new vents that would destabilize the geology, and trigger a major collapse in the Hilina Fault System. Exopolitics.org reports: A video prepared by Pacific Tsunamic Warning Center clearly shows that the epicenter of earthquake activity centered in the lower Puna region is adjacent to the Puna Geothermal Venture. The following map from the video depicts all the earthquakes and the eruption site for the recent lava outbreak from 30 April to 6 May. The eruption occurs mainly in Leilani Estates, which is right next to the Puna Geothermal Venture. The following map by the US Geological Service shows where the Puna Geothermal Venture (marked PGV) is in relation to the current volcanic eruption. Heres a photo showing the lava outbreak and its very close proximity to the Puna Geothermal Venture (circled in red) on May 22. Since then, it has begun flowing onto the property, but still not reached any of the wells. The scientific data clearly shows how the Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV) is at the epicenter of the volcanic eruption. Is this merely chance or by design? In my previous article and video published on May 15, I wrote about how the fracking activity at PGV has been scientifically linked to earthquakes. The following diagram was included which clearly showed the strong correlation: Since the publication of my article, there have been other articles linking the fracking at PGV with earthquakes, and also raising the question of whether the fracking caused the volcanic eruption. The most prominent one has come from Jon Rappoport, who wrote a May 22 article on his blogsite titled: Did fracking cause the Hawaii volcano eruption? In my May 15 article and video , I mentioned the Hilina Slump and how it may have been related to the fracking occurring at PGV. This has led to much criticism in the videos comments section, but the scientific facts do show that earthquake activity is related to movements in the Hilina Fault System. Heres a map showing the Hilina Fault System in relation to the East Rift Zone. The following map produced by the Hawaii Volcano Observatory shows how the recent earthquake activity led to the Hilina Slump slipping towards the Pacific Ocean Observatory by about two meters, which is massive in geological terms. While the earthquakes under the summit and under the eruption center at the eastern end of the rift zone are generated by the movement of magma, the big event and its aftershocks under the pali have a different origin. This becomes obvious in Figure 2 [reproduced above]. It shows how the permanent GPS stations installed and operated by the Hawaii Volcano Observatory moved in response to the 6.9 quake. The red arrows indicate the direction of horizontal motion and all of them point to the southeast. The length of each arrow represents the extent of the motion with the longest ones having moved by more than 2 feet. This shows that the flank of the cliff on the southern coast of Hawaii has moved further towards the ocean. What the article didnt mention was that the 6.9 quake on May 4 was triggered by the massive outflow of lava from Kilauea Summit, Halemaumau crater, into the East Rift Zone. Basically, the volcanic eruption in the Lower Puna region (where the Puna Geothermal Venture is located) is being fueled by fresh lava from the summit of Kileaua, which is being drained towards it. While it began slowly as old lava oozed out of the new volcanic fissures in Leilani Estates, the recent upsurge is a result of fresh new lava arriving from the Kilauea Summit. The Honolulu Advertise r explained the process: The first weeks of the eruption saw pasty, crumbly, slower-moving aa lava oozing slowly through the fissures. But that changed Friday afternoon, scientists said, when preliminary results from a testing sample showed a different composite of lava, the smoother pahoehoe variety that is generally fresher, hotter and faster. The following diagram shows the dynamics of the lava flows linking Kilauea Summit, the PuuOo Vent, and the East Rift Zone. An article by Scott Johnson in Ars Technica, explained the process as follows: Klaueas main magma chamber seems to be a few kilometers below Halemaumau Crater at its summit. When the volcanos guts gurgle with a new injection of magma from below, the lava lake in Halemaumau Crater rises. The conduits and crevices that constitute Klaueas plumbing extend from the summit region over to the East Rift Zone. So after lava rises in Halemaumau Crater, the lake sometimes drains back down as the new magma moves on toward the eastern section of the volcano. This is where we finally get to the issue of whether the fracking at Puna Geothermal Venture was secretly an attempt to weaken the underlying geology in order to create a path for fresh lava to drain from Kilauea summit into the East Rift Zone. As the following diagram of the East Rift Zone illustrates, lava follows the path of least resistance in a highly pressurized environment. This principle would be well known to any geologist, or plumber if we use Johnsons analogy. This means that some would have been aware from the inception of the PGV in 1993, that the process of using highly pressurized water on subterranean rocks (aka fracking), severely compromising the underground environment, would effectively open up a new path for lava to flow from the Kilauea summit and the PuuOo Vent Apparently, this is exactly what was planned by those behind the Puna Geothermal Venture according to Paul Collin , who has strong ties to the U.S. intelligence community: It is understood that Hawaiis geothermal power company Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV) purposefully drilled wells and fracked into the ground in such a way that lava from Earths mantle would eventually be redirected to open-up and spout a brand new volcano within the island of Hawaii, and sure enough facts set forth by a USGS chart and briefing that lava has now been routed right along the same linear path south-east, which actually punched-out a brand new caldera volcano within the Lower East Rift Zone adjacent to the extremely weak debris landmass known as the Hilani Slump consisting of 10% of Hawaiis southeastern land mass that was already slipping into the Pacific Ocean without the new lava delta growing huger; about 400 meters per hour on land (alone)  threatening a tsunami event from coast to coast. In my May 15 article, I described how the creation of a massive tsunami through a collapse of the Hilina slump was the secret purpose behind the creation of the Puna Geothermal Venture, whose owners are linked to the Rothschild family. I wish to state for the record that I dont believe the plan will succeed, and that the hoped-for megatsunami that would cripple the United States economically and militarily for decades to come will not occur. However, it is vitally important to expose this plan was and who is behind it. My view is that the Rothschild family has chosen China as the hub for the kind of New World Order that the Deep State/global elite would like to emerge. That would be an openly authoritarian state where AI technology is used to monitor citizens and quickly remove troublemakers expressing dissenting political views. The United States is the main obstacle to such an authoritarian New World Order being created, and secret geo-engineering was therefore undertaken in Hawaii that would create a megatsunami via a major collapse of the Hilina fault system. If the plan had worked, then it is not hard to see how the U.S. would have been unable to prevent a New World Order emerging  based on Chinas authoritarian socio-political model masked behind AI technology designed to appeal to a tech savvy Millennial generation. It is also important to mention that this is the second time in 2018 that Hawaii was targeted by the Deep State/global elites for some kind of catastrophic event that would economically and militarily weaken the United States. On January 13, 2018, a ballistic nuclear missile was sent by a secret CIA linked Navy, called the Dark Fleet, in a false flag attack that was meant to embroil the United States in a catastrophic nuclear war. In a January 20 article , I provided documents and references showing how the CIA has built its own secret fleet that conducts covert operations on behalf of the Deep State/global elite. Thankfully, that plan failed due to the intervention of a U.S. Air Force based secret space program that shot down the missile, as I discussed another article Since 2004, I have lived on Hawaiis Big Island. On May 1, 2018, I moved from the lower Puna region just as the earthquakes intensified, to the Kona side of the Big Island. It boggles the mind that such a beautiful part of our planet is being repeatedly targeted by the global elite for catastrophes that will facilitate their New World Order plans. I sincerely hope that appropriate legal and political action is taken against: all those behind the Puna Geothermal Venture for their role in the devastation that is being caused in the lower Puna region by their secret fracking; the local County officials that were likely bribed to remain silent over the risk of permitting such a venture; and also against the global elites who put together such a nefarious plan. .",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/did-fracking-cause-volcanic-activity-hawaii/,Science,Snopes

6333,POLITICS: Lawmaker says tumbling rocks are causing seas to rise,"Correction appended. The Earth is not warming. The White Cliffs of Dover are tumbling into the sea and causing sea levels to rise. Global warming is helping grow the Antarctic ice sheet. Those are some of the skeptical assertions echoed by Republicans on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee yesterday. The lawmakers at times embraced research that questions mainstream climate science during a hearing on how technology can be used to address global warming. A leading climate scientist testifying before the panel spent much of the two hours correcting misstatements. The purpose of the hearing was to focus on how technology could be deployed for climate change adaptation. But the hearing frequently turned to the basics of climate science. Many of the questions by Republicans and Democrats alike were directed to Philip Duffy, president of the Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts and former senior adviser to the U.S. Global Change Research Program. Advertisement Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) said he was bothered that established climate science has not been questioned more by the committee, which has accused federal climate scientists of fraudulently manipulating climate data and subpoenaed their records. ""I'm a little bit disturbed by, No. 1, over and over again, I hear, 'Don't ever talk about whether mankind is the main cause of the temperature changing and the climate changing,'"" he said. ""That's a little disturbing to hear constantly beaten into our heads in a Science Committee meeting, when basically we should all be open to different points of view."" Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), chairman of the committee, entered into the record an opinion piece published in The Wall Street Journal yesterday that claimed sea levels are not rising because of climate change, a view that rejects thousands of scientific studies. The piece was written by Fred Singer, who is affiliated with the Heartland Institute, which promotes the rejection of mainstream climate science. ""To solve climate change challenges, we first need to acknowledge the uncertainties that exist,"" Smith said in his opening remarks. ""Then we can have confidence that innovations and technology will enable us to mitigate any adverse consequences of climate change."" At one point, Smith showed a slide of two charts that he said demonstrated how the rate of sea-level rise does not equal the sharp spike in the consumption of fossil fuels. When Smith pointed out that rates of sea-level rise have only increased slightly compared with the rate of fossil fuel use, Duffy pointed out that his chart was from a single tide gauge station, near San Francisco, and that sea levels rise at different rates around the world. Smith did not show rising atmospheric CO2 levels or temperatures, both of which have climbed steadily in recent decades as emissions have increased. ""The rate of global sea-level rise has accelerated and is now four times faster than it was 100 years ago,"" Duffy told Smith in response to the charts. ""Is this chart inaccurate, then?"" Smith asked. ""It's accurate, but it doesn't represent what's happening globally; it represents what's happening in San Francisco,"" Duffy said. Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) questioned Duffy on the factors that contribute to sea-level rise, pointing out that land subsidence plays a role, as well as human activity. Brooks then said that erosion plays a significant role in sea-level rise, which is not an idea embraced by mainstream climate researchers. He said the California coastline and the White Cliffs of Dover tumble into the sea every year, and that contributes to sea-level rise. He also said that silt washing into the ocean from the world's major rivers, including the Mississippi, the Amazon and the Nile, is contributing to sea-level rise. ""Every time you have that soil or rock or whatever it is that is deposited into the seas, that forces the sea levels to rise, because now you have less space in those oceans, because the bottom is moving up,"" Brooks said. Duffy responded: ""I'm pretty sure that on human time scales, those are minuscule effects."" Brooks added that Antarctic ice is growing. That was true a few years ago, and scientists say it does not disprove the theory of global warming because different factors affect the Arctic and Antarctic rates of melting. ""We have satellite records clearly documenting a shrinkage of the Antarctic ice sheet and an acceleration of that shrinkage,"" Duffy said. ""I'm sorry, but I don't know where you're getting your information, but the data I have seen suggests  "" Brooks said. Duffy answered: ""The National Snow and Ice Data Center and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration."" ""Well, I've got a NASA base in my district, and apparently, they're telling you one thing and me a different thing,"" Brooks said. ""But there are plenty of studies that have come that show with respect to Antarctica that the total ice sheet, particularly that above land, is increasing, not decreasing. Now, you could make a different argument if you want to talk about Greenland or the Arctic."" Earlier this year, NASA researchers determined that Antarctica's ice loss has accelerated in the last decade. More broadly, sea ice extent at both poles set a record low last year. Scientists are racing to better understand the changes occurring in Antarctica because much of its ice is land-based, meaning it could drive sea-level rise around the world as it melts. Rep. Bill Posey (R-Fla.) said scientists said in the 1970s that the Earth was cooling, a popular talking point of climate skeptics and the subject of a fake Time magazine cover that has become a meme. Duffy corrected him and said that was essentially an outlier position at the time and that scientists long ago determined that humans were warming the planet. Posey also asked how carbon dioxide could be captured in permafrost in the periods before humans existed. Duffy told him that it was from non-decayed organic matter. Human activity is now causing the Arctic to warm and thaw the ground, releasing the carbon into the atmosphere, Duffy said. Posey then asked about theories related to warming being beneficial for habitats and to people. ""What do you say to people who theorize that the Earth as it continues to warm is returning to its normal temperature?"" Posey asked. ""Look, if you want to characterize a temperature above today's temperature as normal, you're free to do that, but that doesn't mean that's a planet we want to live on,"" Duffy said. ""I don't want to get philosophical; I'm trying to stay on science here,"" Posey said. ""I'm not getting philosophical; I'm getting extremely practical,"" Duffy said. ""I'm being extremely practical  if we let the planet warm 2 or 3 degrees, we will have tens of meters of sea-level rise, and the community where I live will essentially cease to exist."" Posey responded: ""I don't think anybody disputes that the Earth is getting warmer; I think what's not clear is the exact amount of who caused what, and getting to that is, I think, where we're trying to go with this committee.""

6480,Your Body Is Younger Than You Think,"Most molecules in a cell are constantly being replaced but the DNA is not. All the carbon-14 in a cell's DNA is acquired on the cell's birth date, the day its parent cell divided. Hence the extent of carbon-14 enrichment could be used to figure out the cell's age, Dr. Frisen surmised. In practice, the method has to be performed on tissues, not individual cells, because not enough carbon-14 gets into any single cell to signal its age. Dr. Frisen then worked out a scale for converting carbon-14 enrichment into calendar dates by measuring the carbon-14 incorporated into individual tree rings in Swedish pine trees. Having validated the method with various tests, he and his colleagues have reported in the July 15 issue of Cell the results of their first tests with a few body tissues. Cells from the muscles of the ribs, taken from people in their late 30's, have an average age of 15.1 years, they say. The epithelial cells that line the surface of the gut have a rough life and are known by other methods to last only five days. Ignoring these surface cells, the average age of those in the main body of the gut is 15.9 years, Dr. Frisen found. The Karolinska team then turned to the brain, the renewal of whose cells has been a matter of much contention. Prevailing belief, by and large, is that the brain does not generate new neurons after its structure is complete, except in two specific regions, the olfactory bulb that mediates the sense of smell, and the hippocampus where initial memories of faces and places are laid down. This consensus view was challenged a few years ago by Elizabeth Gould of Princeton, who reported finding new neurons in the cerebral cortex, along with the elegant idea that each day's memories might be recorded in the neurons generated that day. Dr. Frisen's method will enable all regions of the brain to be dated to see if any new neurons are generated. So far he has tested only cells from the visual cortex. He finds these are exactly the same age as the individual, showing that new neurons are not generated after birth in this region of the cerebral cortex, or at least not in significant numbers. Cells of the cerebellum are slightly younger than those of the cortex, which fits with the idea that the cerebellum continues developing after birth.

The conventional view that it does not has recently been challenged by Dr. Piero Anversa of the New York Medical College in Valhalla. Dr. Frisen has found the heart as a whole is generating new cells but he has not yet measured the turnover rate of the heart's muscle cells. Although people may think of their body as a fairly permanent structure, most of it is in a state of constant flux as old cells are discarded and new ones generated in their place. Each kind of tissue has its own turnover time, depending in part on the workload endured by its cells. The cells lining the stomach, as mentioned, last only five days. The red blood cells, bruised and battered after traveling nearly 1,000 miles through the maze of the body's circulatory system, last only 120 days or so on average before being dispatched to their graveyard in the spleen. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The epidermis, or surface layer of the skin, is recycled every two weeks or so. The reason for the quick replacement is that ""This is the body's saran wrap, and it can be easily damaged by scratching, solvents, wear and tear,"" says Elaine Fuchs, an expert on the skin's stem cells at Rockefeller University. As for the liver, the detoxifier of all the natural plant poisons and drugs that pass a person's lips, its life on the chemical warfare front is quite short. An adult human liver probably has a turnover time of 300 to 500 days, says Markus Grompe, an expert on the liver's stem cells at the Oregon Health & Science University. Other tissues have lifetimes measured in years, not days, but are still far from permanent. Even the bones endure nonstop makeover. The entire human skeleton is thought to be replaced every 10 years or so in adults, as twin construction crews of bone-dissolving and bone-rebuilding cells combine to remodel it. About the only pieces of the body that last a lifetime, on present evidence, seem to be the neurons of the cerebral cortex, the inner lens cells of the eye and perhaps the muscle cells of the heart. The inner lens cells form in the embryo and then lapse into such inertness for the rest of their owner's lifetime that they dispense altogether with their nucleus and other cellular organelles. But if the body remains so perpetually youthful and vigorous, and so eminently capable of renewing its tissues, why doesn't the regeneration continue forever? Some experts believe the root cause is that the DNA accumulates mutations and its information is gradually degraded. Others blame the DNA of the mitochondria, which lack the repair mechanisms available for the chromosomes. A third theory is that the stem cells that are the source of new cells in each tissue eventually grow feeble with age. ""The notion that stem cells themselves age and become less capable of generating progeny is gaining increasing support,"" Dr. Frisen said. He hopes to see if the rate of a tissue's regeneration slows as a person ages, which might point to the stem cells as being what one unwetted heel was to Achilles, the single impediment to immortality.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/does-body-replace-itself-seven-years/,Science,Snopes
7131,"Sex Robots That Can Cook, Clean Efficiently Will Be Available By 2019","WORLDWIDE  According to reports, tech companies that are producing realistic sex robots are trying to reach the next level in creating sex robots that can cook and clean. Company spokespersons say the cooking and cleaning sex robots can be available for purchase as soon as next year. Sex Robots have become a very hot topic, both criticized and praised. Many think sex robots will have a negative impact on society and sex life, as people may choose sex robots over actual people. With many people on Twitter making jokes about how sex robots cannot cook and clean, unfortunately for them, cleaning and cooking sex robots is already happening. Ive dated around six women in my entire life says Jan Kunchai, an engineer at RealBotix, and all six cheated on me, Im six for six like Jordan. Anyways i thought it would be a good idea to create a robot that can cook and clean so i dont have to get cheated on anymore, the next step would probably be a sex robot that can reproduce. Although a sex robot that can cook and clean efficiently seems like a very difficut task, company engineers say they can be here by 2019. Will you be purchasing one of these robots?

7267,Eating alligator in New Orleans could help save the wetlands of Louisiana,"American alligator 8 million years first protected Endangered Species Preservation Act in 66 Thehas remained nearly untouched by evolution for the last. It has hunted in the Southeastern wetlands as an apex predator, unaffected by sea levels or fluctuating temperatures. Nearly hunted to extinction by 1950, alligators were one of thespecies in 1962. They helped usher in the creation of theand by 1987, the alligator had become a rousing success story, pronounced fully recovered.With healthy levels returned, they demonstrated the programs effectiveness and future promise. Today, the American alligators story is experiencing another plot twist. Cavan The American alligator has been so protected, its now over-populated, said Nathan Richard, the executive chef ofin New Orleans. Hes both passionate and creative when it comes to cooking alligator  hes done nose-to-tail preparations and hosted a vanishing wetlands supper series. For Richard, normalizing this protein on menus again is essential to protecting the Louisiana wetlands. Too many alligators means too many fish and turtles being killed, he said, as we tucked into a bowl of his incredible curry piquant. Fried alligator tenderloin was slathered in a coconut sauce, made from hot red curry, fish sauce, soy, sliced ginger and gochujang paste. It was fragrant and spicy, bringing both moments of classic Louisiana flavor with intense notes of Southeast Asian cuisine. A perfectly crackled exterior resembled fried chicken, but the meat within was more akin in consistency to a super-tender octopus. The interior at Cavan Sara Essex Bradley This overpopulation also means a physical destruction of the marshes and the destruction of fishing traps and bait, said Richard. Thats a problem for the commercial fishermen. Our wetlands and marshes are our first line of defense against hurricanes, and without them, the flooding will become even more extreme. While Richard is not the only man cooking gator in New Orleans, hes likely one of the few chefs of his caliber with such a hands-on approach to the animal in the wild. Boating through the bayou in Louisiana Jenny Adams/Mic Ive been hunting alligator since I was a kid growing up in Thibodaux, Louisiana, he said. Alligator is not only high-protein and low-fat, its also able to be sustainably sourced. The way we trap them, theres no pain or stress until the moment its killed. If you do it right, its very, very fast. And if you do it wrong? I asked. If you hunt alligator wrong, youre in big trouble, he said with a laugh. The sound fits his massive frame  when hes not hunting gator, Richards is a volunteer fireman. His exploration of new ways to cook alligator continues to excite guests whove come to love the meat. Its far beyond fried alligator bites in a basket  a common sight in the city. I learned from Australian crocodile recipes that you can do a baby-back ribs, he said. When I worked at Kingfish, I hosted nose-to-tail dinners. For those, I broke down an entire alligator and prepared each part differently. The cheek is delicious, but the liver is totally inedible. His grits and alligator grillades arrived on the Cavan menu this winter, with pan-fried cutlets cooked in bacon fat and braised in a reduction of celery, onions, bell pepper and garlic  served over stone-ground, mascarpone and edam cheese grits. Chef Nathan Richard at Cavan Cavan I was eager to get a more up-close-and-personal look at the wetlands, and, admittedly, at the alligators. It turns out, a lot of people are similarly inclined and hunting (with professionals) is now a tourism activity. Cypress Point Richard has become friends with a biologist and conservationist, Dr. Ray J. Matherne, the owner of a 1,700-acre wetland preserve about 30 minutes from New Orleans in Bayou Des Allemands. Matherne has spent a lifetime studying this ecosystem and today takes guests on tours, crawfish harvests. In September  the only month alligator hunting is legal  hell even take guests on two-day alligator hunts. Theres no place to stay directly on his property, but the drive isnt too long from New Orleans. 40% of all the wetlands in the U.S United States Geological Survey Louisianas 3 million acres of wetlands represent. According to the, they are being lost at a rate of 75 square kilometers annually. In Des Allemands and other bayous like it, you add in the overpopulation of an apex predator into the equation and the effects are deeply felt. The wetlands at Cypress Point Jenny Adams/Mic Thirty years ago, the demand for hides was tremendous, Matherne said, as we set out in a duo of small, battered outboards, not quite as long as a fully grown gator. But with the anti-fur movement, it has dropped considerably. Now, we hunt for population control and we hunt to save the wetlands. Theres no doubt hunting also benefits these bayou communities in other ways  from the processors to locals who have their own, day-to-day issues with this overpopulation. Hes an expert on the area. You can see egrets, heron, ibis and even bald eagles nesting, he said. And we do a private alligator harvest, a crawfish harvest, fishing, duck hunting and bass fishing. Mathernes preserve has Spanish moss dripping dreamily off cypress, gum, and oak trees. Its easy to forget we are here for a hunt  the first of a two-day hunt is rather relaxing. We set traps using 12-foot long willow poles with a long, nylon rope tied to both ends. The poles are planted at a 45-degree angle deep into the mud. On the top of each pole, a piece of raw chicken hangs from a massive, metal hook dangling about a foot off the water. The alligators begin their own hunt at dusk. Sniffing the rotten meat, they burst from the water to swallow the it whole, settling on the mud below to digest  without noticing that theyve swallowed a hook and line, too. The alligators from the hunt before they are processed Jenny Adams/Mic Lets say we never came back, said Matherne on the second day of our hunt. It would do them no harm. An alligators digestive system is so acidic, its strong enough to dissolve a hubcap. In a matter of days, it would all dissolve, and the alligator would swim away. A missing chicken alerts us we might have a gator. Richard stands in the boat, hauling the pole and line upwards. Another hunter stands alongside him with a rifle pointed at the water. Its mere seconds before an 11-foot alligator rises to the surface, suddenly furious and thrashing. The water is boiling and the boats are rocking with considerable force. Birds go screaming from the tree canopy. If you need anything to hunt an alligator, I realize, its an incredible trifecta of balance, bravery and marksmanship  falling in would likely mean death. A quick bullet is fired into the center of alligators the head, and just like that, the swamp goes quiet again.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/will-eating-alligator-save-wetlands/,Science,Snopes

7391,Cellphones driving modern humans to the brink of insanity? New science reveals young brains DERANGED by cellphone radiation exposure,"is there a common cause behind the insanity? Natural News ) Its fairly obvious to most intelligent people that modern society is going insane . Its especially true among todays hyper-connected youth who seem to be truly deranged and mentally ill, hyperventilating over every issue imaginable such as net neutrality or the election of Donald Trump. The lunacy of modern society has never been more extreme, and many of us who observe all this are wondering As it turns out, the mass poisoning of human brains with cellphone radiation has only been going on for a generation or so. It may be the common cause behind the insanity, and California health authorities have just confirmed this possibility by issuing new warnings about the adverse brain effects of cellphone radiation exposure. directly interfere with normal brain function, leading people to demonstrate abnormal cognitive function. This, combined with the brain-warping harmful effects of social media, seems to have driven our society to the brink of runaway mental illness across the masses. The research suggests cellphones could increase our risk for brain cancer and tumors, low sperm count, headaches, as well as impaired memory, hearing, and sleep, reports CBS News / San Francisco . In other words, cellphone radiation has been found to, leading people to demonstrate abnormal cognitive function. This, combined with the brain-warping harmful effects of social media, seems to have driven our society to the brink of runaway mental illness across the masses. Just as the Romans destroyed their civilization with the help of lead poisoning in the water aqueducts, we may be destroying our own civilization by frying all our brains with cellphone radiation (and thereby driving our people insane). Cellphone radiation brain damage explains how snowflakes and crybullies came into existence According to the article linked above, 95 percent of Americans are now using cellphones on a regular basis. This is even true among todays youth who seem to be addicted to the devices (as portals for social media chats, photo sharing and the like). But is all this device time frying young brains and interfering with neurological development? Could cellphone radiation exposure, in other words, be responsible for the snowflake generation of fragile crybullies and emotional wrecks that now seem to dominate college campuses across our nation? A new documentary called Generation Zapped looks at the stunning health risks associated with wireless technology and mobile devices. Found at GenerationZapped.com , the new documentary dares to examine the medical and health implications of prolonged cellphone radiation exposure. See the trailer here: Sorry This video does not exist. The documentary also covers smart meters and how they expose entire buildings full of people to electromagnetic radiation pollution. The wireless industry is the new Big Tobacco Inherent in the film is coverage of the massive scientific cover-up being waged by the industry. Were talking about a Big Tobacco-style cover-up of scientific evidence of harm. Powerful corporations that are deeply invested in wireless technology spend billions of dollars each year lobbying lawmakers and regulators to bury the truth about electropollution and the risk of EMF exposure. Thats why this film and its producers will, of course, be maliciously attacked by the wireless industry in exactly the same way big tobacco whistleblowers were attacked by the cigarette companies throughout the 1970s, 80s and 90s. (Its also why the vaccine industry viciously attacks anyone who points out how vaccines contain brain-damaging aluminum and mercury.) When the truth threatens a multi-billion-dollar industry, the truth is always attacked and suppressed, and such suppression of truth is always dressed up in the name of science. But its all fake science, of course. Or, better stated, industry science  which isnt actually science at all. Its just propaganda. Have we allowed an entire generation to be brain damaged by cellphones? The bigger question here, however, is what Im posing today: By ignoring the very real health risks of brain damage caused by cellphone radiation exposure, have we allowed an entire generation to become brain damaged? Its hard to look at snowflakes today and not conclude they are mentally deranged lunatics. See the videos below for some examples: As these videos demonstrate, a shocking number of todays youthful people are nothing short of raging lunatics. This is especially evident in the LGBT / trans community, which is now expanding its tolerance acronyms to include men who enjoy having intercourse with the tailpipes of automobiles . Every freakish, deranged sexual deviancy is now claimed to be a protected victim group, and theres no question the deranged Left will soon demand special protection for bestiality, pedophilia and those who engage in sexual acts with corpses. (Love wins! Um dude, maybe that isnt the kind of love you should be looking for) The political Left in America, in other words, is now trying to normalize mass mental illness for the simple reason that it has become so widespread that it almost seems common. But common doesnt make it normal or healthy. If an entire generation is mass poisoned, that doesnt make them all sane. It just means that the brain damage is extremely widespread (and therefore extremely dangerous to the long-term sustainability of society as a whole because no society that goes collectively insane has much of a future). The lunatic fringe of Americas culture, in other words, has found strength in numbers as more and more of our youth are becoming brain damaged by exposure to neurological poisons. These poisons no doubt also include pesticides in the food supply, but EMF pollution is rapidly emerging as perhaps the most damaging factor of all. Is it time to ban mobile devices for young people? Modern society has long agreed that cigarettes should be banned for young people because of the harm they cause young, developing bodies and brains. Today nobody argues that children should be able to buy a pack of Camels (although this was, of course, the big push by the tobacco industry decades ago). Now that science has confirmed cellphones pose a very real risk to the brains of young people, is it time to debate banning such devices from being habitually used by young people? The libertarian argument, of course, is, No way! Government has no role banning people from using cellphones at any age, they say. But what if cellphone use is proven to cause brain damage and mental illness? Then the argument becomes the same argument as the Big Tobacco scenario. At what point should the freedom of individuals be curtailed in the interests of protecting young people from severe brain damage caused by the use of certain products? Meth is currently illegal, by the way, for precisely this reason: It is widely known to be extremely damaging to human biology (and neurology). If harmful cellphones are legal for children to use, why dont the freedom argument people argue the same reasoning for meth use by children, too? Granted, there is a huge disparity between the severity of harm caused by meth vs. cellphones, but theres no question they both cause some degree of harm. How much harm are we as a society going to say is okay for children when theres a better option of causing no harm at all? This article isnt the right place to debate this issue, which is why Im primarily just raising the question here for future debate. Personally, I think parents who allow their children to acquire and use cellphones at any age under 12 years old are extremely irresponsible and causing serious long-term damage to their children. But the social pressure for all children to acquire such devices and use them for social conformity behaviors (i.e. snapchatting all their friends every 25 seconds to fit in) is overwhelming, so its easy to see why so many parents cave in and give their children mobile devices at increasingly young ages. Its time, I think, to start questioning the wisdom of such tolerance. Now that we know cellphones definitely cause long-term brain damage, we must debate this issue for the sake of all future children who may be unknowingly harming themselves with lifelong brain damage. Follow more news on all this at EMF.news and Brain.news . And check out the new film at GenerationZapped.com Its clear that something is damaging the brains of our youth",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/cell-phone-cause-brain-damage/,Science,Snopes
7420,this is bizarre: think twice about drinking Aquafina - The Hull Truth,"Re: this is bizarre: think twice about drinking Aquafina Quote: LI Sound Grunt - 7/27/2008 5:13 AM Its all pressure. I have noticed with beer in freezers - apparantly the amount of liquid varies slightly and so does the bottling pressure. The higher pressures keep the crystals from forming. This happens only with crystaline solids. Water fortunately is one of the few. If it was a non crystaline solid - and took up less space when solidified (molecules closer together) - we would have to learn to skate at the bottom of the ponds. Hydro - that's interesting. I would have thought that the tap water would be ""purer"" or at least lower bacteria - due to the chlorine. This is why,when we do buy the bottled waters, we try to get the city water source stuff like aqua and disanti. Is that true in general - or does it vary with source brand and batch? Also, does the spring water last as long? Is there any purification or such done to those brands? A guy named Hydro has to know this stuff, you know... I don't have any idea how or if spring water companies process their water before bottling, but i have to believe at least some disinfection would be required on the bottling equipment, if nothing else. When our staff take water samples for volatile organic compounds (benzene, chlorinated solvents, etc.) a ""trip blank"" has to accompany those samples in order to make sure the samples haven't been contaminated during shipping and handling. We try to use ultra-pure distilled water from the lab, but sometimes that is not available, so the lab tested some of the commonly available bottled waters for VOCs. I can't say which one was the best, but Captain Sid may be on to something.I don't have any idea how or if spring water companies process their water before bottling, but i have to believe at least some disinfection would be required on the bottling equipment, if nothing else.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/aquafina-bottled-water-not-freeze/,Science,Snopes
7494,When chocolate will go extinct,"Innovative Genomics Institute / University of California at Berkeley Cacao plants are slated to disappear by as early as 2050 thanks to warmer temperatures and dryer weather conditions. Scientists at the University of California are teaming up with Mars company to try to save the crop before it's too late. They're exploring the possibility of using the gene-editing technology CRISPR to make crops that can survive the new challenges. Beyond the glittery glass-and-sandstone walls of the University of Californias new biosciences building, rows of tiny green cacao seedlings in refrigerated greenhouses await judgment day. Under the watchful eye of Myeong-Je Cho , the director of plant genomics at an institute that's working with food and candy company Mars, the plants will be transformed. If all goes well, these tiny seedlings will soon be capable of surviving  and thriving  in the dryer, warmer climate that is sending chills through the spines of farmers across the globe. It's all thanks to a new technology called CRISPR, which allows for tiny, precise tweaks to DNA that were never possible before. These tweaks are already being used to make crops cheaper and more reliable. But their most important use may be in the developing world, where many of the plants that people rely on to avoid starvation are threatened by the impacts of climate change, including more pests and a lack of water. Cacao plants occupy a precarious position on the globe. They can only grow within a narrow strip of rainforested land roughly 20 degrees north and south of the equator, where temperature, rain, and humidity all stay relatively constant throughout the year. Over half of the world's chocolate now comes from just two countries in West Africa  Cte dIvoire and Ghana. But those areas won't be suitable for chocolate in the next few decades. By 2050, rising temperatures will push today's chocolate-growing regions more than 1,000 feet uphill into mountainous terrain  much of which is currently preserved for wildlife , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Mars, the $35 billion corporation best known for Snickers, is aware of these problems and others presented by climate change. In September, the company pledged $1 billion as part of an effort called ""Sustainability in a Generation,"" which aims to reduce the carbon footprint of its business and supply chain by more than 60% by 2050. ""We're trying to go all in here,"" Barry Parkin, Mars' chief sustainability officer, told Business Insider. ""There are obviously commitments the world is leaning into but, frankly, we don't think we're getting there fast enough collectively."" Its initiative with Cho at UC Berkeley is another arm of that efforts. If all goes as planned, they could develop cacao plants that dont wilt or rot at their current elevations, doing away with the need to relocate farms or find another approach. Jennifer Doudna, the UC Berkeley geneticist who invented CRISPR, is overseeing the collaboration with Mars. Although her tool has received more attention for its potential to eradicate human diseases and make so-called designer babies, Doudna thinks its most profound applications wont be on humans but rather on the food they eat. Courtney Verrill An avid tomato gardener, Doudna thinks her tool can benefit everyone from large food companies like Mars to individual hobbyists like herself. Personally, Id love a tomato plant with fruit that stayed on the vine longer, Doudna told Business Insider. The research lab she oversees at UC Berkeley is called the Innovative Genomics Institute. Many of the efforts by graduate students there focus on using CRISPR to benefit small-holder farmers in the developing world. One such project aims to protect cassava  a key crop that prevents millions of people from starving each year  from climate change by tweaking its DNA to produce less of a dangerous toxin that it makes in hotter temperatures. Doudna founded a company called Caribou Biosciences to put CRISPR into practice, and has also licensed the technology to agricultural company DuPont Pioneer for use in crops like corn and mushrooms. Regardless of which crop the public sees CRISPR successfully used in first, the technology will be a key tool in a growing arsenal of techniques we'll need if we plan to continue eating things like chocolate as the planet warms.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/chocolate-extinct-40-years/,Science,Snopes
7538,Tidalgate: Climate Alarmists Caught Faking Sea Level Rise,"Alarmist scientists have been caught red-handed tampering with raw data in order to exaggerate sea level rise. The raw (unadjusted) data from three Indian Ocean gauges  Aden, Karachi and Mumbai  showed that local sea level trends in the last 140 years had been very gently rising, neutral or negative (ie sea levels had fallen). But after the evidence had been adjusted by tidal records gatekeepers at the global databank Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) it suddenly showed a sharp and dramatic rise. The whistle was blown by two Australian scientists Dr. Albert Parker and Dr. Clifford Ollier in a paper for Earth Systems and Environment. The paper  Is the Sea Level Stable at Aden, Yemen?  examines the discrepancies between raw and adjusted sea level data in Aden, Karachi and Mumbai. The authors expose how PSMSL data-adjusters make it appear that stable sea levels can be rendered to look like they are nonetheless rising at an accelerated pace. The data-adjusters take misaligned and incomplete sea level data from tide gauges that show no sea level rise (or even a falling trend). Then, they subjectively and arbitrarily cobble them together, or realign them. In each case assessed, PSMSL data-adjusters lower the earlier misaligned rates and raise the more recent measurements. By doing so, they concoct a new linearly-rising trend. Here is a before/after from Karachi: The authors do not mince their words. They refer to these adjustments as highly questionable and suspicious. Thats because they can find no plausible scientific explanation for the adjustments. As they explain at the beginning of their paper, it is hard to put together consistent sea level records covering a long time period. This is because tide gauges are often the result of multiple sets of data, taken over different time periods using different instruments, which are then spliced together. 2017a What is proposed as a single record in databases such as the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) (PSMSL) is often the composition of data collected by different instruments, sometimes in different locations or over different time windows, with significant gaps in between one measurement and the others. This is the case of the Aden, Yemen tide gauge that is the only tidal location of the Arabian Peninsula spanning a time window long enough to infer a trend and acceleration of the relative sea level (assuming there was continuous measurement and no quality issue). In Aden, similar to Karachi and Mumbai and other tide gauges of the area, a single-tide gauge record is the result of multiple sets of data subjectively coupled together. While a new tide gauge is recording since about 2007, the alignment of the previous data is continuously changing. So there is nothing per se wrong with PSMSL making adjustments in order to make the different datasets align. What is wrong is the way that the scientists at PSMSL have adjusted them. In every case, they have revised them in order to make them produce a sharp upward trend in sea level rise  despite the fact that global records do not support this. The truth, Parker and Ollier conclude in their paper, is that sea level has changed very little in the three sites examined:",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/scientists-caught-tampering-raw-data-exaggerate-sea-level-rise/,Science,Snopes
7885,How Google and MSM Use Fact Checkers to Flood Us with Fake Claims |,"Guest essay by Leo Goldstein The Left implemented a novel technique of the Big Lie that I will call a Flooding Fake here. This technique was especially widely used by climate alarmism. This is what it looks like: An important figure or organization on the Left is caught doing something wrong, saying something outrageous, or blatantly lying. The Left injects into public discourse an absolutely fake, but believable, account of this action and immediately debunks this account. The fake narrative is accepted by the public as truth because the public knows that something similar has happened. The immediate debunking is rejected as a cover-up attempt. Later, when people accuse the original wrongdoer they use elements of the fake narrative. This is when fact checkers jump on them. Fake news networks accuse honest statesmen and commentators of spreading fake news. The liberals conviction that the conservatives are stupid and uninformed gets deeper. Google buries honest pieces far from public sight. Facebook tries to prevent their sharing. Leftist politicians cry that they lost elections because of fake news. An example is a global cooling scare of the 70s. In 1977, Time magazine published an issue under the following cover: See (1) and (2). That cover is a seriously inconvenient truth for climate alarmists and their media accessories. So, Time attempted to re-write a history. It published a forged version of its own cover, the left one on the following picture (the Time-2013-version-of-1977): and then easily debunked it as a photoshopped version of its April 2007 cover ( 3 ). As I will explain below, Time magazine knew it was launching a hoax. The rest of the liberal media popularized it, although it could have easily recognized it. Snopes adopted it ( 4 ), invented additional details that were not present in the Time article, and angrily condemned climate deniers. Quotes from Snopes: A rhetorical technique commonly employed by anthropogenic climate change deniers to diminish climate science is to reference fears some scientists had over the prospect of global cooling in the 1970s. One commonly shared pairing, floating around the internet since at least 2013, purports to show two covers of Time Magazine: A 1977 issue  As noted by Time itself in 2013, the 2006 image on the right is an authentic cover, but the 1977 image is a doctored version of an 9 April 2007 issue which actually featured an article titled The Global Warming Survival Guide I dont know when Snopes published that, because Snopes had its history erased from archive.org. Archive.org (that calls itself the Wayback Machine) is an Amazon-owned service that stores copies of web pages and sites for posterity. Some pages and sites are not stored because they are not popular, are forbidden to crawlers, or are hard to save. But Snopes.com has been excluded from the Wayback Machine. Snopes.com is the first website I encounter that has been excluded. That means it has forbidden archive.org to crawl its site and demanded to take down already saved data. That makes sense. Snopes is a fact checker  it checks facts to ensure they match the party line. In such cases, the party line is usually thin and changes frequently, so Snopes does not want 3rd parties to keep the history of changes. Think Orwell, 1984. But everyone who lived through the 70s knows that any climate worries at the time were about cooling, and many know that one 1977 Time issue reflected these worries. Some climate realists googled the cover of that issue, and what they found was a fabrication. Not aware of that, they fell into the trap and posted this fabricated picture as a proof. Even the website of Dr. Roy Spencer fell a victim. Then, climate alarmists had a joyful and profitable time debunking the forgery they and/or their accomplices had created. This trick has been repeated multiple times with other arguments, convincing the majority of onlookers that climate realists are liars or simply ignorant. Trace forward After Snopes finally established this Flooding Fake narrative, the fake-stream media have been giving it the megaphone. Google and, probably, Facebook use it to fact check news and ordinary search results. This is how this looks in Google: archive.org. Snopes is also known to be hyper-partisan, but so is Google, and it might be excused for taking their political alignment as an evidence of objectivity by Snopes. Google also knows that it is a search engine, and fact checking is none of its business. The first Google search result says that Donald Trump is behind the hoax, created by the Time magazine four years ago, and links to a fresh Time article ( 6 ), repeating and amplifying the hoax. A Wikipedia entry ( 7 ) is the second result, and Snopes comes third. Snopes result is fact-checked by Snopes itself. Thus, Google simply cons a user with its fact check. This is a recurrent occurrence, not an exception. Google knows that Snopes is untrustworthy from the fact that Snopes has expunged its history form. Snopes is also known to be hyper-partisan, but so is Google, and it might be excused for taking their political alignment as an evidence of objectivity by Snopes. Google also knows that it is a search engine, and fact checking is none of its business. Of course, this fact-checking by Google and some social media websites is nothing but a political censorship. Google is a monopoly created by the Obama administration through failure to enforce anti-trust laws, and then through subjecting the Internet use of 300 million citizens to the Title II regulation for the benefit of Google and other content providers. I dare to say that through Google, Facebook, and some other hand-picked corporate favorites, the Obama administration attempts to control our speech from the grave. Traceback I guess that climate alarmists launched this specific misinformation operation in response to the Global Cooling Compilation article, published by Anthony in March 2013. The WUWT article featured the correct 1977 Time cover. Time-2013-version-of-1977 picture in ScienceBlogs on June 4, 2013 (A few days ago a facebook friend of mine posted the following image. Two days later, Time magazine published its own piece, which has launched the forged Time-2013-version-of-1977 picture into mass circulation. The piece but gave a nod to Kirtley and ScienceBlogs.

Two days later, Time magazine published its own piece, which has launched the forgedpicture into mass circulation. The piece but gave a nod to Kirtley and ScienceBlogs. Time magazine claimed that the forged picture was found on a page of a linked page on a conservative site called UncommonDescent.com . I cannot say whether that picture was on that site at any time. But by the time the Time article was published, that page on UncommonDescent.com had not a picture, but this text: It turns out the Time magazine cover How to Survive the Coming Ice Age is a photoshopped fake. However, while the cover is a fake, Time was in fact printing stories about fears of global cooling in the 70s. See here. And so was Newsweek. See here. And the National Science Board. See here. And Science. See here. And several other sources summarized here. We regret the error of putting the fake Time cover up. However, the point we were trying to make remains valid. Time-2013-version-of-1977 forgery. It is easy to verify the page on UncommonDescent.com has been saved in archive.org on April 19, 2012: The post is still there and contains links. Its impossible to say from the text whether the photoshopped cover was the same as the one published later by Time. Most important: the post was dated by April 12, 2012  more than a year before Time magazine published itsforgery. It is easy to verify the page on UncommonDescent.com has been saved inon April 19, 2012: _LINKS_ The original source of the fake cover is hard to trace. It is almost certainly somebody in the climate alarmism camp: the real cover from 1977 was very clearly making a point against climate alarmism. But the point of entry of the forgery into mass circulation was Time magazine, June 6 of 2013. Good job, motherf*ckers. Conclusion 1 This is not an outlier, but a repeating pattern. The most damaging case is uncertainties in the predictions of complex climate models. Of course, real scientists, physicists and mathematicians, used to say that there were uncertainties in the predictions of climate models, but only out of politeness. They really meant that those models were bullsh*t. I could not believe such things would gain traction in a free society on such scale, and I still dont believe. It might be that the U.S. was not a free society in the second term of the Obama administration, and that the remnants of the Obama regime have been in #resistance since the unexpected defeat in the elections. Conclusion 2 In the next two days, a Google lawyer will speak to the Senate Intelligence Committee and will attempt to steer its attention to a non-existent Russian collusion. He or she will lie and present cherry-picked or outright fabricated evidence. If the government wants to know the truth about extent to which Google aided foreign powers to interfere in the US elections and politics, it should not listen to Google representatives, but to send FBI to physically enter Googles premises, to copy all of its code and data, and to start interrogating executives and sysadmins (after obtaining an appropriate court order, of course). Remarks In this example, multiple entities are involved: Google, Snopes, Time magazine, and ScienceBlogs. They are independent entities, but each of them knowingly plays its own well-defined role in the chain of injection, amplification, propagation, and utilization of a lie. Thus, they might be referred to as a single body. The Flooding Fake is different from a strawman fallacy. The Flooding Fake is a political operation, rather than a fallacy. Accordingly, in a strawman fallacy, the strawman is not disseminated outside of the original debate, and does not convince the opponent. The Flooding Fake is disseminated very broadly and eventually takes over some opponents. The Flooding Fake is related to two other PR techniques of the left: fake opponents (like fossil fuels interests), and fake debate subject. Another example of the Flooding Fake at work is the funny meme Al Gore  the inventor of the Internet. In fact, Al Gore pretended to be much more, almost a Creator of the Internet [link]. I did not check who was the first to utter that meme. It might have been a misspeaking analyst or politician on the right. But the first source does not matter because it is not broadly read or viewed, if at all. What matter is who injected the fake meme into the broad circulation.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/time-magazine-cover-global-cooling/,Science,Snopes
7946,Fatalities at wind turbines may threaten population viability of a migratory bat,"Large numbers of migratory bats are killed every year at wind energy facilities. However, population-level impacts are unknown as we lack basic demographic information about these species. We investigated whether fatalities at wind turbines could impact population viability of migratory bats, focusing on the hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus), the species most frequently killed by turbines in North America. Using expert elicitation and population projection models, we show that mortality from wind turbines may drastically reduce population size and increase the risk of extinction. For example, the hoary bat population could decline by as much as 90% in the next 50 years if the initial population size is near 2.5 million bats and annual population growth rate is similar to rates estimated for other bat species ( = 1.01). Our results suggest that wind energy development may pose a substantial threat to migratory bats in North America. If viable populations are to be sustained, conservation measures to reduce mortality from turbine collisions likely need to be initiated soon. Our findings inform policy decisions regarding preventing or mitigating impacts of energy infrastructure development on wildlife.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/400-papers-published-in-2017-prove-that-global-warming-is-myth/,Science,Snopes

8060,Small Asteroid Is Earth's Constant Companion,"A small asteroid has been discovered in an orbit around the sun that keeps it as a constant companion of Earth, and it will remain so for centuries to come. As it orbits the sun, this new asteroid, designated 2016 HO3, appears to circle around Earth as well. It is too distant to be considered a true satellite of our planet, but it is the best and most stable example to date of a near-Earth companion, or ""quasi-satellite."" ""Since 2016 HO3 loops around our planet, but never ventures very far away as we both go around the sun, we refer to it as a quasi-satellite of Earth,"" said Paul Chodas, manager of NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object (NEO) Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. ""One other asteroid -- 2003 YN107 -- followed a similar orbital pattern for a while over 10 years ago, but it has since departed our vicinity. This new asteroid is much more locked onto us. Our calculations indicate 2016 HO3 has been a stable quasi-satellite of Earth for almost a century, and it will continue to follow this pattern as Earth's companion for centuries to come."" In its yearly trek around the sun, asteroid 2016 HO3 spends about half of the time closer to the sun than Earth and passes ahead of our planet, and about half of the time farther away, causing it to fall behind. Its orbit is also tilted a little, causing it to bob up and then down once each year through Earth's orbital plane. In effect, this small asteroid is caught in a game of leap frog with Earth that will last for hundreds of years. The asteroid's orbit also undergoes a slow, back-and-forth twist over multiple decades. ""The asteroid's loops around Earth drift a little ahead or behind from year to year, but when they drift too far forward or backward, Earth's gravity is just strong enough to reverse the drift and hold onto the asteroid so that it never wanders farther away than about 100 times the distance of the moon,"" said Chodas. ""The same effect also prevents the asteroid from approaching much closer than about 38 times the distance of the moon. In effect, this small asteroid is caught in a little dance with Earth."" Asteroid 2016 HO3 was first spotted on April 27, 2016, by the Pan-STARRS 1 asteroid survey telescope on Haleakala, Hawaii, operated by the University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy and funded by NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office. The size of this object has not yet been firmly established, but it is likely larger than 120 feet (40 meters) and smaller than 300 feet (100 meters).

13997,Flushing out an equatorial fraud,"On Twitter recently, I saw the following tweet: Phil Plait Phil Plait writes Slates Bad Astronomy blog and is an astronomer, public speaker, science evangelizer, and author of Death From the Skies! Advertisement [That tweet was from Minute Physics, a great channel on YouTube which does very short, informative, and fun animated physics videos.] Intrigued, I clicked the link and watched this video. I describe it below. [You may have to refresh the page to get the video to load; if you see a blank spot beneath this then refresh.] Advertisement Amazing, right? Not really. It's totally bogus! And I'm happy to explain how. Advertisement Spinning the truth Here's the deal. The trick plays on the idea that people think water will drain (or flush in a toilet) one way north of the equator, and the other way south. Most people know hurricanes rotate one way (counterclockwise) in the north and the other (clockwise) in the south, so there's some basis for this. The reason cyclones spin opposite ways in opposite hemispheres is due to the Coriolis effect, which I've explained in detail both on this blog and on my old website. Read those explanations first if you'd like, but you don't need to understand the Coriolis effect in detail here. All you need to know is that over the size of a water basin, the Coriolis force has no effect. I mean it: none. Any random eddy or movement of water in the basin is hugely more important than the teeny tiny effect of the rotating Earth on the basin. Advertisement Brain drain So how does this work then? Watch the guy working the ruse carefully. First he goes through a show of finding north, and locating the position of the Equator. This is all simply for show. As you'll see in a second, this exact trick will work anywhere, not just on the Equator. I could do it in Boulder, at a latitude of 40 north! Advertisement He goes first to a basin on the Equator. It's already filled, and the video jumped right before that, so I don't know if he filled it right before draining it, or if it was sitting there for a while already filled. My guess is it had the water sitting for awhile -- you'll see why in a second. When he pulls out the plug the water drains straight down. OK. He then grabs the basin and bucket and moves a few meters south. Watch very carefully what happens then: he pours the water from a bucket, making sure the water is flowing in to the left of the drain hole: I've noted with an arrow where the plug is, and where he's pouring the bucket. When he does this, it sets up a natural clockwise spin to the water overall; it hits the back of the basin and will flow to the right from there. At least some of the people around him don't notice this, though, since you can hear them talking excitedly about it. Now watch again starting at 1:40 when he moves the basin to the north of the Equator. It's hard to see, but you do very certainly see him pouring the water to the right of the drain hole: See? That naturally sets up a counterclockwise rotation to the water! It has nothing to do with where the basin is; if he swapped the two locations but still poured to either side of the drain hole, the water would do exactly the same thing! As for the water in the basin on the Equator, that's why I think it was sitting for awhile first: he probably filled it carefully so there was no circular motion of the water. That way, when it drains, it drains straight down. Flushed away One thing I want to point out here: that guy knows exactly what he's doing. He has to, to make it work. So at the very least, this is a trick. If he's asking for money, though, and not explaining it, then in my opinion it's just plain old fraud. Of course it's not like he's the first guy to take advantage of tourists! Caveat emptor, of course. But then, caveat venditor, too. Because there are folks like me who are fond of lux et veritas*. My point is simply this: it's easy to fool people, and it's really easy to fool them if they already have some vague knowledge of how things are ""supposed"" to be. By coincidence, my friend James Randi wrote about this very topic for Wired magazine recently. It's worth a read. I'll note -- speaking of separating people from their money -- that I have a whole chapter in my book Bad Astronomy debunking exactly this type of thing, though the person in the example I used had a slightly different technique. But the bottom line is this: for hurricanes and shooting cannon and launching missiles, yeah, the Coriolis effect is important. For draining sinks and flushing toilets, though, it's all a matter of spin. Tip o' the cyclone to Minute Physics.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/coriolis-effect/,Science,Snopes
516,United States health care facilities face an intravenous bag shortage because of the devastation wreaked by Hurricane Maria in September 2017.,"SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO ��� When things went bad during Hurricane Maria, they went bad all at once, across this entire island. Suddenly, everything was dysfunctional, including the power grid, the cellphone towers, the banking system. Even the disaster managers, the professionals in charge of responding to hurricanes, were forced to evacuate the buildings where they had sheltered during the powerful storm.

They shifted operations to the convention center here, an improvised maneuver that was just one of the reasons the government struggled to meet the challenges Maria presented. They were in the dark. The island���s residents were in the dark. No one knew the extent of what had happened ��� or what was happening ��� for days.

���Everything collapsed,��� said H��ctor Pesquera, the Puerto Rico governor���s director of safety and public protection. ���Everything collapsed simultaneously.���

Nearly two weeks after Maria caused a historic catastrophe and thrust Puerto Rico into a humanitarian crisis, President Trump on Tuesday is scheduled to make his first visit to the island since the storm hit on Sept. 20.

Trump is expected to meet with Gov. Ricardo Rossell��, who has repeatedly expressed appreciation for federal support from Washington. It is unclear whether Trump will encounter San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul��n Cruz, who has sharply criticized the federal effort, saying that Puerto Ricans are dying while the nation���s bureaucracy stumbles.

Trump has tweeted attacks on Cruz���s leadership, and the president has repeatedly said that stories highlighting the slow response to the crisis are fake news.

Watch aerial views of damaged Guajataca dam in Puerto Rico

That view was echoed, if in a more subtle way, by the Federal Emergency Management Agency���s administrator on Monday after he flew to the island and, as he told reporters, saw signs of civic vibrancy in San Juan. William ���Brock��� Long said he managed to get a cellphone signal when he was 20 minutes outside the capital and heading to a remote area.

���As we were going down the road, I saw numerous fuel trucks with security, I saw numerous water trucks with security,��� he said. ���I saw a lot of resilient Puerto Ricans. I saw neighbors helping neighbors. I didn���t see anybody in a life-threatening situation at all.���

[Trapped in the mountains, Puerto Ricans don���t see help, or a way out]

The statutory requirements and protocols of disaster management are complex. The Defense Department has authority to send some of its assets where it sees fit, and in the case of Hurricane Maria did not initially deploy as many ships, sailors and soldiers as it could have. But the Defense Department is supposed to support, and follow the guidance of, FEMA. FEMA, in turn, is supposed to support the local and state (and in this case, territory) government.

Political sensitivities enter the calculation ��� with governors invariably wanting to show command and control ��� as was the case with Rossell��, who on Thursday took pains to say that the government of Puerto Rico is fully in charge of the Maria disaster response.

���The last thing a political leader wants to admit is that the problem is beyond their control,��� said retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, who played a critical role in the federal responses to Hurricane Katrina and the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. ���There has to be a frank, unvarnished conversation about the scope of the problem and how to deal with it. It is politically hard but operationally essential.���

Even before Maria, Puerto Rico had been hobbling along economically amid a financial crisis and at the same time convulsing politically. Now comes the longer-term question of whether the island can rebuild its economy and stave off wholesale flight of its residents to the mainland.

Rossell��, trying to steer attention toward the broader issues facing Puerto Rico, said on Sunday: ���I invite you to reflect on why Puerto Rico is in the current state of disadvantage and inequality. It���s not something that happened just a few months or few weeks before this storm. It is a condition that has happened for more than a century in Puerto Rico. .���.���. I invite you to reflect on the reality that even after the storm hit Puerto Rico, even when it was evident that it was a disaster in the United States, only half of our U.S. citizens knew that Puerto Ricans were U.S. citizens.���

Rosell�� and other officials have not denied that the government struggled to provide food, water, medicine and fuel in the wake of Maria, but they have pointed to the challenges of being an island 1,000 miles from the mainland, as well as the communication breakdowns they experienced.

The scale of the disaster became clear only when mayors from across the island arrived in San Juan on Sept. 23, three days after the storm, for a meeting at the convention center at which they delivered dire reports in person. The U.S. government did not ramp up all of its capabilities until six days had passed. Last Tuesday, the Pentagon dispatched an Army one-star general to the island and then quickly elevated that command by sending in a three-star general.

[���If anyone can hear us .���.���. help.��� Puerto Rico���s mayors describe widespread devastation from Hurricane Maria]

���Every day we get more and more situational awareness,��� said John Rabin, the acting administrator for the FEMA division that oversees Puerto Rico. ���As soon as we recognized there was a need for more resources and more capability, we ordered up that proverbial bigger boat.���

Asked if the response was slow, he went silent for a few beats.

���It���s not that it was ���slow���; it���s ���complex,��� is the way I would describe it,��� Rabin said.

He cited one example of the way the response is evolving: FEMA and the Puerto Rico emergency managers sent relief supplies to 11 locations around the island. But the lack of communication meant that many people were not showing up for the supplies. Officials since have been using military helicopters to carry aid to rural locations.

The difficulty in responding to Maria has revealed how unique each disaster is ��� and how resistant to a one-size-fits-all approach. Hurricane Harvey, for example, created a flooding disaster in Houston and other cities in southern Texas, and thousands of people had to be rescued from their homes, often by civilians using private boats.

For Maria, numerous Coast Guard and FEMA urban-search-and-rescue teams were on hand or arrived quickly. But it soon became clear that what people needed most were life-sustaining provisions ��� including water, food and diesel fuel for generators ��� that the search-and-rescue teams didn���t have.

Senior officials in the Pentagon debated sending additional assistance in the first few days after the storm, including deploying a 1,000-bed hospital ship, the USNS Comfort, under their own authority. They decided instead to fill requests from the Puerto Rico government to send a couple of 50-bed hospital units that could be set up on shore.

Long visited Puerto Rico last Monday, and afterward the Pentagon���s effort changed. The next day Long appeared at the White House and announced the deployment of the Comfort.

Several U.S. military officials with knowledge of Puerto Rico operations said afterward that they hadn���t known about the ship���s deployment. The Comfort was not yet ready to sail.

Military officials said they have filled every request they have received in a timely fashion. The Navy had two amphibious combat ships, the USS Kearsarge and the USS Oak Hill, already in the region in response to Hurricane Irma, and after maneuvering to avoid Maria they sailed to Puerto Rico with a complement of Marines and sailors aboard. The Coast Guard had at least nine ships off the Puerto Rico coast shortly after the storm.

The unpredictable path of the storm played a role in the decision to send some ships, notably the USS Iwo Jima and USS New York, to ports on the mainland rather than to Puerto Rico in advance of Maria, the officials said. When pressed, they acknowledged that the ships could have steered clear of the storm while at sea and responded to the storm sooner.

As of Monday, there were 10 Army helicopters, 17 Navy and Marine Corps helicopters, and 10 National Guard helicopters involved in the Maria response, with an additional 12 Army Black Hawk helicopters and four MV-22 Osprey arriving soon, the Pentagon said.

Angela Fritz, The Washington Post���s deputy weather editor, confirmed this phenomenon is real and may occur during extremely powerful hurricanes such as Irma. The storm is so powerful, it can essentially change the shape of the ocean, Fritz said.
���Basically, Hurricane Irma is so strong and its pressure is so low, it���s sucking water from its surroundings into the core of the storm,��� Fritz wrote.
���In the center of the storm, where there is extreme low pressure, water is drawn upward. Low pressure is basically a sucking mechanism ��� it sucks the air into it, and when it���s really low, it can change the shape of the surface of the ocean. As the storm draws water toward the center, it gets pulled away from the surroundings.���
Wayne Neely, a forecaster with the Bahamas��� Department of Meteorology, warned residents of Long Island and Exuma, where water had also reportedly receded from the beaches, to be careful as the ocean returned back to high levels.
���Care must be taken in this case because the water often returns with even greater fury,��� Neely said in a Facebook post explaining the phenomenon.

708,Can the FireChat App Send Messages Without an Internet Connection?,"FireChat makes use of a feature Apple introduced in the latest version of its iOS mobile software, iOS7, called multipeer connectivity. This feature allows phones to connect to one another directly using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi as an alternative to the Internet. If you���re using FireChat, its ���nearby��� chat room lets you exchange messages with other users within 100 feet without sending data via your cellular provider.

Micha Benoliel, CEO and cofounder of startup Open Garden, which made FireChat, says the app shows how smartphones can be set free from cellular networks. He hopes to enable many more Internet-optional apps with the upcoming release of software tools that will help developers build FireChat-style apps for iPhone, or for Android, Mac, and Windows devices. ���This approach is very interesting for multiplayer gaming and all kinds of communication apps,��� says Benoliel.

Anthony DiPasquale, a developer with consultancy Thoughtbot, says FireChat is the only app he���s aware of that���s been built to make use of multipeer connectivity, perhaps because the feature remains unfamiliar to most Apple developers. ���I hope more people start to use it soon,��� he says. ���It���s an awesome framework with a lot of potential. There is probably a great use for multipeer connectivity in every situation where there are people grouped together wanting to share some sort of information.��� DiPasquale has dabbled in using multipeer connectivity himself, creating an experimental app that streams music from one device to several others nearby.

The new feature of iOS7 currently only supports data moving directly from one device to another, and from one device to several others. However, Open Garden���s forthcoming software will extend the feature so that data can hop between two iPhones out of range of one another via intermediary devices. That approach, known as mesh networking, is at the heart of several existing projects to create disaster-proof or community-controlled communications networks (see ���Build Your Own Internet with Mobile Mesh Networking���).

Apps built to exploit such device-to-device schemes can offer security and privacy benefits over those that rely on the Internet. For example, messages sent using FireChat to nearby devices don���t pass through any systems operated by either Open Garden or a wireless carrier (although they are broadcast to all FireChat users nearby).

That means the content of a message and metadata could not be harvested from a central communications hub by an attacker or government agency. ���This method of communication is immune to firewalls like the ones installed in China and North Korea,��� says Mattt Thompson, a software engineer who writes the iOS and Mac development blog NSHipster. Recent revelations about large-scale surveillance of online services and the constant litany of data breaches make this a good time for apps that don���t rely on central servers, he says. ���As users become more mindful of the security and privacy implications of technologies they rely on, moving in the direction of local, ad-hoc networking makes a lot of sense.���

However, peer-to-peer and mesh networking apps also come with their own risks, since an eavesdropper could gain access to local traffic just by using a device within range.

Open Garden���s main product is an app that allows Android devices to share their Internet connections (see ���Could You Spare Some Internet Access?���). However, Benoliel says that won���t be coming to the iPhone anytime soon because the feature that FireChat relies on cannot be used to share data connectivity.

Peer-to-peer mobile communications and mesh networks could prove especially important in countries with minimal communications infrastructure. ���You can see Google spending billions on fiber and balloons, but this is not going to solve the problem of ubiquitous mobile connectivity,��� Benoliel says. He argues that the spread of cheap Android phones across the world will make mesh networking feasible. ���We need to create small Internets that can function on their own and [then] connect them to the big Internet.���",TRUE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/can-firechat-send-messages-without-internet/,Science,Snopes
783,Is a Wisconsin Company Offering to Microchip its Employees?,"A Wisconsin company is to become the first in the US to microchip employees.

Three Square Market is offering to implant the tiny radio-frequency identification (RFID) chip into workers' hands for free - and says everyone will soon be doing it.

The rice grain-sized $300 (��230) chip will allow them to open doors, log in to computers and even purchase food.

And so far, 50 employees have signed up for the chance to become half-human, half-walking credit card.

But far from being some sort of dystopian nightmare, Three Square Market's Patrick McMullan believes everyone will soon be wanting their own microchip.

What does it feel like? BBC reporter gets chipped
""The international market place is wide open and we believe that the future trajectory of total market share is going to be driven by whoever captures this arena first,"" Mr McMullan said.


The company, which provides self-service ""micro markets"" to businesses around the world, was inspired by the micro-chipping already taking place in Sweden, where so-called ""bio-hackers"" have been inserting the tiny devices into willing participants for at least three years.

Three Square Market are even working with a Swedish company, BioHax, to deliver the new technology, which they see as one day being simply another payment and identification method - only instead of a credit card or phone, there would be a microchip between your thumb and finger.

But how did employees react?
While a large proportion of the world might think twice before putting a tiny chip in their hand, it seems those at Three Square Market had no such worries.

Out of 85 employees at the company's head office, 50 have come forward, vice-president of international development Tony Danna told the BBC.

""The people that wanted it were like yes, no hesitation,"" he said.

Can they be tracked?
""That is going to be the inevitable reaction,"" Mr Danna acknowledged.

""But there is no GPS tracking ability to it. It is really the same thing as the chip that is in your credit card.""

How does it go in - and how do you get it out?
The entire point of the chip is convenience, Mr Danna explained.

Eventually, he hopes it will replace everything you might have in your wallet - from your key fob to your credit card and ID. For now, it is just aiming to make life easier for those using Three Square Market's facilities.

But the convenience also stretches to installing and removing the chip.

""It takes about two seconds to put it in and to take it out,"" he told the BBC. Putting it in is ""like getting a shot"" using a syringe, while taking it out it like removing a splinter.

""Easy in, easy out,"" Mr Danna said.

What if you get robbed?
Like everything in life, it could happen.

But, says Mr Danna, at least it is all in one place, making it easier to cancel all those cards.",TRUE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/three-square-market-microchip/,Science,Snopes
8245,Is Fentanyl-Laced Marijuana Use on the Rise?,"CINCINNATI, OH (WLWT) ��� Synthetic opiates like fentanyl have been found in marijuana, Hamilton County Coroner Dr. Lakshmi Sammarco confirmed to NBC affiliate WLWT-TV Monday.

Fentanyl, a drug 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine, has been linked to a surge of fatal overdoses across the county. It has been showing up in other drugs across the area.

���We have seen fentanyl mixed with cocaine, we have also seen fentanyl mixed with marijuana,��� Sammarco said during a joint press conference with Sen. Rob Portman.

Sammarco said that there have already been 297 deaths in Hamilton County this year caused by suspected opioid overdose, compared to 403 confirmed deaths in all of 2016.

She did not specify how many cases involved marijuana mixed with a synthetic opiate.

���Essentially, the message we���ve tried to get out there, is if you are using any form of street drugs, count on them having some form of synthetic opioid mixed in,��� Samarco said.

Samarco added that it is nearly impossible to tell which drugs are mixed with a synthetic opiate.

���We can���t tell you for sure until we test the blood of someone who has died or any of the drugs seized by law enforcement,��� she added.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/fentanyl-laced-marijuana-rise/,Science,Snopes
8455,A major Hepatitis A outbreak in San Diego has been pinned on undocumented immigrants there.,"Dean James AMERICA���S FREEDOM FIGHTERS���
The ultra liberal city of San Diego, California which incidentally is inundated with illegal aliens is facing a health crisis and authorities have declared PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY.
A public health emergency was declared Friday over an outbreak of ���hepatitis A��� that has been linked to at least 15 deaths and 400 hospitalizations.
The liver disease outbreak started last November, with the homeless population affected most. The emergency declaration will help the city access state funds and provide legal protection for new sanitation measures, the Union-Tribune reported.
Areas with high concentrations of homeless people will receive roughly 40 portable hand-washing stations to help combat the disease, which can spread through fecal matter when people fail to thoroughly clean their hands after using the restroom.
Crews also plan to use bleach-spiked water for high-pressure washing to remove ���all feces, blood, bodily fluids or contaminated surfaces,��� according to a sanitation plan outlined in a letter Thursday.
Other cities in the region can expect to see similar hand-washing and street-sanitizing efforts, said Dr. Wilma Wooten, the region���s public health officer, FOX News reported.
After previous vaccination and educational programs failed to significantly reduce the infection rate, and with death reports spiking in recent weeks, San Diego decided to mimic a campaign used in Los Angeles, which is home to tens of thousands of homeless, in an attempt to curb the outbreak.
���We know that L.A. has had no local cases of hepatitis A related to the strain that we���re seeing here in San Diego,��� Wooten said. ���If they���re doing it there and they haven���t had any cases, it could be beneficial here as well.���
The moves in San Diego follow finger-pointing between city and county officials, with both sides insisting they were doing the best they could under tough circumstances, the newspaper said.
���There is no precedent for this,��� Wooten said. ���We will definitely have a playbook for if we have something like this in the future. But this is the first time we have had something of this nature happen.���

These kind of problems are typical in liberal cities.
Build the wall.

0,Congress takes up controversy over 5G service near airports,"Lawmakers wondered aloud Thursday how a showdown between two federal agencies over the rollout of new high-speed wireless service reached crisis proportions last month, but they were short on answers to a dispute that raised concerns about interference with key equipment on planes.

Some flights have been canceled since Verizon and AT&T turned on their new networks last month, but predictions of widespread cancellations turned out to be wrong. The Federal Aviation Administration has cleared 90% of the nation���s airline fleet to land during poor visibility at airports near 5G cell towers.

Those approvals are being made each month, plane by plane, based on the model of radio altimeter that they use to measure their height above the ground. Some ���lower-performing��� planes are still restricted, and a permanent fix for the entire fleet is likely at least a year away, FAA Administrator Stephen Dickson said during a hearing of the House aviation subcommittee.

The CEOs of American Airlines and United Airlines have said they don���t expect any more disruptions. However, more than half of the planes operated by regional airlines remain restricted during bad weather, said Faye Malarkey Black, president of a trade group for the smaller carriers, some of which operate flights for American Eagle, United Express and Delta Connection.

Congress takes up controversy over 5G service near airports
Black said cancellations are still occurring, and more than one-fourth of flights at the three major airports in the New York City areas are operated by smaller planes that can���t land there during bad weather because of restrictions related to 5G.

Verizon and AT&T agreed to two delays before launching most of their planned new 5G service on Jan. 19 except near airports, where they agreed not to turn on new cell towers for the time being.

Dozens of flights were canceled because of 5G concerns after the services went live, but widespread cancellations were avoided.

The current, temporary fix came after the White House stepped to settle a lack of cooperation between the FAA and the Federal Communications Commission that threatened to create massive disruptions for airlines and passengers.

Rep. John Katko, R-N.Y., told Dickson that FAA���s last-minute directives about operating around 5G indicates ���that you really didn���t have a plan and didn���t understand the gravity of the situation ahead of time.���

Dickson said FAA couldn���t authorize low-visibility flights near the new signals until it got information from the telecom companies about the location, height and power of their 5G towers.

House Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., blamed the FCC, which approved plans by Verizon and AT&T to launch faster and more reliable 5G service using the C-Band part of the radio spectrum that is close to the range used by altimeters, which are critical for landing in poor visibility.

DeFazio said he and aviation interests raised concerns about possible interference for several years, but the FCC ignored them and auctioned off 5G spectrum without ensuring there would be no interference with aviation.

���Having a dropped call is way less serious than having a dropped airplane,��� he said.

The FCC has said it provided enough buffer between C-Band and radio altimeters to prevent interference.

FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel was invited to testify but had a conflict, according to an agency spokesman, who declined to describe the conflict. He said that Rosenworcel spoke separately on Wednesday with DeFazio and the chairman of the aviation subcommittee, Rep. Rick Larsen, D-Wash.

The FCC and the telecom companies say that 40 other countries have rolled out C-Band 5G service without any reports of radio interference with planes. Aviation groups say those countries have lower-power 5G signals or impose other restrictions on the service to prevent interference, a claim that is disputed by the telecom industry.",TRUE,https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-telecommunications-transportation-federal-aviation-administration-94a3f92cf9a6f8d17874427c9a6a9b4b,Science,AP
0,Tesla recall: ���Full Self-Driving��� software runs stop signs,"DETROIT (AP) ��� Tesla is recalling nearly 54,000 cars and SUVs because their ���Full Self-Driving��� software lets them roll through stop signs without coming to a complete halt.

Recall documents posted Tuesday by U.S. safety regulators say that Tesla will disable the feature with an over-the-internet software update. The ���rolling stop��� feature allows vehicles to go through intersections with all-way stop signs at up to 5.6 miles (9 kilometers) per hour.

The recall shows that Tesla programmed its vehicles to violate the law in most states, where police will ticket drivers for disregarding stop signs. The Governors Highway Safety Association, which represents state highway safety offices, said it is not aware of any state where a rolling stop is legal.

Tesla agreed to the recall after two meetings with officials from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, according to documents. Tesla said in documents that it knows of no crashes or injuries caused by feature.

The recall covers Model S sedans and X SUVs from 2016 through 2022, as well as 2017 to 2022 Model 3 sedans and 2020 through 2022 Model Y SUVs.

Selected Tesla drivers are ���beta testing��� the ���Full Self-Driving��� software on public roads. The company says the cars cannot drive themselves and drivers must be ready to take action at all times.

A firmware release to disable the rolling stops is expected to be sent out in early February.

Tesla, which disbanded its media relations department, did not comment Tuesday.

NHTSA says failing to stop for a sign can increase the risk of a crash. ���The Vehicle Safety Act prohibits manufacturers from selling vehicles with defects posing unreasonable risks to safety, including intentional design choices that are unsafe,��� the agency said. ���If the information shows that a safety risk may exist, NHTSA will act immediately.���

Tesla introduced the ���rolling stop��� feature in a software update that was sent out to the testing owners on Oct. 20, 2020. NHTSA met with Tesla on Jan. 10 and 19 this year to discuss how the software operates, the documents said. On Jan. 20, the company agreed to disable the rolling stops with the software update.

The ���rolling stop��� feature let the Teslas go through all-way stop signs as long as the owner enabled the function. The vehicles have to be traveling below 5.6 mph while approaching the intersection, and no ���relevant��� moving cars, pedestrians or bicyclists can be detected nearby. All roads leading to the intersection had to have speed limits of 30 mph or less, the documents said. The Teslas would then be allowed to go through the intersection at 0.1 mph to 5.6 mph without coming to a complete stop.

Philip Koopman, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, said 4-way stop signs are commonly placed to protect intersections for children when no crossing guard is present. He said Tesla���s ���machine learning��� system can mistakenly identify objects. ���What happens when FSD decides a child crossing the street is not ���relevant��� and fails to stop?��� he asked. ���This is an unsafe behavior and should never have been put in vehicles.���

Koopman said traveling through a stop sign at 5.6 mph is akin to treating it as a yield sign.

Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the governors safety association, said he���s not surprised that Tesla programmed vehicles to violate state laws. ���They keep pushing the bounds of safety to see what they can get away with, and they���ve really been pushing a lot,��� he said. ���Each time it���s just a little bit more egregious. It���s good to see NHTSA is pushing back.���

The automaker should make safety a priority ���not taking advantage of some of our worst behaviors on the road,��� Adkins said.

In November, NHTSA said it was looking into a complaint from a California Tesla driver that the ���Full Self-Driving��� software caused a crash. The driver complained to the agency that a Model Y went into the wrong lane and was hit by another vehicle. The SUV gave the driver an alert halfway through the turn, and the driver tried to turn the wheel to avoid other traffic, according to the complaint. But the car took control and ���forced itself into the incorrect lane,��� the driver reported. No one was hurt in the Nov. 3 crash.

In December, Tesla agreed to update its software to prevent video games from being played on center touch screens while its vehicles are moving.

NHTSA also is investigating why Teslas using the company���s less-sophisticated ���Autopilot��� driver-assist system have repeatedly crashed into emergency vehicles parked on roadways.

Last week Tesla said in its earnings release that ���Full Self-Driving��� software is now being tested by owners in nearly 60,000 vehicles in the U.S. It was only about 2,000 in the third quarter. The software, which costs $12,000, will accelerate Tesla���s profitability, the company said.

CEO Elon Musk said he���d be shocked if the software can���t drive more safely than humans this year. In 2019, Musk predicted a fleet of autonomous Tesla robotaxis on the roads by the end of 2020.

0,IBM partners with Canadian province of Quebec in quantum computing push,"MONTREAL, Feb 3 (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) is partnering with the Canadian province of Quebec to boost quantum computing in a collaboration that could help advance areas like battery development, a company official said on Thursday.

IBM is deploying the quantum computer known as IBM Quantum System One in Canada for the first time, which is expected to be available for use at its facility in Bromont, Quebec by early 2023, Anthony Annunziata, IBM's director of accelerated discovery, said in an interview.

The partnership with Quebec would integrate quantum computing with cloud technologies, high-performance computing and artificial intelligence (AI) to tackle broader challenges like the environment.

""Batteries are very tough to build and improve. We've been working on them for decades and progress is slow, incremental,"" he said.

""If we bring AI and quantum into the picture, that can start to change and we can actually start to understand what's happening at the heart of batteries and understand new materials and new processes to build much better ones.""

The United States and other nations are in a race to develop quantum technology, which could fuel advances in artificial intelligence, materials science and chemistry.

Quantum computers could operate millions of times faster than today's advanced supercomputers.

The technology is based on quantum bits, or qubits, that can be 'superposed' on each other, exponentially increasing the amount of information that can be processed.

0,EXCLUSIVE iPhone flaw exploited by second Israeli spy firm-sources,"WASHINGTON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - A flaw in Apple's software exploited by Israeli surveillance firm NSO Group to break into iPhones in 2021 was simultaneously abused by a competing company, according to five people familiar with the matter.

QuaDream, the sources said, is a smaller and lower profile Israeli firm that also develops smartphone hacking tools intended for government clients.

The two rival businesses gained the same ability last year to remotely break into iPhones, according to the five sources, meaning that both firms could compromise Apple phones without an owner needing to open a malicious link. That two firms employed the same sophisticated hacking technique ��� known as a ���zero-click��� ��� shows that phones are more vulnerable to powerful digital spying tools than the industry will admit, one expert said.

""People want to believe they're secure, and phone companies want you to believe they're secure. What we've learned is, they're not,"" said Dave Aitel, a partner at Cordyceps Systems, a cybersecurity firm.

Experts analyzing intrusions engineered by NSO Group and QuaDream since last year believe the two companies used very similar software exploits, known as ForcedEntry, to hijack iPhones.

An exploit is computer code designed to leverage a set of specific software vulnerabilities, giving a hacker unauthorized access to data.

The analysts believed NSO and QuaDream's exploits were similar because they leveraged many of the same vulnerabilities hidden deep inside Apple's instant messaging platform and used a comparable approach to plant malicious software on targeted devices, according to three of the sources.

Bill Marczak, a security researcher with digital watchdog Citizen Lab who has been studying both companies' hacking tools, told Reuters that QuaDream's zero-click capability seemed ""on par"" with NSO's.

Reuters made repeated attempts to reach QuaDream for comment, sending messages to executives and business partners. A Reuters journalist last week visited QuaDream���s office, in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan, but no one answered the door. Israeli lawyer Vibeke Dank, whose email was listed on QuaDream's corporate registration form, also did not return repeated messages.

An Apple spokesman declined to comment on QuaDream or say what if any action they planned to take with regard to the company.

ForcedEntry is viewed as ""one of the most technically sophisticated exploits"" ever captured by security researchers.

So similar were the two versions of ForcedEntry that when Apple fixed the underlying flaws in September 2021 it rendered both NSO and QuaDream���s spy software ineffective, according to two people familiar with the matter.

In a written statement, an NSO spokeswoman said the company ""did not cooperate"" with QuaDream but that ""the cyber intelligence industry continues to grow rapidly globally.""

Apple sued NSO Group over ForcedEntry in November, claiming that NSO had violated Apple's user terms and services agreement. The case is still in its early stages.

In its lawsuit, Apple said that it ""continuously and successfully fends off a variety of hacking attempts."" NSO has denied any wrongdoing.

Spyware companies have long argued they sell high-powered technology to help governments thwart national security threats. But human rights groups and journalists have repeatedly documented the use of spyware to attack civil society, undermine political opposition, and interfere with elections.

Apple notified thousands of ForcedEntry targets in November, making elected officials, journalists, and human rights workers around the world realize they had been placed under surveillance.

In Uganda, for example, NSO's ForcedEntry was used to spy on U.S. diplomats, Reuters reported.

In addition to the Apple lawsuit, Meta's WhatsApp is also litigating over the alleged abuse of its platform. In November, NSO was put on a trade blacklist by the U.S. Commerce Department over human rights concerns. read more

Unlike NSO, QuaDream has kept a lower profile despite serving some of the same government clients. The company has no website touting its business and employees have been told to keep any reference to their employer off social media, according to a person familiar with the company.

REIGN

QuaDream was founded in 2016 by Ilan Dabelstein, a former Israeli military official, and by two former NSO employees, Guy Geva and Nimrod Reznik, according to Israeli corporate records and two people familiar with the business. Reuters could not reach the three executives for comment.

Like NSO's Pegasus spyware, QuaDream's flagship product - called REIGN - could take control of a smartphone, scooping up instant messages from services such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal, as well as emails, photos, texts and contacts, according to two product brochures from 2019 and 2020 which were reviewed by Reuters.

REIGN's ���Premium Collection��� capabilities included the ""real time call recordings"", ""camera activation - front and back"" and ""microphone activation"", one brochure said.

Prices appeared to vary. One QuaDream system, which would have given customers the ability to launch 50 smartphone break-ins per year, was being offered for $2.2 million exclusive of maintenance costs, according to the 2019 brochure. Two people familiar with the software's sales said the price for REIGN was typically higher.

Over the years, QuaDream and NSO Group employed some of the same engineering talent, according to three people familiar with the matter. Two of those sources said the companies did not collaborate on their iPhone hacks, coming up with their own ways to take advantage of vulnerabilities.

Several of QuaDream's buyers have also overlapped with NSO's, four of the sources said, including Saudi Arabia and Mexico - both of whom have been accused of misusing spy software to target political opponents.

One of QuaDream's first clients was the Singaporean government, two of the sources said, and documentation reviewed by Reuters shows the company's surveillance technology was pitched to the Indonesian government as well. Reuters couldn't determine if Indonesia became a client.

0,Short-Staffed U.S. Hospitals Using Green Card Boom to Hire Foreign Nurses,"ith many U.S. hospitals experiencing a nursing shortage due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some are hoping to bring foreign nurses in to help after many green cards went unprocessed or unclaimed.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates more than 500,00 seasoned nurses will retire by the end of 2022. Additionally, the National Center for Biotechnology Information found that while nursing employment opportunities are expected to grow 15 percent by 2026, the aging population of baby boomers, burnout from those currently in health care, and the stress from the COVID-19 pandemic means hospitals are even more understaffed, leading to increased patient mortality.

However, with more than double the available green cards this year, recruiters hope to bring more nurses to hospitals to help mitigate the staffing shortage.

Amy L. Erlbacher-Anderson, an immigration attorney, told the Associated Press she is seeing a greater demand for foreign nurses now than she has in 18 years.

""We have double the number of visas we've had available for decades,"" she said. ""That is kind of temporarily creating a very open situation.""

In September, the U.S. State Department instructed embassies to prioritize visa applications for health care workers on a case-by-case basis. However, Greg Siskind, an immigration attorney, told the AP U.S. consulate offices are not required to issue visas simply because they are available and most green cards are awarded to professionals already in the U.S.

Faith Akinmade, a nurse from Nigeria, has been working as an ICU nurse in Kentucky, but her work visa is set to expire in March, meaning one more nurse could be leaving her understaffed hospital.

""At this point and time, I just feel like I have faith that at the end of March, something is going to show up to continue to work,"" Akinmade told the AP.

Additionally, while the American Association of Colleges of Nursing reported a six percent increase in enrollment, insufficient faculty to teach and COVID constraints limited the number of students accepted to study in the program.

Sinead Carbery, the president of a nursing recruiting firm, told the New York Times nearly 1,000 nurses are arriving in the U.S. each month, the highest she's seen in three decades. Additionally, since the start of the pandemic, she said the demand for international nurses rose somewhere between 300 percent and 400 percent.

However, hospitals seeing nursing shortages before the pandemic will still face them despite the potential increase of foreign nurses coming to the U.S.

Avant Healthcare Professionals, which recruits nurses from countries overseas to place them in the U.S. hospitals, used to see 800 nurse requests, but now have more than 4,000.

""And that's just us, a single organization,"" Lesley Hamilton-Powers, the president of Avant told KTVQ-TV. ""Hospitals all over the country are stretched and looking for alternatives to fill nursing vacancies.""

Billings Clinic, the largest hospital in Montana, is just one of the many U.S. hospitals experiencing a shortage and turning to alternative methods to fill in the gap. In addition to hiring as many as 200 traveling nurses and paying them up to $200 an hour, the hospital also hired nearly two dozen nurses from countries, including the Philippines, Thailand, Kenya, Ghana, and Nigeria.

0,Denmark Has Lifted All COVID Restrictions���Why Isn't America Ready to Follow?,"Denmark became the first country in the European Union to lift all of its COVID restrictions on Tuesday. The country used its high vaccination rate to justify the move despite COVID cases in the country reaching their highest level in the pandemic.

People in Denmark are no longer required to wear face masks in indoor spaces. COVID passes for bars and restaurants and the need to self-isolate after a positive test result have also been removed.

The decision has been made as officials in countries, including the U.S., reconsider their approach to controlling COVID in what is the third calendar year of the pandemic. It also comes in the light of data suggesting the Omicron variant is less severe than its predecessors, and as vaccines and treatments have become more widely available.

Ahead in COVID deaths, the U.S. is behind Denmark in terms of COVID vaccinations, with just 64 percent of the country's population currently fully vaccinated. In Denmark, 81 percent of the population is fully vaccinated.

Mark Jit, professor of vaccine epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) in the U.K., told Newsweek: ""Right now countries with high vaccine coverage are able to relax restrictions without causing the same death rates we saw in previous waves. In the USA, due to lower vaccine coverage, death rates are higher and are continuing to rise.""

Jit cautioned against the lifting of restrictions in general. He told Newsweek: ""We still need to be vigilant as vaccine protection may wane and new variants may emerge. A new BA.2 Omicron variant that is more transmissible is spreading rapidly across Europe, and could cause cases to spike again, with a rise in deaths likely to follow.""

The epidemiologist said that allowing infections to spread so that people will develop natural immunity may not protect them from future variants, pointing out that being infected with Delta did not protect people from Omicron.

Jit concluded: ""For many countries with high vaccine coverage, we are entering a new phase of the COVID pandemic. But what this phase will look like is still unclear.""

COVID restrictions in the U.S.
Rules on restrictions such as masks and vaccine passports vary across the U.S. Currently, many U.S. states still require individuals to wear masks while indoors, with some areas such as Miami-Dade County, Florida, requiring visitors to county facilities to wear masks regardless of vaccination status, and others such as Portland, Maine saying masks need not be worn with proof of vaccination.

As of January 3, Chicago required residents over the age of 5 to show proof they are fully vaccinated to enter restaurants, fitness centers, and entertainment venues where food or drinks are served if their stay will last longer than 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in Indiana, Governor Eric Holcomb has signed a bill that bans state or local governments from requiring vaccine passports.

Seema Lakdawala, a respiratory virus expert at the University of Pittsburgh, told The New York Times she was surprised more states did not have new mask mandates amid the rise of the more transmissible Omicron variant. She said: ""I'm not sure anywhere at the moment is in a place that there is sufficient decrease in cases, at least in the U.S., to warrant taking off mask mandates.""

Lakdawala said that while she was ""hopeful we've turned a corner,"" she wants to see weeks of a downward trend for the virus.",TRUE,https://www.newsweek.com/denmark-vaccination-rate-covid-restrictions-lifted-compared-us-1674953,Science,Newsweek
0,Chicago Schools' COVID Testing Taking Double the Promised Turnaround Time,"icole Granacki has spent weeks dedicating her time to encourage parents at her daughter's school to sign up for the COVID testing program provided by the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) district.

When her hard work finally appeared to pay off���with testing enrollment among pre-K students jumping from 35 percent to 70 percent in a month���the district's program failed to take advantage of her efforts, with stagnant testing rates and delayed results.

For many parents and families at Helen C. Peirce Elementary, the testing program offered by CPS has been critical to their children's COVID safety.

Parents like Granacki rely on weekly testing to ensure that her four-year-old, who is too young to be eligible for COVID vaccination, is healthy.

NEWSWEEK NEWSLETTER SIGN-UP >
But the delay in testing results has rendered CPS' program almost pointless now that quarantine guidelines have shifted again.

While CPS has promised to deliver digital access to test results within 24 to 72 hours, parents at Peirce Elementary have been waiting four to five days���and some up to seven days���for their results.

By the time they've received their child's results, the recommended five-day isolation period for unvaccinated kids���a CPS policy that went into effect this week���has already passed.

""This essentially means no quarantining for unvaccinated students like my pre-K child,"" Granacki told Newsweek. ""I've been at our school advocating everybody to sign up for the testing program and we have a lot of families enrolled in that program, more than at other schools.""

NEWSWEEK SUBSCRIPTION OFFERS >
""Now the families are asking me, 'Well, what's the point of even doing this?' because the results are so slow that we can't take action on it,"" she said.

Comparably, students in nearby District 65, which includes Evanston and Skokie, have reportedly received next-day or same-day results as part of their testing program, which is being run by SHIELD Illinois and the University of Illinois.

School administrators in Chicago have noted that the result delays may be because Thermo Fisher samples are mailed and processed in Atlanta, unlike the SHIELD program, which is being used by more than 1,700 school districts and universities in the state.

Not only are testing results being delayed at Chicago schools, but Thermo Fisher Scientific���the company conducting the tests in partnership with CPS���has also reportedly failed to send enough testers to adequately test all the students enrolled in the program.

During the last week of January, Thermo Fisher only tested 38 percent of the Peirce Elementary students who signed up for weekly testing.

""One thing that had changed after the [Chicago Teachers Union] work stoppage was that [the district] encouraged more people to enroll, but there's not actually more testing being done at our school because there are not enough [testers],"" Granacki said.

CPS has said that while they are aspiring to be able to test all the students enrolled in the program, it is not currently committed to doing so.

""It's really discouraging to see this amazing joint effort between our families and our school administration���we're all working together to get everybody signed up for testing to keep our kids safe���and then we didn't actually see an increase in the number of tests that were being given in their school,"" Granacki said. ""Families have been disappointed each week when their kids are untested.""

The district's failure to provide enough testing resources to schools has forced some parents, like Granacki, to make difficult decisions.

For most of January, when the Omicron wave was sweeping through much of the country, she decided to keep her daughter at home even though the four-year-old wanted to be in person because Granacki didn't feel safe sending her child to school while positivity rates were still high.

""Families have been disappointed each week when their kids are untested,"" Chicago Public Schools parent Nicole Granacki told Newsweek. Students walk to A. N. Pritzker elementary school on January 12 in Chicago, Illinois.

Granacki hopes that by using COVID relief funds, CPS will be able to provide quicker test results and more resources to ensure that everyone enrolled in the weekly testing program can get a test.

In an ideal world, she said she wishes the district would adopt an opt-out program���an idea Mayor Lori Lightfoot has adamantly opposed.

Lightfoot has called it morally wrong for schools to be performing a ""quasi-medical procedure"" without parental consent.

""As a parent of a child, I would be outraged if a school system was doing anything with my child that I didn't know about, and I didn't affirmatively authorize,"" the mayor said earlier this month. ""Why would we take that option away from parents? We're not going to do that. Come up with a different plan.""

But Granacki said that most of the parents she's spoken to are not against expanded testing. She said the real reason many families haven't opted-in yet is that the district has made it difficult for parents to access enrollment forms.",TRUE,https://www.newsweek.com/chicago-schools-covid-testing-taking-double-promised-turnaround-time-1675867,Science,Newsweek
0,Ecologists Discover 400 Species Of Charles Darwin Living In Gal��pagos Islands,"PUERTO BAQUERIZO MORENO, ECUADOR���Describing an astounding variety of naturalists previously unknown to science, a team of ecologists from Stanford University announced Friday the discovery of more than 400 species of Charles Darwin living in the Gal��pagos Islands.

The Darwins, which researchers said have evolved to fill a staggering array of ecological niches throughout the archipelago, appear to have developed dramatically varied biological structures through the process of speciation, exhibiting beard lengths, for example, that range from closely cropped in some species to past the knee in others. Members of the Stanford team said they could tell which island a Darwin was from simply by studying the shape and thickness of its mutton chops.

���Our analysis of the fossil record suggests all the Darwins likely descended from a single ancestor that arrived from the mainland approximately two centuries ago.���
���The breathtaking diversity of Charles Darwin we see in the Gal��pagos is the result of each species having adapted to survive in different environments,��� said head researcher Dr. Robert Colletti, citing the example of a cold-blooded, 6-inch-long scaly Darwin that can fit into small holes on the sides of volcanic cliffs. ���We see Darwins of every conceivable sort, like an avian Darwin with a sophisticated vocal mechanism that allows it to mimic observations about natural history, or a bright pink, feathered Darwin that stands on long legs in shallow water and gets its color from the massive quantity of brine shrimp it consumes.���

���Our analysis of the fossil record suggests all the Darwins likely descended from a single ancestor that arrived from the mainland approximately two centuries ago,��� Colletti added. ���It���s absolutely remarkable.���

The ecologists explained that the proliferation of Charles Darwin in the Gal��pagos began with a now-extinct mammalian species, which at one time roamed the islands foraging for specimens of flora and fauna it could collect, place into categories according to their physical characteristics, and then carefully label before sending off to Cambridge University for expert analysis by contemporary naturalists.

As time passed, many highly adaptive traits appear to have emerged in its descendants, such as the thin, nimble talons that allowed one species of Darwin to examine the physiology of earthworms and determine its effects upon the soil before going on to write a popular book on the subject. Another remarkable adaptation can reportedly be observed in the still-extant citron-crowned Darwin, which displays its brilliantly colored bald spot during its courtship dance to woo sexual partners with its presumed virility.

According to Colletti and his team, most Charles Darwins are now vanishingly rare, as are many of the species that depend upon them, including a critically endangered orchid that can only be pollinated by one uniquely adapted Darwin with a 12-inch-long proboscis.

���We must act quickly if we wish to save the Darwins,��� said Colletti, expressing concern about the potential overfishing of aquatic Darwins, which he worried would be traded as exotic pets or sold as meat. ���Throughout the Gal��pagos, invasive species represent a real threat: Darwins are unable to compete for scarce water with large land mammals such as cattle and donkeys. And even the fittest Darwins, unfortunately, are unable fend off attacks from the feral pigs that now roam the islands.���

Though scientists cannot be certain what caused the sudden explosion of divergent Darwin species 200 years ago, they have noted that newly unearthed journals of the British naturalist Charles Darwin describe in detail the many nights he spent alone in the Gal��pagos longing for the intimate embrace of another.",FALSE,https://www.theonion.com/ecologists-discover-400-species-of-charles-darwin-livin-1830382825,Science,Onion
0,Facebook Announces Plan To Combat Fake News Stories By Making Them Actually Happen,"MENLO PARK, CA���Responding to widespread criticism over the hoaxes and political disinformation featured on its platform, Facebook announced at a press conference Friday a new initiative to combat fake news by making the inaccurate stories on the social media site actually happen.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who told reporters it was vitally important that Facebook address the false information it distributes and regain the trust of users by bringing every single untrue story to life, said the company has already hired 100,000 new employees to carry out widespread government conspiracies and other erroneously reported activities until all purported news on the site was accurate.

���We take this problem very seriously, and I want our users to be confident that the stories they see on Facebook are either true already or will be very soon,��� said Zuckerberg, who explained that the company has budgeted $45 billion toward ensuring that anytime news on the site was determined to be fake, vast resources would be available to make that news real. ���For example, if you read about high-level Democrats running a child sex ring out of the basement of a D.C.-area pizzeria, we will go to that restaurant, dig a basement if there isn���t one already, and get that human-trafficking operation up and running. That���s how dedicated we are to factual accuracy at Facebook.���

���In fact, we recently stopped a major fake story when we forced thousands of Muslim families to establish sharia law in Dallas and then blackmailed the entire police department until they agreed to treat a local neighborhood as a no-go zone,��� Zuckerberg added.

In addition to employing a new, state-of-the-art algorithm to help sort out stories that are currently true from those that need to become true, officials said the company would introduce a new feature that allows users to flag articles that are not yet real. According to sources, stories would then be sent to Facebook���s fact-checking partners, including InfoWars, YourNewsWire.com, and the Daily Stormer, for further review.

The social media company has also completed construction on a 3-million-square-foot command center in Silicon Valley, from which it will deploy tens of thousands of employees to points across the globe in order to carry out in real life the events depicted in fake stories, whether that means setting up Obamacare death panels, hiring immigrants to go out and commit crimes in disproportionately high numbers, convincing Melania Trump to employ a body double, or working around the clock to develop a vaccine that will finally cause autism in children.

���If an article on Facebook states that President Trump���s agenda is being undermined due to a deep-state conspiracy headed by Ellen DeGeneres, it is our public responsibility to infiltrate the federal government with thousands of highly trained agents, recruit Ms. DeGeneres as an asset, and make that a reality,��� said Zuckerberg, who also outlined a plan to purchase a massive fleet of jets that will spray trails of chemicals across the sky in order to psychologically manipulate the world���s populace. ���As a precautionary measure, we���ve already begun sending paychecks to anyone who protests at an event where Trump is speaking, just in case another story on Facebook accuses them of having been paid for their efforts.���

���Similarly, in response to fabricated accounts on Facebook of how the government is attempting to destroy Second Amendment rights, we staged a ���school shooting��� in which no one actually died and child actors were used to portray the supposedly dead victims,��� Zuckerberg continued.

Executives at Facebook confirmed their efforts go beyond fighting politically motivated stories, saying that after an article about a sleeping morgue employee being mistaken for a dead body and cremated was flagged as false, they saw to it the individual in question was burned alive. In response to a story spread on the site about a banana in an Oklahoma Walmart testing positive for HIV, Facebook hired a team of scientists to genetically engineer fruit capable of contracting the disease and had it placed in the store���s produce department.

Because fake celebrity death stories are among the most widespread of hoaxes perpetuated on Facebook, the company has reportedly corrected those mistakes by ordering its in-house team of assassins to kill Kirk Douglas, Bob Barker, Robert Redford, Carlos Santana, Paul McCartney, Jackie Chan, Mark McGrath, and others.

Early feedback from Facebook users on the plan to make fake news real has been largely positive.

���It���s great to know that when I see a story about Malia Obama getting arrested for drug possession, Facebook will, one way or another, make sure that is indeed what happens,��� said 33-year-old Greenville, NC resident Keith Wade. ���I hate it when I get told things like, ���Delta Airlines is offering free tickets if you take a short survey,��� and then find out later it���s not true.

0,NASA���s Mars Roomba Begins Mission To Clean Dust From Planet���s Surface,"PASADENA, CA���As part of ongoing preparations for a manned mission to the Red Planet, scientists at NASA���s Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced Wednesday that its autonomous Mars Roomba vehicle had landed safely and commenced the task of cleaning dust from the planet���s surface.

A NASA spokesperson confirmed that the circular, 1,900-pound, self-navigating vacuum had survived the 8-month journey from Earth with all vital sweeping and suction systems intact and had already begun removing iron oxide particles and small debris from the approximately 55.9 million square miles of Martian terrain.

���At this rate, we project that the entire planet will be spick and span by the time the first astronauts arrive.���

���We���re pleased to say that after years of planning, the Mars Roomba is finally hard at work cleaning some of the dustiest parts of the Red Planet,��� said senior engineer James Wurzburg, describing the jubilant scene at mission control after the Roomba successfully touched down and immediately started vacuuming loose pebbles and dust kicked up by its retrorockets during descent. ���Everything from the bristle brushes to the satellite mapping software is currently functioning as designed. In fact, the Roomba has already made significant progress in tidying up the Schiaparelli Crater.���

���At this rate, we project that the entire planet will be spick and span by the time the first astronauts arrive,��� added Wurzburg.

According to NASA officials, the Mars Roomba uses a number of advanced features to navigate and clean up around its environment, including independently spinning tracks of all-terrain wheels that allow it to turn a full 360 degrees while traveling at a maximum speed of 1.3 kilometers per hour, and an array of proximity sensors that can discern steep slopes and prevent it from accidentally plunging into a canyon. Additionally, NASA personnel confirmed the autonomous cleaning vehicle includes a contact-detecting front bumper that signals it to change directions whenever it encounters a large boulder or other obstacle.

For power, mission engineers confirmed that the Mars Roomba employs a portable nuclear reactor that provides up to three sols worth of cleaning time before the vehicle is forced to return to its self-charging station.

Prior to the Roomba���s launch, researchers reportedly spent six years testing various prototypes in a particularly dusty and desolate stretch of the Nevada desert, ultimately settling on a lightweight design that could remove all dirt down to the bedrock.

���If we���re ever going to establish a long-term colony, it���s crucial that the planet is tidy,��� said project director Kaitlyn Mendoza, highlighting the potential danger of future astronauts tracking muck all over the place. ���The first Mars cleaning rover we sent in 1997, Sterility, had a pair of radio-controlled mop and bucket arms, but those just resulted in getting the Cydonia region all muddy. It���s a unique set of challenges compared to, say, the moon, where we could just have Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin clean the whole lunar surface with push brooms.���

���But fortunately everything is going to plan with the Roomba, minus a brief period where it kept bumping into the Olympus Mons over and over,��� Mendoza continued.

0,Nvidia gives upbeat revenue forecast; Applied Materials sees supply-chain challenges,"Feb 16 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) on Wednesday forecast current-quarter revenue above analysts' estimates, banking on the strong demand for data centers.

Nvidia expects first-quarter revenue of about $8.1 billion, compared with analysts' estimates of $7.29 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

���We are seeing exceptional demand for NVIDIA computing platforms,��� Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in a statement. Data center revenue grew 71% to $3.26 billion in the fourth quarter.

Despite the strong results, Nvidia shares were down 2.5% in after-hours trading, and KinNgai Chan, analyst at Summit Insights Group, said the company's sales to the crypto industry could be a concern.

""A meaningful part of its gaming sales do include crypto-mining which we think could be volatile. Our most recent industry check does indicate a significant weakness in crypto-mining demand,"" said Chan.

Chan also said he was disappointed that Nvidia's gross margin did not rise in the fourth quarter from the third, despite the datacenter business outgrowing other units.

The company said it sold $550 million in crypto-specific cards in fiscal 2022, and only $24 million in the fourth quarter. Fourth-quarter gaming revenue was a record $3.42 billion, up 37% from a year ago.

With tech firms venturing into the ""metaverse"" and a spike in demand for data centers, revenue is surging for Nvidia, the world's largest maker of graphic and artificial intelligence chips, and for other chip makers.

Nvidia reported fourth-quarter revenue of $7.64 billion, a record, compared with estimates of $7.42 billion.

Nvidia's net income rose to about $3 billion in the fourth quarter from $2.46 billion a year earlier.

The results come on the heels of SoftBank Group Corp's (9984.T) collapsed deal to sell chip designer Arm to Nvidia. Worth up to $50 billion at current market prices, it would have been the largest-ever chip deal.

Meanwhile, supplier to chip makers Applied Materials Inc (AMAT.O) also posted record quarterly revenue on Wednesday, driven by robust demand for its semiconductor-making equipment from customers including Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company . read more

However, Applied Materials' chief executive, Gary Dickerson, said the supply environment remains challenging and that the company is doing everything it can to deliver for customers. The company expected second-quarter revenue of $6.35 billion, marginally below analysts' estimates, according to Refinitiv data.

""Since we are already close to being sold out for the year, we also have a positive growth outlook for 2023,"" Dickerson told analysts on a conference call, adding that demand is very strong and spending on wafer fabrication equipment could reach $100 billion in 2022.

The space rock, called 2022 BH7, will pass our planet on Friday whilst traveling at a speed of more than 50,000 miles per hour.

It will reach its closest distance to Earth at around 4:45 p.m. ET that day, when it will be around 1.4 million miles away���roughly six times as far away as the moon is.

As such, Earth will be perfectly safe during 2022 BH7's pass. However, the asteroid is still classed as a potentially hazardous asteroid (PHA) by NASA's Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS).

Asteroids are given this classification based on their size and their potential to make threatening close passes by our planet, though an asteroid can still be a PHA even if it's not expected to hit Earth.

2022 BH7 meets this criteria, with its size estimated to be between 557 feet and 1,246 feet across, CNEOS data shows. This means that, at the upper limit, the asteroid could be nearly as wide as the Empire State Building is tall.

Again, Earth is expected to be perfectly safe when 2022 BH7 flies past. In fact, it's common for many asteroids to come much, much closer. CNEOS data shows that the asteroid 2022 CO6 is due to fly past Earth on Tuesday and will come within just over half the distance between Earth and the moon.

NEWSWEEK SUBSCRIPTION OFFERS >
2022 CO6 is still not expected to hit us, and in any case it is much smaller than 2022 BH7 with an estimated maximum diameter of around 144 feet.

While asteroid impacts may sound like the domain of Hollywood films, scientists take the threat they pose seriously. According to CNEOS, rocky or iron asteroids larger than about 100 meters (328 feet) across would be expected to reach Earth's surface once every 10,000 years or so on average. These would be large enough to cause local disasters, including tidal waves.

Once every several hundred thousand years or so, asteroids larger than a kilometer (0.62 miles) across would be expected to collide with our planet, which would pose a threat to life on Earth.

A couple of notable asteroid impacts have occurred in recent history���both of them in Russia. One was the 1908 Tunguska event, thought to have been caused by a space rock with varying size estimates up to 300 feet in diameter.

It hit near the Podkamennaya Tunguska River in central Siberia, producing an explosive force of as much as 15 megatons of TNT, which is 1,000 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, on August 6, 1945, according to Britannica. A NASA estimate puts the explosive force lower, equivalent to 185 times that of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.

Then there was the Chelyabinsk asteroid which exploded around 14 miles above the Russian city of Chelyabinsk in 2013.

Among the attackers��� targets was the hosting provider for Ukraine���s army and Privatbank, said Doug Madory, director of internet analysis at the network management firm Kentik Inc.

���There is no threat to depositors��� funds,��� Zhora���s agency, the Ukrainian Information Ministry���s Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security, said in a statement. Nor did the attack affect the communications of Ukraine���s military forces, said Zhora.

It was too early to say who was behind the attack, he added.

The ministry statement suggested Russian involvement: ���It is possible that the aggressor resorted to tactics of petty mischief, because his aggressive plans aren���t working overall,��� the Ukrainian statement said.

Quick attribution in cyberattacks is typically difficult, as aggressors often try to hide their tracks.

���We need to analyze logs from IT providers,��� Zhora said

Oleh Derevianko, a leading private-sector expert and founder of the ISSP cybersecurity firm, said Ukrainians are always worried that such ���noisy��� cyberattacks could be masking something more sinister.

Escalating fears about a Russian invasion of Ukraine eased slightly as Russia sent signals Tuesday that it might be pulling back from the brink, but Western powers demanded proof.

The cyber aggression is nevertheless typical of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who likes to try to keep his adversaries off balance.

���These attacks are ratcheting up attention and pressure,��� said Christian Sorensen, the CEO of the cybersecurity firm SightGain who previously worked for U.S. Cyber Command. ���The purpose at this stage is to increase leverage in negotiations.���

Ukraine has been subject to a steady diet of Russian aggression in cyberspace since 2014, when Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula and backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.

On Jan. 14, a cyberattack that damaged servers at Ukraine���s State Emergency Service and at the Motor Transport Insurance Bureau with a malicious ���wiper��� cloaked as ransomware. The damage proved minimal ��� some cybersecurity experts think that was by design, given the capabilities of Russian state-backed hackers. A message posted simultaneously on dozens of defaced Ukrainian government websites said: ���Be afraid and expect the worst.���

Serhii Demediuk, the No. 2 official at Ukraine���s National Security and Defense Council, called the Jan. 14 attack ���part of a full-scale Russian operation directed at destabilizing the situation in Ukraine, aimed at exploding our Euro-Atlantic integration and seizing power.���

Such attacks are apt to continue as Putin tries to ���degrade��� and ���delegitimize��� trust in Ukrainian institutions, the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said in a subsequent blog post.

In the winters of 2015 and 2016, attacks on Ukraine���s power grid attributed to Russia���s GRU military intelligence agency temporarily knocked out power.

Russia���s GRU has also been blamed for perhaps the most devastating cyberattack ever.

0,EXPLAINER: Will burglar alarms still work after 3G shutdown?,"NEW YORK (AP) ��� As telecom companies rev up the newest generation of mobile service, called 5G, they���re shutting down old networks ��� a costly, years-in-the-works process that���s now prompting calls for a delay because many products out there still rely on the old standard, 3G.

AT&T is scheduled to be the first carrier to shut down its 3G network on Feb. 22. T-Mobile will shut down its 3G network by summer and Verizon in December.

The home-alarm industry has asked the Federal Communications Commission, the U.S. regulator, to delay AT&T���s network sunset until December. The FCC is monitoring the 3G phase-out and working to ���implement safeguards��� for older phones and other devices, spokesperson Paloma Perez said late Monday.

Verizon has already pushed back its shutdown ��� twice ��� from an original target date in 2019, saying customers needed more time to update their devices. T-Mobile has also delayed the shutdown of the Sprint 3G network it acquired in 2020, to the end of March; it���ll shut down the T-Mobile 3G network by July 1.

EXPLAINER: Will burglar alarms still work after 3G shutdown?
WHY IS 3G SHUTTING DOWN?

First, some history. AT&T���s 3G network launched in the U.S. in 2004; later that decade it was the exclusive carrier for early iPhones, helping usher in the first phase of the smartphone era. The networks we currently rely on for video streaming, social apps, Uber and other must-haves of the modern era mostly use the subsequent 4G standard.

For the carriers, shutting down 3G is an efficiency move. As they upgrade to the latest technology, they shut off outdated networks and use the freed-up bandwidth for newer ��� and what they hope will be more profitable ��� services.

WHAT IF I HAVE AN OLDER PHONE?

People with older phones that aren���t compatible with 4G will have to upgrade; once 3G shuts down, those phones won���t work for calls or texting. AT&T says it has reached out to offer its customers free replacements via letters, emails and texts. Spokesperson Jim Greer said fewer than 1% of AT&T���s consumer devices, including phones, tablets and watches, will lose cellular service, but declined to say how many devices that is. The company reported about 196 million phones and connected devices using its network in the most recent quarter.

WHAT ABOUT OTHER DEVICES?

Industry groups have also raised concerns about other products that will need to be replaced or updated ��� everything from home fire alarms to ankle bracelets used by law enforcement. It���s not certain how many outdated products are out there, or how big a deal it would be if updates take place after Feb. 22.

The alarm industry and other companies say they have had issues replacing devices even though they���ve known about the coming shutdown for years. Recent setbacks include both pandemic-triggered supply-chain issues and customers hesitant to let technicians into their homes during the pandemic.

HOW MANY OUTDATED PRODUCTS ARE OUT THERE?

It���s not really clear. An alarm-industry lobbying group estimates that 1.5 million customers still need to upgrade their fire or burglar alarms, while about half a million have medical alert devices that run on 3G; it said most rely on AT&T service. While an unnetworked fire alarm will still sound an alarm if there���s smoke, it won���t be able to contact the fire department. Likewise, burglar alarms won���t route to emergency responders if triggered. Not all providers say there���s an issue. ADT said in November that it was on track to update its AT&T customers by February; a spokesperson declined to offer an update on Sunday.

AARP, the advocacy group for adults over 50, is also concerned that users of medical alert systems ��� those necklaces and bracelets, like Life Alert ��� that connect users to emergency call centers won���t know their gadgets don���t work anymore or won���t be able to replace them in time.

HOW SHOULD I PREPARE?

Check your phone to make sure it will still work. Here���s an AT&T list of devices that the carrier says will work normally after Feb. 22. Call the companies that make or service your burglar and fire alarms and personal medical alert systems to see if any need an update. If so, schedule a service visit immediately or get a new device shipped.

OK, DONE. ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD WORRY ABOUT?

A few. One manufacturer of ankle bracelets for people on probation, parole or pre-trial release said it hasn���t been able to update many 3G-reliant devices. A premature shutdown could potentially allow tens of thousands of offenders like child abusers, sex offenders and drunk drivers to go unmonitored while out of prison, Alcohol Monitoring Systems wrote in an August FCC filing. The company did not respond to questions.

Zonar, which provides GPS and other services for buses and trucks, says tens of thousands of vehicles will be affected. Trucks that aren���t upgraded may have to be idled if drivers can���t electronically log their hours as federal rules require. Zonar has a workaround for the trucking industry, but not all customers have placed orders for it, said Susan Corscadden, a company marketing executive.

Affected school districts could also lose their ability to track the location of school buses, while their drivers may not be able to use GPS systems for directions. The National Association for Pupil Transportation seconded these concerns in a September filing, although Noelle Ellerson Ng, the group���s legislative liaison, said in an interview that she hasn���t heard school superintendents raise the issue.

SO DOES THE SHUTDOWN POSE A SERIOUS PUBLIC-SAFETY THREAT?

It���s unclear. ���There���s a lot of uncertainty about the impact and about how many people are affected,��� said Tom Kamber, the executive director of Older Adults Technology Services, a nonprofit affiliated with AARP. The AARP has asked the FCC to delay the AT&T shutdown until December.

Public Knowledge, a public-interest group, also urged the FCC to block the February shutdown unless AT&T can show that it has made sure that essential services won���t be disrupted or that it can restore service immediately if problems arise.

SO WHY NOT DELAY?

AT&T says that delaying the shutdown would hurt its 5G rollout, degrading its customers��� ability to use their service and causing more dropped calls. The company argues that the alarm companies have had years to upgrade their customers��� devices. The company also says the FCC doesn���t have the authority to stop its shutdown.",TRUE,https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-federal-communications-commission-967e798ec0bb8074f1815b06cf01a0c1,Science,AP
0,GM to restart Chevy Bolt factory after battery fire recalls,"DETROIT (AP) ��� General Motors says it will start making Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles again in early April after an eight-month pause due to a series of battery fire recalls.

The automaker says Tuesday that battery supplier LG Energy Solution is now making enough to supply replacement modules for the recalls as well as to resume production.

The company will start making hatchback and SUV versions of the Bolt on April 4 at a factory north of Detroit. Those should start reaching dealers a few weeks later. Vehicles on dealer lots at the time of the recalls can be sold once battery modules are replaced.

In August GM expanded a previous recall to more than 140,000 Bolts sold worldwide since 2016 because battery manufacturing defects could cause the vehicles to catch fire.

The company said at the time that in rare cases, batteries that have two manufacturing defects can cause fires even when parked.

The recall follows reports of 13 battery fires, GM said, which can occur when both defects are present in the battery modules.

In October LG agreed to reimburse GM $2 billion for the recall costs, and the company remains in a joint venture with the company to build batteries for its next generation of electric vehicles.

The battery fires and recalls have been an embarrassing setback for GM, which has lofty goals of switching from internal combustion to battery powered vehicles. GM sold just under 25,000 Bolts in the U.S. before telling dealers to stop selling them due to the recall in August.

To capture U.S. electric vehicle market share leadership, GM plans to spend $35 billion to roll out more than 30 new battery vehicles globally by 2025, including about 20 in North America. The company has said it aspires to make only electric passenger vehicles by 2035.

GM has said it plans to overtake Tesla as the world���s leading seller of electric vehicles. Tesla sold just under 353,000 EVs in the U.S. last year, according to estimates from Motorintelligence.com.

GM has started selling its Hummer large electric vehicles and plans to start making a Cadillac SUV next month. A Chevy Silverado electric pickup is to follow in 2024.

0,"World Economic Forum Wargames How To Push Digital ID, Vaccine Passports","A new document by the World Economic Forum (WEF) outlines how to introduce the world population to a digital ID system based on technology that will someday be ���embedded in the skin.���

The 46-page document called ���Advancing Digital Agency: The Power of Data Intermediaries��� claims that because a digital ID will be used for authentication in virtually every aspect of your life ��� from financial services to travel and commerce ��� the technology could ���enhance privacy protection��� and ���reduce rise of identity fraud.���


But if you dig deeper, the document goes on to explain how a digital ID won���t be used just for authentication, but also to record biometric attributes, credit and medical histories, online and purchasing behaviors, and even to control the ability to travel.


The WEF cites the widely unpopular vaccine passport as a ���form of digital ID��� the globalist body calls an ���incredible public health asset��� that ���verifies��� your private health information.

Such vaccine passports are used when travelling between jurisdictions and at a local level, such as when entering dining establishments or other places where proof of vaccination status is necessary. Importantly, these intermediaries provide a means of verifying status without sharing health data with the establishment per se, in a sort of zero-knowledge proof scenario whereby the trusted data intermediary verifies that the data subject is vaccinated but does not share any other information. This avoids unwanted secondary effects of the establishment sharing the data any further.

As we���ve reported, the digital ID is a key component of the WEF���s Great Reset agenda, which aims to transform the world���s economy and institutions into a global communist New World Order, where private property and free market enterprise no longer exist.

Another aspect of the digital ID and Great Reset, according to WEF founder and transhumanist Klaus Schwab, is to merge the physical, digital, and biological worlds to fundamentally change ���what it means to be human.���

0,Top Chinese Whistleblower Warns CCP May Deploy Hemorrhagic Fever Virus At Winter Olympics,"The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) could use the Winter Olympics as an outbreak vector for a new and more deadly virus developed by its military bioweapons program, according to virologist Dr. Li-Meng Yan.

���The CCP is enlarging their whole military-civilian fusion network���to develop their bioweapon industry,��� Dr. Yan said in a Saturday interview on the JD Rucker Show.

Dr. Yan explained that the CCP was developing more ���gain of function viruses��� mixed with powerful misinformation operations to sow more chaos when another outbreak occurs.

And a good testing ground for this next phase of their bioweapons program is the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, Dr. Yan claims.

���Intelligence also shows China would launch such bio-attacks during the Winter Olympics,��� Dr. Yan said.

���So the first thing is, the Winter Olympics is a great opportunity for the Chinese Communist Party,��� she continued. ���People [gather] somewhere, and then within a short while spread the bioweapon all over the world and it���s difficult for you to trace the origin.���

���Multiple sources also told me that the CCP are trying more bioweapons, especially the virus that causes hemorrhagic fever,��� she said, such as Ebola, Lassa, Marburg, or the hantavirus, which can cause 50% mortality ���without good treatment.���

Dr. Yan then described how the CCP recently locked down the northwest Shaanxi province after cases of hemorrhagic fever were recently reported, which the CCP claimed was simply an isolated outbreak of COVID-19.

���Our sources showed that this lockdown in Xian is a military drill. So there is not only one type of hemorrhagic fever virus released,��� Dr. Yan said, adding that the military separated the patients who were experiencing different symptoms from one another, such as Marburg symptoms.

���Such patients were sent to the military hospital, and other people didn���t even notice,��� she said.

Several cases of hemorrhagic fever were even reported in the UK just days ago, marking the first time the illness was found in the country in over a decade.

Dr. Yan claimed the CCP has discovered an antidote to these new deadlier hemorrhagic fever viruses: a Johnson & Johnson drug called Darzalex (daratumumab), an expensive drug currently used to treat multiple myeloma.

���This is not a common drug like hydroxychloroquine,��� she said, explaining that China plans to ���kidnap��� these antidotes all over the world once the ���panic��� from their hemorrhagic fever virus outbreak ensues.

Symptoms of hemorrhagic fever, depending on the virus, range from high fever and bleeding from the eyes and mouth, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting, shock, and even death in many cases.

Given Dr. Yan���s credentials and high credibility after blowing the whistle on the origins of COVID-19 and the CCP���s military bioweapons program in 2020, this information is particularly alarming and hopefully some U.S. lawmakers will take her warnings seriously.",FALSE,https://www.infowars.com/posts/top-chinese-whistleblower-warns-ccp-deploying-hemorrhagic-fever-virus-at-winter-olympics/,Science,Infowars
0,AI ���Nanny��� Being Created By Chinese Scientists To Grow Babies In Robot Wombs,"The artificial intelligence nanny has arrived. Robots and artificial intelligence (AI) may now be used in conjunction to optimize the generation of human life, marking a significant milestone in the science.

Robotics and artificial intelligence can now assist in the development of newborns via the use of algorithms and artificial wombs, which is eerily similar to what we see in the cult classic, The Matrix.

According to the South China Morning Post, Chinese experts in Suzhou have pioneered the development of the latest technological breakthrough. However, there are concerns about the ethical implications of raising human beings in an artificial environment.

The discoveries were published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Biomedical Engineering by Suzhou-based scientists. The AI nanny, according to the researchers, might aid in the growth of human kids in a ���long-term embryo culture device.���

This artificial womb is a big machine containing compartments for individual fetuses. The infants will be fed as they would be in a real womb if they are in the chamber, which will be filled with an optimized mix of ���nutritious fluids.���


A shocking video reveals the tyranny of Communist China in 2022.

In what seems sort of eugenics-y, a record of embryo health and ���developmental potential��� will be kept on file by the software over the duration of the embryo���s development.

It probably won���t happen any time soon..
At the moment, the new technology is being utilized to assist in the development of animal embryos that are developing into fetuses in the laboratory. This is due to the fact that the act of experimenting on human embryos older than two weeks is prohibited under international law.

Additionally, as the SMCP points out, surrogacy is prohibited in China. Because artificial wombs would effectively convert a hospital or laboratory into a mother under Chinese legislation, the technology is unlikely to be deployed in the area anytime soon.

Having said that, the development of artificial wombs is not a new concept. While this is not a new discovery, bringing the technology into human mass production and mixing it with ranking AI is, and it is a development that is quite dystopian sounding.

Of course, not everything is a hopeless dystopia..
Although the thought of artificially developing human infants is a far-fetched one, there are certain advantages to it. In the past, for example, the process of producing kids within people has been a lengthy, drawn-out, and unpleasant process, and this could potentially aid mothers who would like to have children, but are currently unable to, without having to use a human surrogate. After all, the population is about to start shrinking by the billions by the end of the century and fertility rates around the globe are collapsing at a frightening rate. 

This seems like more of a ���when��� rather than an ���if���..
When artificial human growth becomes available, it will enable couples who would otherwise be at danger during delivery to have children. Adoption is also an option for thousands of children currently in foster care who may be placed in permanent families.

0,BioNTech plans modular vaccine factories in Africa,"BERLIN (AP) ��� German vaccine maker BioNTech, which developed the first widely approved shot against COVID-19 together with Pfizer, unveiled plans Wednesday to establish manufacturing facilities in Africa that would boost the availability of much-needed medicines on the continent.

The modular design presented at a ceremony in Marburg, Germany, consists of shipping containers fitted with the equipment necessary to make the company���s mRNA-based vaccine, save for the final step of putting doses into bottles, a process known as fill and finish.

���Our goal is to enable mRNA production on all continents,��� BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin told The Associated Press.

BioNTech has been criticized by some campaign groups for refusing to suspend its vaccine patents and let rivals manufacture the shots as part of an effort to make them more widely available, especially in poor countries. The company argues that the process of making mRNA vaccines is difficult and it prefers to work with local partners to ensure consistent quality of the shots worldwide.

���Even collaborating with world-class companies, it takes three to four months just to ensure that the fill and finish (know-how) is transferred,��� Sahin said. ���And we have, of course, a limited capacity to do the full technology transfer.���

The first turnkey facility will be shipped to either Senegal or Rwanda in the second half of this year, BioNTech said. It aims to start production of up to 50 million doses of vaccine a year within 12 months, pending approval from local regulators.

That���s a fraction of the 1.2 billion doses the company produced in Marburg last year. But the vaccines made in the target country would likely be for use there and other African Union states at a not-for-profit price, BioNTech said.

BioNTech said it would initially staff and operate the facilities but later transfer the know-how to local partners to enable independent operation.

The system, which consists of 12 containers, could be scaled up easily in the future and modified to manufacture drugs for other diseases, such as malaria, cancer or tuberculosis, when they become available, the company said.

Sahin said adjusting the vaccine-manufacturing process also would be possible with the modular system.

���We could end up with vaccines requiring a lower dose or another formulation,��� he said.

The head of the World Health Organization, Secretary-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, welcomed BioNTech���s plan to increase vaccine production on the continent, saying it would complement the global body���s own effort to foster use of mRNA technology in South Africa and elsewhere.

WHO took the unusual step last year of teaming up with local companies and scientists to essentially replicate the mRNA-based COVID-19 shot made by U.S. company Moderna.

Sahin said BioNTech had no problem with other approaches.

���The more solutions are available, the better is the situation,��� he told the AP.

���We would like to bring our innovation to people worldwide,��� Sahin added. ���If others have similar aims, that���s perfect.���

Despite efforts to provide millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccine to Africa through an international donor mechanism, only about 11% of the population on the continent has received the shot, compared to the global average of about 50%.

0,S. Korea to give out rapid tests as omicron shatters record,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) ��� South Korea will distribute free coronavirus rapid test kits at schools and senior care facilities starting next week as it weathers an unprecedented wave of infections driven by the fast-moving omicron variant.

Health officials on Wednesday reported its highest daily jump in coronavirus infections with 90,443 new cases, shattering the previous one-day record set on Tuesday by more than 33,000 cases. The figure represents more than a 20-fold increase from the levels seen in mid-January, when omicron emerged as the country���s dominant strain, and some experts say the country could see daily cases of around 200,000 in March.

While experts say omicron appears less likely to cause serious illness or death compared to the delta variant, which rattled the country in December and early January, hospitalizations have been creeping up amid the greater scale of outbreak.

Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum, Seoul���s No. 2 official behind President Moon Jae-in, said officials will start distributing free rapid test kits next week at kindergartens, elementary schools and senior care facilities, including nursing homes and neighborhood welfare centers, to strengthen protection for unvaccinated children and high-risk groups.

Education Minister Yoo Eun-hye said schools will be getting enough kits for students to use twice a week, but added that such tests won���t be mandatory.

���We ask for students to be tested at home with the rapid antigen test kits on the evenings of Sunday and Wednesday before coming to school,��� Yoo said during a briefing. ���When testing positive from those tests, please visit the local health office to get PCR (lab) tests.���

Health workers have diagnosed a daily average of 60,230 new coronavirus cases in the past seven days, which translates to 116.64 infections per 100,000 people, as the national caseload grew over 1.55 million.

The fast-developing omicron surge has left officials debating whether the country should maintain strict social distancing rules, including a six-person limit on private social gatherings and a 9 p.m. curfew for restaurants.

Struggling business owners have called for the measures to be removed, questioning whether they are meaningful when cases are growing rapidly.

But health experts warn that easing social distancing may allow transmissions to veer further out of control, which would further stretch worn-out health and government workers and threaten high-risk groups and children younger than 12 who have yet to be vaccinated.

The country has already eased quarantine restrictions significantly starting this month to prevent major disruptions at workplaces and essential services, which may occur if huge numbers of people are constantly forced into isolation.

There are also concerns that transmissions could worsen as campaigning and political rallies began on Tuesday ahead of the March 9 presidential elections.

Prime Minister Kim said officials will consider both the pandemic���s growing economic strain and threats posed by the omicron surge before announcing new social distancing measures on Friday.

While omicron more easily infects those who have been vaccinated or had COVID-19 previously, experts say vaccination and booster shots still provide strong protection from serious illness and death.

More than 86% of South Koreans have been fully vaccinated and 58% have received booster shots. Health officials plan to offer fourth vaccination shots at nursing homes and other long-term care settings starting later this month.

The country also started offering Novavax���s coronavirus vaccine at hospitals and public health offices this week, adding another tool in a mass immunization campaign that has mainly depended on Pfizer and Moderna���s mRNA vaccines.

China has been able to control the virus within its borders by maintaining a strict ���zero tolerance��� policy that involves total lockdowns, extensive contact tracing and mass testing millions of people. The strategy seeks to contain outbreaks as soon as they are detected.

Lam has stuck to the strategy despite geographical and other differences between Hong Kong and other parts of China. Last week, the entire upscale Discovery Bay neighborhood in Hong Kong was ordered to undergo testing after authorities found traces of the virus in its sewage.

The comments from Xi and Zheng were the latest pressure from Beijing for her to stay the course.

Thousands of people in the city have tested positive for COVID-19 and are waiting to be admitted into hospitals or isolation facilities, said Dr. Sara Ho, the chief manager for patient safety and risk management at the Hong Kong Hospital Authority.

���This situation is undesirable. Therefore, we are looking for ways with the government to set up more isolation facilities. We hope to shorten the patients��� waiting time,��� she added.

People who test positive are required to quarantine either in hospitals if they have serious symptoms or in government-run facilities for light or asymptomatic cases. The record number of new cases, driven by the highly transmissible omicron variant, has led to the current overcrowding.

Yancey Yau, a construction worker, said the city���s hospital workers are facing heavy stress.

���They are working so hard. But the government is not doing what they should do,��� Yau said. ���The hospital workers are just miserable. I hope more citizens will support them. I don���t have any hope for this government.���

By contrast, the city-state of Singapore, which is similarly sized to Hong Kong with a population of some 5.7 million compared to 7.5 million, undertook strict lockdown measures early in the pandemic but is now pursuing a ���living with COVID��� approach.

The number of new cases per capita in Singapore has skyrocketed with the arrival of omicron, with 1,911 new cases per million people reported on Monday, versus 66 per million in Hong Kong, according to Our World in Data.

But people testing positive who have no symptoms or only mild symptoms just need to self-quarantine at home, and even those who have more severe symptoms are told to see a physician for medical advice before going to the hospital.

Consequently, it is not suffering the stress on its health care system that Hong Kong is now experiencing.

Singapore also boasts one of the world���s highest vaccination rates, with 88% of its population fully vaccinated, compared to Hong Kong���s 64%.",TRUE,https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-beijing-xi-jinping-hong-kong-6700d6a93c19f47ebb0a0ec7b9e0e413,Science,AP

The nation���s leading health officials said Wednesday that the U.S. is moving closer to the point that COVID-19 is no longer a ���constant crisis��� as more cities, businesses and sports venues began lifting pandemic restrictions around the country.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said during a White House briefing that the government is contemplating a change to its mask guidance in the coming weeks. Noting recent declines in COVID-19 cases, hospital admissions and deaths, she acknowledged ���people are so eager��� for health officials to ease masking rules and other measures designed to stop the spread of the coronavirus.

���We all share the same goal ��� to get to a point where COVID-19 is no longer disrupting our daily lives, a time when it won���t be a constant crisis ��� rather something we can prevent, protect against, and treat,��� Walensky said.

With the omicron variant waning and Americans eager to move beyond the virus, government and business leaders have been out ahead of the CDC in ending virus measures in the last week, including ordering workers back to offices, eliminating mask mandates and no longer requiring proof of vaccine to get into restaurants, bars and sports and entertainment arenas.

The efforts have been gaining more steam each day.

Philadelphia officials on Wednesday said the city���s vaccine mandate for restaurants was immediately lifted, though indoor mask mandates remain in place for now. At Disney World, vaccinated guests will no longer have to wear masks at the Florida theme park starting Thursday. Professional sports teams including the Utah Jazz and Washington Wizards and Capitals have stopped requiring proof of vaccine for fans.

Health Commissioner Cheryl Bettigole said Philadelphia���s average daily case count had dropped to 189 cases per day in the city of more than 1.5 million people. Bettigole said the plunge in infections has been steeper in Philadelphia than elsewhere in the state or the country, making it easier to lift the vaccine mandate for restaurants and other businesses announced in mid-December and that just fully went into effect this month.

���Our goal has always been to the least restrictive as possible while ensuring safety,��� she said.

In Provincetown, Massachusetts, a seaside town that became a COVID hot spot with an early outbreak of the delta variant last summer, officials on Tuesday lifted a mask mandate and vaccine requirement for indoor spaces like restaurants and bars. Town Manager Alex Morse said the community of about 3,000 recorded zero active cases last week among Provincetown residents ��� something that hasn���t happened since the surge following last year���s July 4 celebrations.

���We are learning to live with, and mitigate, the impact of the virus on our community,��� Morse said.

COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations have fallen sharply in the U.S., with the seven-day rolling average for daily new cases dropping from about 453,000 two weeks ago to about 136,000 as of Tuesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Hospitalizations are at levels similar to September, when the U.S. was emerging from the delta variant surge. Almost 65% of Americans are fully vaccinated.

���As a result of all this progress and the tools we now have, we are moving to a time where COVID isn���t a crisis but is something we can protect against and treat,��� said Jeff Zients, the White House coronavirus response coordinator.

Walensky said the CDC ���will soon put guidance in place that is relevant and encourages prevention measures when they are most needed to protect public health and our hospitals.��� She suggested any changes will take into account measures of community transmission, as well as hospitalization rates or other gauges of whether infected people are becoming severely ill. They also would consider available bed space in hospitals.

Several states with indoor mask mandates announced last week they would be lifted in coming weeks, also citing promising numbers.

Two music festivals that draw thousands of people to the California desert town of Indio in April and May, Coachella and Stagecoach, also said this week there will be no vaccination, masking or testing mandates in accordance with local guidelines. Coachella also noted that could change along with COVID conditions.

In Philadelphia, Bettigole said the vaccine mandate helped spur ���a very large��� increase in pediatric vaccinations, pushing the city way ahead of the national average for first doses among kids ages 5 to 11. More than 53% of Philadelphia residents in that age group have received a first dose, compared to closer to 30% nationally, she said.

Not all businesses plan to immediately change course. Philadelphia Irish sports bar and restaurant O���Neals will keep asking to see customers��� vaccination cards for now, said managing partner Greg ���Spoonie��� Rand, even though the city is lifting its vaccine mandate.

���Guests are more compliant and employees are more happy for us to continue doing vaccine cards inside,��� he said. He thinks vaccinated people will be wary of coming in if the pub stops checking cards.

Walensky said the CDC wants to ���give people a break from things like mask-wearing��� when circumstances improve, though be able to mask up again if things worsen. She also said there will be instances where people should continue to wear masks even if prevention measures ease. Examples include when individuals have symptoms of COVID-19 or are within 10 days after being diagnosed with it.",TRUE,https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-health-pandemics-rochelle-walensky-b55c18049f901dff2a9d83aa9557bbd1,Science,AP
0,"King County ending vaccine requirements at bars, restaurants","SEATTLE (AP) ��� Washington���s most populous county will no longer require COVID vaccination checks to enter restaurants, bars, theaters and gyms beginning March 1.

King County officials made the announcement Wednesday. The Seattle Times reports from March 1, businesses will be free to impose their own vaccination requirements if they choose, but there will be no countywide requirement.

Since last fall, indoor eateries and cultural and recreational spaces have been required to verify their customers��� vaccination status or a negative COVID test, as a condition for entry.

The policy has also applied to outdoor events with more than 500 people, like concerts and sporting events.

���Our public health experts believe that now is the appropriate time to lift vaccine verification, based on high rates of vaccine coverage and the decrease in new cases and hospitalizations across the county,��� King County Executive Dow Constantine said Wednesday.

Constantine and Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell also announced that they will begin, gradually, calling back to the office the thousands of county and city employees who have been working remotely for nearly two years. King County has an estimated 7,000 employees who have been working remotely, and Seattle has about 5,000.",TRUE,https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-health-public-health-seattle-d01263e5182f7a084c00350820f0ebf6,Science,AP
0,Gwyneth Paltrow���s Vagina-Scented Candle Is Reportedly Giving People Herpes in Their Nasal Passages,"Gwyneth Paltrow, who has been shilling garbage Goop products for years ��� items that have been proven multiple times to be a sham at best, and potentially life-threatening in their bad pseudoscience at worst. But her latest endeavor, Goop candles that smell like her former A-list vagina, have added a new treat for people dumb enough to buy it ��� the candles are giving people herpes in their nose.

Paltrow, perhaps best known for playing Robert Downey Jr.���s love interest, Pepper Potts, in the Iron Man films, has fallen to the levels of midnight pitchman over the last few years, and for some reason thought that selling candles scented specifically like her putrid pussy would be hot sellers. Somewhat confusingly, she appears to be right, as the candles are selling, but as they are made from the ���natural juices��� of Paltrow���s poon, they smell like her vagina, and are also causing people who burn the candle too long to contract herpes.

���I first noticed that I had a weird bump on the outside of my nose,��� said Kirk Brown, who has estimated he���s spent around $2,000 on several hundreds of Paltrow���s candles. ���I thought it was a pimple. It happens. After it got severe, and I started to feel the bumps in my nose, I went to the doctor. A test confirmed it was nose herpes. I didn���t even know it was possible!���

���I only burned one of her candles for a very short time,��� said Melissa Rogers of Atlanta. ���I got it as a gag gift from a co-worker at Christmastime. It smelled horrendous; like a cross between stale pee and the cheese you scrape out of an infected vagina. I was not a fan. I became less of a fan when it became clear that I was getting nose herpes. It���s hugely embarrassing.���

Multiple people say they have had similar experiences, and a lawyer has been contacted in at least one of the cases in hopes of a class-action suit.

0,Man Who Bought a Pair of Dentures on Shopping App WISH Can Suddenly Speak Chinese,"A Boston man, Arnold Richardson, said he didn���t know what to do when his dentist told him that he was going to need a new set of custom dentures to replace the ones he���s had the last 10 years.

���I was really put out, I can���t afford that kind of thing on my salary,��� said Richardson, 46, a carpenter in the South End of Boston. ���I really felt lost.���

Richardson said that he scoped out the internet for the best deals, and was surprised to find a set of dentures on the shopping website/app called Wish, which sells items at highly discounted rates, occassionally knock-offs, but almost always shipped from China.

���I was hesitant, honestly, because you hear about toys and other items coming from China and they���ve been painted with old, lead-ridden paint or something like that, but really, it was all I could afford.���

After waiting 6-8 weeks for his dentures, Richardson said he was ���very surprised��� to find that they fit perfectly, and even more surprised that when he put them in his mouth, he automatically began speaking Chinese.",FALSE,https://empirenews.net/man-who-bought-a-pair-of-dentures-on-shopping-app-wish-can-suddenly-speak-chinese/,Science,Empirenews
0,California Passes Law to Completely Ban Cigarette Sales,"Lawmakers in California have passed a new law through the House that will completely abolish the sale of cigarettes throughout the state, according to reports. The new regulation, which will cost the state billions in tax revenue, will supposedly save upwards of 2 million lives per year.

���We have known forever that smoking is stupid shit, so why are we still selling cigarettes? Why is this still a thing?��� said Representative John Lyman ��� D, California. ���There is absolutely no reason to smoke. None. It doesn���t have a single actual benefit. It���s not like smoking weed, which, let���s face it, is awesome. Banning the sale will save lives, and help children not pick up the habit.���

The law will not go into effect until January of 2020, but Lyman says he hopes that many stores stop selling before then.

���I doubt they will, but it really is something we���re hoping the public helps us with,��� said Lyman. ���I mean shit, this isn���t Alabama. We���re a lot more sophisticated here.���",FALSE,https://empirenews.net/california-passes-law-to-completely-ban-cigarette-sales/,Science,Empirenews
