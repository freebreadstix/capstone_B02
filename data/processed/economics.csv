1509,Baldwin taking wait and see approach on tariffs,"Getty MADISON, Wis. - Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin is withholding judgment for now on President Donald Trump's proposal to increase steel and aluminum tariffs. The proposal has generated broad opposition from Republicans, including Gov. Scott Walker, while liberal Democrats and unions have praised the move. Baldwin said Tuesday she wants to see all the details of the administration's plan first. Baldwin says she supports sending a ""strong message to bad actors"" like Russia and China, but she also fears a blanket tariff could start a trade war with allies like Canada and hurt Wisconsin manufacturers and the state's agricultural economy. Baldwin's two Republican challengers didn't take firm positions on Trump's plan. Republican Sen. Leah Vukmir's campaign manager says she applauds Trump fighting for better trade deals. And a spokesman for Delafield businessman Kevin Nicholson says he supports renegotiating trade deals to benefit the U.S.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2018/mar/12/leah-vukmir/Vukmir-misfires-on-Baldwin-trade-barb/,Economy,Polifact
1574,Trump's Tariffs Look Like a Self-Inflicted Wound,"There's a right way  and a wrong way  to help. Trade wars, President Donald Trump recently declared on Twitter, are good, and easy to win. But its questionable whether the presidents proposed tariffs -- a tax of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on imported aluminum -- will be a war or an act of friendly fire. As I recently wrote, tariffs are generally not a good way to promote domestic industry. They encourage American producers to hunker down behind the taxs protective wall, focusing on the captive local market instead of figuring out how to prevail in the rough-and-tumble of global competition. Forcing American consumers to use the domestic-made product might eventually result in American steel and aluminum becoming bywords for low quality. Theres also the danger that making metals more expensive will hurt a lot more U.S. manufacturers than it helps. The construction industry would take the biggest hit: Where the Pain Would Be Felt the Most Share of total U.S. steel use by industry Source: Statista.com Import taxes will tend to drive already exorbitant U.S. construction costs even higher, hurting commercial development around the country. It will also harm U.S. exporters. The U.S. makes a lot of internationally tradeable products that use steel -- aircraft, autos, appliances and industrial machinery. A lot of others use aluminum. Although the majority of what they use is produced locally -- the U.S. steel industry supplied about 70 percent of the domestic market in 2017 -- a tax on imports will allow American metal producers to charge more to companies like Boeing Co., General Motors Co. and Whirlpool Corp. Higher steel and aluminum company profits will therefore come at the expense of these other American manufacturers -- exporters like Caterpillar Inc. and Harley-Davidson Inc. are already warning that the tariff would put them at a competitive disadvantage in world markets. No wonder shares of these companies slid after the tariff plan was announced: That Didn't Feel So Great Indexed share performance of companies that might be hurt by tariffs Source: Bloomberg So Trumps ham-fisted attempts to protect one American industry seem likely to deal a blow to many others. This is the exact opposite of the increased international manufacturing prowess that Trump has promised. Defenders of the tariffs argue that steel and aluminum are important for national defense, and so need to be protected even at the cost of less martial industries. But military shipbuilders will be hurt by higher metals prices, as will makers of tanks, planes, guns and other crucial defense equipment. Nor will the tariffs bring back good jobs at steel and aluminum factories. Since 1990, production of metals in the U.S. has held roughly constant, but the number of people employed in the industry has fallen steadily: Look Elsewhere for the Growth Story of Tomorrow Industrial production of primary metal* Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Doing the Same With Fewer People Employment in primary metals production Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis The reason is technology. Productivity has improved, even as demand has stayed more or less constant. Mathematically, that means fewer jobs for steel and aluminum workers. Tariffs wont change that equation. If anything, by hurting downstream industries like car and equipment manufacturers, the new import taxes will probably kill more factory jobs than they save. So Trumps metals tariffs look likely to be a self-inflicted wound for the U.S. -- even if they dont spark retaliation from trading partners, and even if they dont weaken American alliances. If Trump wants to help the steel and aluminum industries, there are better ways to do it. Instead of letting U.S. metal-makers charge higher prices to other American industries, the government could focus on helping to raise exports. The reason domestic steel production hasnt grown isnt because of cheap imports; its the fact that the U.S. market hasnt grown. The U.S. is a mature economy with a lot of existing buildings, infrastructure and vehicles, meaning that its consumption of metal can be expected to grow only slowly. Countries in Asia and Africa, however, need lots of new steel to fuel their economic development. The U.S., which makes higher-quality steel than countries like China, could potentially be supplying much of those countries needs. Currently, U.S. steel companies command only 2 percent of world exports, compared with 24 percent by China. There are things the government could do to improve that situation, including export promotion, export loans and assistance for small producers looking to break into world markets. Selling more steel and aluminum abroad is a much better bet than trying to capture a bigger slice of a stagnating pie back home. So far, though, Trump has shown more interest in trade war for its own sake than in actually helping U.S. companies compete. Tariffs might make Trump and his diehard followers feel better, but theyll hurt more American pocketbooks than they benefit.

1664,CNNs Brianna Keilar Embarrasses NRA-Supporting Lawmaker Over Delta Discounts,"A Republican candidate for governor in Georgia tried to spread fake news on CNN Tuesday afternoon, but anchor Brianna Keilar didnt let him. Keilar, who gained notoriety for her remarkable Says who? moment with Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, repeatedly disputed a claim from State Sen. Michael Williams (R-GA) about Delta Air Lines discounts. Along with his fellow Republican gubernatorial candidate, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, Williams has threatened to punish Delta for eliminating its discount for National Rifle Association members in the wake of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting. During his appearance on CNN Tuesday, he argued that if Delta is going to give discounts to Planned Parenthood members, they should do the same for the NRA. One problem: Theres no evidence that there is a Planned Parenthood discount for Delta Air Lines. Where are you getting that, that Delta gives a discount to Planned Parenthood members? Keilar asked her guest. I need to be clear on this. You just indicated that they give discounts to Planned Parenthood members. I havent seen that anywhere. Ive seen allegations of that on right-wing blogs. Ive had no verification of that. We have people looking at that. Where are you getting that? Williams admitted that he looked it up on Google, but could not provide a source and said he still believes very firmly that its true. To be clear, we looked it up as well and it doesnt appear after some digging that weve been able to determine that that is actually factual, Keilar said. Youre indicating something that may not be true there. If youre making that argument, shouldnt you have your facts straight? Are you telling me Delta is not giving away discounts to left-leaning organizations, is that what youre telling me? No, you told me it was Planned Parenthood, she said. Theres no indication they are giving discounts to that organization is my point. I guess agree to disagree, Williams said, finally.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2018/mar/02/michael-williams-georgia/georgia-senators-false-claim-about-delta-discount-/,Economy,Polifact
1899,Republican gubernatorial hopefuls debate in Amherst,"Three candidates seeking the Republican nomination to run against Governor Andrew Cuomo this fall appeared in Amherst Saturday morning, where they took turns taking shots at the incumbent and his policies, including the Buffalo Billion. The debate was hosted by Daemen College and sponsored by the Erie County Republican Committee. Part One of the Republican gubernatorial candidate debate hosted by Daemen College and sponsored by the Erie County Republican Committee. Erie County GOP Chairman Nick Langworthy makes the opening remarks. Part Two of the Republican gubernatorial candidate debate Saturday morning, February 10, hosted by Daemen College and sponsored by the Erie County Republican Committee. We continue with debate moderator Andrea Bozek asking a question. ""Nothing is more important to the Republican Party than defeating Andrew Cuomo,"" said Erie County GOP chairman Nick Langworthy in his opening remarks. ""It is the absolutely number one objective of the Erie County Republican Committee to do everything we can. We thought it was very important to bring these candidates to you. so you could hear them."" Former Erie County and City of Buffalo elected official Joel Giambra, longtime State Senator John DeFrancisco and former Housing Commissioner for the Pataki Administration Joe Holland took turns criticizing Governor Cuomo's Buffalo Billion program, an energy policy that bans hydrofracking, the state's taxes and regulations, ethical troubles in Albany and education policies including the Excelsior program. The criticism began with the Buffalo Billion. ""The Buffalo Billion, unfortunately, has been a tremendous public failure,"" said Giambra, a businessman who previously served as the Erie County Executive, Buffalo Comptroller and Buffalo Common Councilmember. ""What the governor attempted to do here was to gain political access, if you will, to Western New York because of the tremendous beating he took by (former gubernatorial candidate) Carl Paladino. This was his way of trying to find a way to ingratiate himself politically, using taxpayer dollars to fund a billion-dollar building that today sits, virtually, almost empty."" That building is the Tesla/Panasonic Gigafactory 2 factory in Buffalo's Riverbend neighborhood. Holland spoke of the factory while criticizing Cuomo for an energy policy that entirely eliminated hydrofracking as an option. ""Unfortunately, this governor has been colonized by the environmental lobby,"" he said. ""All of these policies, solar panel factories, it's not based on grassroots and an economically driven approach in order to create the kind of development that's needed. It's dictated by policies of the far left and that's unfortunate because it won't work."" John DeFrancisco, who hails from Syracuse, has spent the past 25 years in the State Senate and is giving up his seat to run, and with it his influential role as Deputy Majority Leader. He, too, considers Buffalo's Gigafactory 2 a Cuomo failure. ""The governor does things based upon the political benefit he is going to get,"" DeFrancisco said. ""He had a great news conference, thousands of jobs. There was nothing behind it. There was no clawbacks. There was no security that the taxpayer had, once he did that. And so, not thousands of jobs. It's down to 200."" DeFrancisco went on to say that Buffalo is not alone. ""Look at the Soraa project in Syracuse,"" he continued. ""A $90 million building sitting there empty. And you know what he wants to do? No penalties for them walking away."" Like DeFrancisco and Giambra, Holland is an Upstate New York resident, hailing from Auburn. He explained during the debate that he holds ""upstate roots but also downtown credibility."" ""I'm the only statewide candidate for governor that can put together that winning coalition,"" Holland said. ""I can do that, not only because I will make history as the first African-American Republican candidate for governor, but I also have a track record of service, of making a difference in the New York City area. Out of that comes a network of supporters I can cultivate to vote for me and move the numbers in a positive direction."" DeFrancisco, like Holland, thinks even New York City voters have acquired a ""Cuomo fatigue"" that may work to the Republican Party's advantage. He suggested Cuomo and New York City mayor Bill De Blasio are not on speaking terms. ""Just look at the papers over the summer, the 'summer from hell' with the subway system,"" he said. ""How does the governor deal with it? He doesn't say 'it's my problem, I've made some mistakes, I'm going to correct it.' He blames De Blasio."" The Republican hopefuls also noted the current corruption trial of former Cuomo aide Joseph Percoco during the debate. The overall tone of the debate was cordial, with no candidate attacking any other. Giambra did say he was the only candidate among the three with a record of cutting taxes and, after the debate, offered a hint of how he may position himself against one of his opponents. ""Mr. DeFrancisco has been in the Senate for a long time. He's voted for all these budgets. It's going to be very hard for him, I think, to be able to ask the voters to send him back to Albany to fix the problems that he helped create,"" Giambra said. DeFrancisco, following the debate, was asked if being a longtime lawmaker in a Legislature where many other have been disgraced with scandal might work against him. He believes voters will quickly realize he's not ""part of the machine."" ""If people watch what I have done over the years, as far as the advocacy against some of the things that have happened, I don't think they will take me in that light,"" he replied. The field of GOP contenders was reduced to three following Friday's surprise withdrawal from the race by Assembly Minority Leader Brian Kolb, who cited a desire to spend more time with family. ""This is going to be a competitive race for the Republican nomination,"" Holland said. ""At this point there are three candidates, two who have served in elected office. One is an Albany insider. What I bring to the race is the difference that's needed for the Republicans to win back the State House."" In his opening remarks, New York State Republican Chairman Edward Cox said New York State is the least business-friendly of all states in the nation and 11 years of policies under Democratic governors has worsened conditions and killed jobs. ""New York State is a blue state. But we are not Manhattan or West Side blue, we are blue collar blue. That's New York State,"" said Cox. ""New York State wants good jobs and Republican governors will bring good jobs to New York State.""",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/new-york/statements/2018/feb/16/edward-cox/new-york-state-leads-country-government-debt-resid/,Economy,Polifact
2196,NFIB,"The Small Business Optimism Index increased in May to the second highest level in the NFIB surveys 45-year history. The index rose to 107.8, a three-point gain, with small businesses reporting high numbers in several key areas including compensation, profits, and sales trends. Main Street optimism is on a stratospheric trajectory thanks to recent tax cuts and regulatory changes. For years, owners have continuously signaled that when taxes and regulations ease, earnings and employee compensation increase, said NFIB President and CEO Juanita Duggan. The May report hit several records:  Compensation increases hit a 45-year high at a record net 35 percent.  Positive earnings trends reached a survey high at a net three percent.  Positive sales trends are at the highest level since 1995.  Expansion plans are the most robust in survey history. In another interesting marker, a net 19 percent of small business owners are planning price increases, the highest since 2008 and a signal of a strong economy. A net three percent reported positive profit trends, up four points and the best reading in the surveys history. In addition, a net 15 percent reported higher nominal sales in the past three months, up an astonishing seven points and the sixth consecutive strong month for sales. Small business owners are continuing an 18-month streak of unprecedented optimism which is leading to more hiring and raising wages, said NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg. While they continue to face challenges in hiring qualified workers, they now have more resources to commit to attracting candidates. Small business owners continue to hire with a seasonally-adjusted net 18 percent planning to create new jobs. Twenty-nine percent of owners have job openings for skilled workers, the third highest reading since 2000. Twelve percent have job openings for unskilled workers, with the strongest demand in the transportation, travel, communications, and utilities sector. To compete in the job market, 35 percent of owners reported increases in labor compensation to attract job applicants. The percentage of owners reporting capital outlays moved up one point to 62 percent, with 47 percent reporting spending on new equipment, 24 percent acquiring vehicles, and 16 percent improving expanded facilities. Thirty percent plan capital outlays in the next few months. Access to credit continues as a non-issue with 37 percent of owners reporting all credit needs were satisfied and 43 percent saying they were not interested in a loan, down seven points from last month and the lowest reading since 2007. Only one percent reported that financing was their top business problem. Owners planning to build inventories rose three points to a net four percent, the nineteenth positive reading in the past 20 months. As reported in NFIBs May jobs report, 23 percent of owners cited the difficulty of finding qualified workers as their Single Most Important Business Problem, followed by taxes at 17 percent and regulations at 13 percent. Fifty-eight percent reported hiring or trying to hire, up one point from last month but 83 percent of those reported few or no qualified workers.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-correct-small-business-optimism-recor/,Economy,Polifact
3298,Get big money out of California politics,"California has proudly declared itself the leader of the resistance, a progressive counter to the Trump administrations continual assault on the rule of law and the most vulnerable among us. However, for California to truly lead our nation forward, we need to create a real system of public financing for political campaigns in order to get big money, and the stink of potential corruption, out of our government. Last week, Gov. Jerry Brown signed the Disclose Act, a product of a multiyear, comprehensive effort to shine a light on dark money that has invaded our political system. I proudly endorsed the Disclose Act, but we must go further. There is no doubt in my mind that our democracy is in trouble. Big money in politics adds to public cynicism and subtracts from our faith in our form of government. In a democracy, the government is us. To lose faith in government means that we have lost faith in each other. This lack of faith rips apart the fabric of our civil society and allows the worst among us to rule. Budgets are statements of values, and, in the words of the late Sen. and Vice President Hubert Humphrey, the moral test of government is how it treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the aged; and those in the shadows of life, the sick, (and) the needy. I am afraid that our democracy is under significant assault because we are failing this moral test, even here in California, where we have the highest number and percentage of poor children in the country. People become cynical because the path to a brighter future is becoming more remote. Ninety percent of people born in the 1940s ended up doing better financially than their parents. But those born in the 1980s, the much-maligned Millennials, have only a 50-50 chance of doing better than their parents , despite being the best-educated generation in our history. While I fully support a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United, the Supreme Court decision that lifted limits on corporate and union political spending, that battle will likely take many years. Californians cannot afford to wait. In 2016, the pharmaceutical industry spent more than $100 million to prevent voters from regulating the price of prescription drugs  and won. The high cost of our elections means that people of modest means dont consider running for office. It also means that politicians who do run find themselves on a never-ending path of fundraising instead of governing. Politicians should be meeting with their constituents, listening to their aspirations and concerns, and taking these ideas back to the Capitol to craft sound, progressive and beneficial policy. Did you know that the maximum donation to a candidate for governor of California is $29,200, just for the primary election? One married couple can contribute more than $116,000 in the primary and general elections combined. We have a moral imperative to get this kind of money out of politics and create a clean system of public financing for campaigns. This isnt a partisan issue. The voters understand that something is rotten in politics, and sometimes that rottenness is enacted into law. Californians can improve our system of government by passing state legislation modeled after the Fair Elections Now Act, which is pending federal legislation supported by Common Cause, Sen. Bernie Sanders and many others. A statewide campaign-finance law should set hard limits on large-dollar donors, offer public financing and establish requirements for candidate participation in debates. This would help reduce the cynicism and malaise affecting our youngest voters and encourage them to engage in the act of participatory democracy. If Californians organize, we can get big money out of our political system and put direct democracy back into the hands of the people. As California goes, so goes the nation. Delaine Eastin, the former California superintendent of public instruction, is a candidate for governor.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2017/oct/27/delaine-eastin/do-millennials-have-only-50-50-chance-doing-better/,Economy,Polifact
4248,Full Transcript and Video: Trumps News Conference in New York,"Now I knew the process very well, probably better than anybody. I had to get permits for this building and many of the buildings I built, all of the buildings I built in Manhattan and many other places. And I will tell you that the consultants are rich people. They go around making it very difficult. They lobby Congress. They lobby state government, city governments to make it very difficult so that you have to hire consultants and that you have to take years and pay them a fortune. So we are streamlining the process, and we wont be having so much of that anymore. No longer will we allow the infrastructure of our magnificent country to crumble and decay. While protecting the environment, we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, railways, waterways, tunnels and highways. We will rebuild our country with American workers, American iron, American aluminum, American steel. We will create millions of new jobs and make millions of American dreams come true. Our infrastructure will again be the best in the world. We used to have the greatest infrastructure anywhere in the world. And today, we are like a third-world country. We are literally like a third-world country. Our infrastructure will again be the best. And we will restore the pride in our communities, our nation. And all over the United States will be proud again. So I want to thank everybody for being here. God bless you. God bless the United States. And if you have any questions, we have Mick. You could come up here, please. Come on up. Mick Mulvaney. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. REPORTER: Why do you think these C.E.O.s are leaving your manufacturing council? TRUMP: Because theyre not taking their jobs seriously as it pertains to this country. But we want jobs, manufacturing in this country. If you look at some of those people that you are talking about, they are outside of the country. They are having a lot of their product made outside. If you look at Merck as an example, take a look  excuse me, excuse me  take a look at where their product is made. Its made outside of our country. We want products made in the country. Now I have to tell you, some of the folks that will leave, theyre leaving out of embarrassment, because they make their products outside. And I have been lecturing them, including the gentleman that you are referring to, about you have to bring it back to this country. You cant do it necessarily in Ireland and all of these other places. You have to bring this work back to this country. Thats what I want. I want manufacturing to be back into the United States so that American workers can benefit. REPORTER: Why did you wait so long  [cross talk] TRUMP: I didnt wait long. I didnt wait long. I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct, not make a quick statement. The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement but you dont make statements that direct unless you know the facts. It takes a little while to get the facts. You still dont know the facts. It is a very, very important process to me. It is a very important statement. So I dont want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement. I want to know the facts. If you go back to my statement, I brought it. I brought it. [cross talk] As I said, remember, Saturday, we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence. It has no place in America. And then I went on from there. Here is the thing. Excuse me. Take it nice and easy. Here is the thing. When I make a statement, I like to be correct. I want the facts. This event just happened. In fact, a lot of the event didnt happen yet as we were speaking. This event just happened. Before I make a statement, I need the facts. So I dont want to rush into a statement. So making the statement when I made it was excellent. In fact, the young woman, who I hear is a fantastic young woman, and it was on NBC, her mother wrote me and said through I guess Twitter, social media, the nicest things. And I very much appreciated that. I hear she was a fine, really actually, an incredible young woman. Her mother, on Twitter, thanked me for what I said. And honestly, if the press were not fake and if it was honest, the press would have said what I said was very nice. But unlike you  [cross talk]... and unlike the media, before I make a statement, I like to know the facts. [cross talk] How about a couple of infrastructure questions.

Although the President finds himself embroiled in controversies and policy fights in Washington, D.C., that range from the Russia investigation to health care, those issues were largely left behind in the beltway. Tonight Im back in the center of the American heartland, far away from the Washington swamp to spend time with thousands of true American patriots, he told the crowd, as cheers of drain the swamp filled the arena. And, despite reports of infighting and recent staff shakeups in the White House, Trump touted the ease of being President, pushing back against claims that he has not acted presidential. Its much easier, by the way, to act presidential than what were doing here tonight, believe me, he said. And I said with the exception of the late great Abraham Lincoln, I can be more presidential than any president thats ever held this office. That I can tell you. Its real easy. But sadly, we have to move a little faster than that. Read the full transcript below: Thank you, Melania, America loves our First Lady, thank you.

And finally, we believe that family and faith, not government and bureaucracy, are the foundation of our society. Youve heard me say it before on the campaign trail and Ill say it again tonight. In America we dont worship government. We worship God. [cheers from crowd]. Tonight were going to set aside the cynics and the critics because we know exactly why they are so angry and so bitter.

And I dont want to sound silly or anything, but i thought what would I say to the President if I ever got to meet him, which this is an honest to god over the top moment for me. I thought you know Im just going to tell him something. And sir, like I said, thank you for Justice Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. Right? That started it all. And then I apologize, I said Mr. President, thank you for Melania. Could we have a more outstanding First Lady? Im probably going to be in trouble with my wife, but God bless that woman. And then last thing I said and I dont think he thought I was going to take this much time but anybody that knows me, this is gonna happen, I said thank you sir for keeping the promises you made. To these 12,000 people and to the country. In my recommendation sir, look what you could do in the bastion of the Democratic party. I dont think theres anyone except Cayahuga County who is more Democratic than us. Look who you could draw. I go back to Washington, I would tell the Republicans and the Democrats, Look. I am going to go do my rallies. You got the agenda. Those people are voting for me and mine. Do what you want. Pass my agenda or were going out on the road. Thank you sir. An absolute honor. Thank you sir. Trump: Thank you, Gino. What a man. I watched him this morning, I said, we got to find this guy, hes just a great person. Always a Democrat, now its gone. Ill tell you what, I rode through your beautiful roads coming up from the airport, and I was looking at some of those big once incredible job-producing factories, and my wife, Melania, said what happened? I said, those jobs have left Ohio. Theyre all coming back. Theyre all coming back. [cheers from crowd].Dont move. Dont sell your house. Dont sell your house. Remember, i got a lot of credit. This is hard to believe but the press gave me a lot of credit because a number of years ago I said this is the time to buy a house during one of my speeches. I said, go out and buy, and they did this big story, Trump predicted. Let me tell you folks in Ohio and in this area, dont sell your house. Dont sell your house. Do not sell it. Were going to get those values up. Were going to get those jobs coming back, and were going to fill up those factories or rip them down and build brand new ones. Its going to happen. [Cheers from crowd] Were gonna have it so that Americans can once again speak the magnificent words of Alexander Hamilton, here the people govern. Political correctness for me is easy. Sometimes they say he doesnt act Presidential. And I say, hey look, great schools, smart guy, its so easy to act presidential but thats not gonna to get it done. In fact, I said its much easier, by the way, to act presidential than what were doing here tonight, believe me. And I said  and I said with the exception of the late great Abraham Lincoln, i can be more presidential than any President thats ever held this office. That I can tell you. Its real easy. [Cheers] But sadly, we have to move a little faster than that. We will never be beholden to the lobbyists or the special interests. We will never be silenced by the media. I want to protect America, and i want to protect the citizens of america. Your hopes are my hopes. Your dreams are my dreams. Ive had a great successful career. Ive built a great, great business. This is the only thing that matters. This is the only thing that matters. There is nothing else. Your future is what Im fighting for each and every day. Here is just a small sample of what we have accomplished in just our first six months in office. And Ill say this and they always like to say,well, I dont know. But I think that with few exceptions no president has done anywhere near what weve done in his first six months. Not even close. But they dont let you know. They dont want to write about it. That unemployment last month hit a 16-year low. Since my election, weve added much more than 1 million jobs. Think of that. And remember I came in and some people said, dont say that. Id say, what do you have to lose? I talked about the inner city, and I talked about the crime and the problems and the lack of education, and I talked to my African-American friends and I said, vote for me, what the hell do you have to lose? Do you remember that? The Hispanic, the African-American, the inner cities. So now it just came out, African-Americans and teenagers are enjoying their lowest unemployment since just after the turn of the millennium.[ cheers from crowd] Thats pretty good, right? weve eliminated burdenensome regulations at record speed and many, many more are coming off. And boy, have we put those coal miners and coal back on the map. Youve seen that, havent you? And all other forms of energy. Weve achieved a historic increase in defense spending to get our troops the support they so richly deserve. We have signed new legislation to hold federal workers accountable for the care they provide to our great, great veterans. Veterans Accountability Act, theyve been trying to get that done for many, many, many years, even decades. And you understand why it was tough, but we got it done. In fact, our secretary is with us tonight, David Shulkin, and we have some just incredible people here tonight, some of whom youve already met. But the job theyre doing for the vets, having to do with choice, having to do with doctors, having to do with not having to wait online for days and days and days and getting sicker and sicker and sicker, where you could be taken care of immediately. Now you go out and you see a doctor. To protect American jobs and workers, I withdrew the united states from both the Trans-Pacific Partnership potential disaster and the job-killing Paris Climate Accord. Believe me. And if we dont negotiate a great deal with Mexico and Canada, we will terminate NAFTA and well start all over again. You remember when I was in Youngstown, I said we will either renegotiate NAFTA or well terminate it. So lets see what happens, but were right now negotiating with the heads of Mexico, a good man, the President, and the Prime Minister of Canada, a good man. Lets see what happens. But we will no longer be the foolish people. We will no longer be the stupid people that get taken care of so badly by our politicians because they dont know what theyre doing. [cheers from crowd] We will always work with our friends and partners, but we will never again sacrifice Ohio jobs or jobs from any state in our union to enrich other countries which has been what is happening to this country. [Chants of USA] And by the way, while were on it, the Iran deal which may be the single worst deal Ive ever seen drawn by anybody, if that deal doesnt conform to what its supposed to conform to, theres going to be big, big problems for them. That I can tell you. Youre going to see that. Believe me. You would have thought when that deal was made by Secretary Kerry, maybe the worst negotiator ive ever seen, you would have thought that Iran would have said, thank you, United States. We cant believe you gave us between $100 billion and $150 billion when they were ready to fail. We cant believe you gave us $1.7 billion in cash. You know what that looks like? You would have thought they would have said, thank you, United States, we really love you very much. Instead, theyve become emboldened. That wont take place much longer. [cheers from crowd] The great president from the state of Ohio, William McKinley and you know William McKinley, does anybody know who the hell he is? Do you know who he is? William McKinley understood that when America protects our workers and our industries, we open up a higher and better destiny for our people. We dont protect our people. We dont protect. Trade comes in, goods come in. I was with Harley-Davidson, a great company from Wisconsin. Who has a Harley-Davidson? A lot of you. [Cheers from crowd] They came to the White House and they said to me, yeah, its tough going outside of the United States. Were doing great in the United States but when we sell a motorcycle to certain countries, we have as much as as a 100% tax to pay. And I said, tell me, when they sell back to us, meaning reciprocal, so when they sell back to us, what tax do we charge them? The answer is zero. [Boos from crowd] Those days are going to be over very soon. [Cheers from crowd] unfortunately, like everything else, there are so many restrictions on doing whats right for our country, theres so much red tape, but dont worry, were getting through it. The red tape, you would think we could just do it. Wouldnt you think you could say, hey, you charge us 100%, were going to charge you 100%? Then either youll get the money or youll both drop it,right? We cant do that. Weve got to go back to Congress, who other than health care today, has been made some very bad deals, okay? So were going to start enriching our country. Were going to start bringing back our jobs, and we will be fools no longer, folks. Well be fools no longer. Every single President on Mt. Rushmore  now heres what i do. Id ask whether or not you think I will some day be on Mt. Rushmore, but, but heres the problem. If I did it joking, totally joking, having fun, the fake news media will say, he believes he should be on Mt. Rushmore. So I wont say it, okay? I wont say it. But every president  theyll say it anyway tomorrow. Trump thinks he should be on Mt. Rushmore. Isnt that terrible? What a group. What a dishonest group of people, Ill tell you. [Cheers from crowd] And you know the funny thing is that you would think theyd want to see our country be great again. You would really think so. But they dont. Some day theyll explain it to me why. Every president on Mt. Rushmore believed in protecting American industry. We have to protect our industry. And now we are going to start, we are reclaiming our heritage as a manufacturing nation again. Bob Kraft, the owner of the New England patriots, I dont know if you like New England but they have a hell of a team. [Boos from crowd] Thats okay. But he came to the Oval Office and he brought a sheet with him that just came out. Manufacturing enthusiasm in the United States is at an all-time high. Isnt that great? To me thats so great. because were going to bring back our jobs,bring back our wealth, and we are going to bring back our dreams, and we are going to bring back, once again our sovereignty as a nation. As a nation. [Chants of USA from crowd] Since I took office we have cut illegal immigration on our southern border by record numbers. 78%. [Chants of build that wall from crowd] Record, record numbers. And in fact, the ICE, folks ill tell you what, and the border patrol police, they are phenomenal people. Theyre working with General Kelly. And just so you understand, weve already started fixing much of the good wall thats already there. Weve already started fixing it.but we are breaking records. And it was actually told to me the other day by somebody in Mexico thats very high up, said its incredible because their southern border is getting very little traffic. Nobody is coming anymore because they know they cant get through our southern border. So they dont even come. [Cheers from crowd] Never again will America surrender the security of our people, the safety of our communities or the sovereignty of our nation. We are cracking down hard on the foreign criminal gangs that have brought illegal drugs, violence, horrible bloodshed to peaceful neighborhoods all across our country. We are throwing MS-13 the hell out of here so fast. You know, were actually  hard to believe that were talking about our great country. We are actually liberating towns and cities. We are liberating  people are screaming from their windows, thank you, thank you to the border patrol and to General Kellys great people that come in and grab the thugs and throw them the hell out. We are liberating our towns and we are liberating our cities. Can you believe we have to do that? [Chants of build that wall wall from crowd] Earlier in year and immigration and customs enforcement conducted the largest single raid of transnational gangs in the history of our country. We are dismantling and destroying the bloodthirsty criminal gangs, and well, I will just tell you in, were not doing it in a politicly correct fashion. Were doing it rough. Our guys are rougher than their guys. I asked one of our great generals, how tough are our people? How tough are they? He said, sir, you dont want to know about it. Then I saw one guy come out, a customs officer who is a monster. I said, so general, you think i could take that guy in a fight? He said, Mr. President, sir i dont even want to think about it. I said youre right, actually. We have tough people. Our people are tougher than their people. Our people are tougher and stronger and meaner and smarter than the gangs. One by one we are finding the illegal gang members, drug dealers, thieves, robbers, criminals and killers. And we are sending them the hell back home where they came from. And once they are gone, we will never let them back in. Believe me. The predators and criminal aliens who poison our communities with drugs and prey on innocent young people, these beautiful, beautiful,innocent young people will, will find no safe haven anywhere in our country. And youve seen the stories about some of these animals. They dont want to use guns, because its too fast and its not painful enough. So theyll take a young, beautiful girl, 16, 15, and others and they slice them and dice them with a knife because they want them to go through excruciating pain before they die. And these are the animals that weve been protecting for so long. Well, theyre not being protected any longer,folks. And that is why my administration is launching a nationwide crackdown on sanctuary cities. American cities should be sanctuaries for law-abiding Americans, for people that look up to the law, for people that respect the law, not for criminals and gang members that we want the hell out of our country. [Cheers from crowd] Sanctuary cities legislation has passed the house,along with Kates Law, named for Kate Steinle, who was brutally killed by a five-time deported illegal immigrant. We are asking the Senate to vote on sanctuary cities and Kates Law legislation. Weve got to get it passed. The Trump administration has the backs of our ICE Officers, our border patrol agents. And yes, our great police officers. And we have their backs 100%. We are going to also protect them, like they protect us. This month in Chicago, there have been more than 2 homicide victims per day. What the hell is going on in Chicago? Better tell that Mayor to get tough, because its not working what theyre doing. We are going to get criminals off our streets. And we are going to make America safe again. We also strongly believe that our borders must always be closed to terrorism and extremism. We dont want radical Islamic terrorists in our country. Weve seen the total devastation in Europe. And the attack from New York to Boston to San Bernardino. Exactly one year ago next month I came right here to Youngstown to deliver a major address on how my administration would protect our country from terrorism and radical Islamic terrorism. We only want to admit those into our country who share our values, who love our people and who always will love our people. We dont want people coming into our country who have bad intentions even before they start. [Cheers from crowd] We also believe that those seeking to immigrate into our country should be able to support themselves financially and should not be able to use welfare for themselves or the household for a period of at least five years. As we speak, we are working with two wonderful senators, Tom Cotton and David Purdue, to create a new immigration system for America. Instead of todays low-skill system, just a terrible system where anybody comes in. People that have never worked, people that are criminals, anybody comes in. We want a merit-based system. One that protects workers our workers, our taxpayers, and one that protects our economy. We want it merit-based. We want people that work really hard in their country and that are going to come into our country and work really, really hard. We dont want people that come into our country and immediately go on welfare and stay there for the rest of their lives. Were not going to do it. We are working every single day to move the legislation that serves the interests of the American people. As we discussed earlier, at the very top of the list is health care reform. With Obamacare, the Washington obstructionists, meaning Democrats, made big promising to the Smerican people. And every single promise they made turned out to be a lie. I can have your doctor. You can have your plan. Do you remember? 28 times. You can have your doctor. You can have your plan. I know Democrats who heard that and they would have never have voted for it but they voted for it because they believed the lies of President Obama. For seven years every Republican running for office promised to repeal and replace in disastrous law. Now they must keep their promise. The Senate is working not only to repeal Obamacare but to deliver great health care for the American people. Any senator who votes against repeal and replace is telling America that they are fine with the Obamacare nightmare, and I predict theyll have a lot of problems. In West Virginia, recent premiums have gone up 169% since Obamacare went into effect. In Alaska over 200%. And the deductibles have gone through the roof. Youll never even get to use it. In Missouri, premiums have shot up 145% under Obamacare. In Pennsylvania the cost of Obamacare insurance has more than doubled, and the coverage has become horrific. Its time for Democrats to stop resisting. Thats their term. Resist. Resist. They have to do, finally, whats right for the American people. But probably well do it ourselves. Because today we won 51 to 50 and didnt get one Democrat vote. Think of that. [Cheers from crowd] My administration is working every single day to heed and honor the will of the voters. That includes working on one of the biggest tax cuts in American history. And actually if I get what I want it will be the single biggest tax cut in American history. We have the highest taxes anywhere in the world, and this will really bring them down to one of the lowest. And we really have no choice. We will have growth. We will have everything that weve dreamed of having. Its time to let Americans keep more of their own money. Its time to bring new companies to our shores and to create a new era of growth, prosperity and wealth. We want millions of Americans to be lifted from welfare to work and from dependence to independence. One of the ways we will put more americans to work is by rebuilding our nations crumbling infrastructure. That is why I have called on legislators to pass a bill that generates $1 trillion in new infrastructure investments. Were going to fix our roads our bridges our tunnels our airports. We are going to fix all of the things that once made us great. And we are going to use American iron, American steel, American aluminum. We will buy American and will hire, finally, American. We want once again to have the best infrastructure. The best schools, the best jobs, the best factories. And we want products that proudly carry the label made in the USA. We want this country that we love so much, America, to be strong, proud and free. Which means America must also be united. Because when America is united, America is totally unstoppable. Although Ill be totally honest with you even if its not united were unstoppable so dont worry. Were gonna to be unstoppable either way but it would be nice, wouldnt it? Our small differences are nothing compared to our common history, common values and common future. Wes hare one heart, one home and one glorious destiny. Now it is up to us to preserve the birth right of freedom and justice, the birth right of prosperity that our ancestors won for us with their sweat, with their sweat, with their blood, with their work, with their muscle, with their brain. They won it for us and were gonna make it bigger and better and stronger than it ever was before. Its time to look past the old divisions. Theyre tired, really tired, politicians. And the stale debates of the past, and to finally come together as one nation under god. We have no choice. We cannot and never will back down. We will never, ever give up. We cannot fail. And if we remember what unites us, then I promise you we will not fail. We cannot fail. We will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, god bless you, god bless the state of Ohio. Thank you everybody.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/27/donald-trump/its-false-trump-achieved-historic-increase-defense/,Economy,Polifact
5244,New York State Assembly,"Utica  The three Assemblymembers representing Herkimer County  Anthony Brindisi of Utica, Brian Miller of New Hartford, and Marc Butler of Newport say the news that a dozen beer fermentation tanks currently being transported down the Erie Canal to the Genesee Brewing Company in Rochester were made in China with nearly $10 million in State Economic Development dollars when upstate companies like Feldmeier Manufacturing Inc. in Little Falls could have done the work is deeply troubling. The fermentation tanks going down the Erie Canal are literally on a slow boat from China. It disgusts me to know that state economic development dollars were used to support a project where goods were manufactured in China, when we have companies like Feldmeier Equipment that produce products like this right in the Mohawk Valley. New York should put its money where its mouth is and support our state workers and state companies first, before they ship taxpayers money right out the door to China, Brindisi said. It simply makes no sense to export economic development dollars to China, when by definition this funding is supposed to grow jobs here in New York. New York has many long-time manufacturers like Feldmeier that are more than willing to produce quality products, and these companies deserve a chance to do business with the state, Miller said. As we struggle to improve the economy of upstate New York, I think this administration has missed a tremendous opportunity to secure employment opportunities here in Little Falls and the Mohawk Valley. Im truly disappointed that a highly regarded company like Feldmeier has been by-passed by this process, and in particular when state funding is a part of the project. We must take steps to insure that does not happen again in the Mohawk Valley or anywhere in New York State, Butler said. It is extraordinarily disappointing in light of all of the efforts my partners in government and I are putting toward keeping jobs local and invigorating the upstate economy that more effort did not go into ensuring these incentives went to Feldmeier, a company that has been in Little Falls for more than six decades, said Little Falls Mayor Mark Blask. Brindisi says the Buy New York Act (A.5510) he is sponsoring, which is supported by Miller and Butler, would require state agencies to give preference to buying goods and services produced in New York State when handing out tax dollars, as well as requiring the use of New York State iron, steel, and manufactured products for many government contracts. Enclosed is the text of the letter the three Assembly members have written on the issue to Governor Andrew Cuomo and Empire State Development President, CEO and Commissioner Howard Zemsky: Dear Governor Cuomo and Commissioner Zemsky: While it has been exciting to see the interest generated in the Erie Canal over the recent shipment of beverage tanks to the North American Brewery Facility in Rochester, the event has generated some strong concerns for us here in Herkimer County and the Mohawk Valley. As you know, the tanks were manufactured in China and then shipped here for delivery. We believe you can understand that the fanfare for this event was less than enthusiastic in the City of Little Falls, where Feldmeier Equipment, Inc., has a production facility that specializes in tanks of this nature. While there have been statements that Feldmeier did not submit a bid for the project, we are led to believe the opposite is true. In fact, we are absolutely convinced that Feldmeier submitted a proposal for the project and had asked for your support. Gentlemen, this was a $50 million project which included approximately $9.5 million in state assistance ($4.5 million in performance based Excelsior Jobs Program Tax credits and up to $5 million in Upstate Revitalization Initiative) assistance provided by the taxpayers of New York State, Herkimer County and the residents of the City of Little Falls. We feel we must express our surprise and disappointment that there were no conditions placed on the expenditure of this state funding. This project had the potential to be a great win for New York with the attention it drew to the canal, the development of additional brewing capacity for the Rochester area, and the production of the new tanks for an upstate New York Company. Feldmeier has an outstanding reputation for this kind of work and has, in fact, done other work for the Genesee Brewing Company in Rochester. As things now stand, we must express our strong disappointment that this highly-regarded local company was not given more consideration in this project. We would hope, in the future, New York companies and businesses will receive stronger support from this administration. Sincerely, Assemblyman Marc Butler Assemblyman Anthony Brindisi Assemblyman Brian Miller",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/new-york/statements/2017/jun/02/anthony-brindisi/state-money-was-not-used-buy-beer-tanks-genesee-br/,Economy,Polifact

""Thats what New Yorkers do  we work together, we grow together and we succeed together, and I commend the Mid-Hudson Valley communities for supporting each other through this hardship.

We appreciate the incredible support from Governor Cuomo, the Empire State Development Corporation, and local leaders, and we look forward to our continued partnership.

In addition, of the more than 1,200 employees affected by the fire, approximately 400 returned to work just one week after the devastating event. In the days and weeks that followed, the State worked with Gap officials to determine next steps for the company, its employees and the Fishkill community. After weighing relocation options, Gap Inc. decided to remain in New York State, building a temporary pop up facility with $2.65 million in state funding.

9641,"Transcript: Donald Trump's full remarks in Des Moines, Iowa","Donald Trump arrives to speak at Joni Ernst's Roast and Ride at the Iowa State Fairgrounds, in Des Moines, Iowa, on Aug. 27. | AP Photo Transcript: Donald Trump's full remarks in Des Moines, Iowa Donald Trump's remarks prepared for delivery at Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst's Roast and Ride in Des Moines, Iowa. Thank you. I am thrilled to be here in Iowa among so many good friends. Story Continued Below Iowa is fortunate to have some of the best and most dedicated public servants in the country  including Governor Terry Branstad, Lt. Governor Kim Reynolds, State GOP Chairman Jeff Kauffman, Senator Chuck Grassley and, of course, our great host, Senator Joni Ernst. What an incredible roster. I also want to take a moment to thank the Bikers who have been so good to me throughout this campaign. I cant tell you how much it means to me. They are fantastic people who truly love our country. More than anything, today, I want to express my gratitude to our amazing Veterans. We will not let you down. Together, we are going to win this state in November  and we are going to win the White House for the American people. The White House will become the Peoples House. We will tackle and fix the problems that have gone unsolved for years: failing schools, crumbling infrastructure, broken borders, bloated bureaucracy, wasteful spending, and a government that just doesnt work. This is a campaign about big ideas designed to help everyday people. These are the people who work hard but who dont have a voice. Its also a campaign about restoring honesty and accountability to government service. The whole world has been shocked by the continuing revelations regarding Hillary Clinton and her pay-for-play State Department. Now it was just announced that her important calendar records will not be released to the public until after the election  more protection from a corrupt government. As Ive said many times in recent days, its hard to tell where the Clinton Foundation ends, and where the State Department begins. The Clinton Corruption scandals have been a sad time for America. The illegal server, the foreign hacking, the deleted emails, the secret schedules, the lying to Congress. Its all just too much. How much more can voters take? Hillary Clinton thinks shes entitled to be President  she thinks that shes above the law. But the truth is the opposite: her criminal conduct at home, and her failed interventions overseas, simply make her unfit to serve in the Oval Office. I believe America is ready to turn the page on this sordid past. We dont want another 4 years of Obama or Clinton Controversies: theyre not only dangerous but, frankly, exhausting to the people. How do you even keep up with them all? The Clintons have had their time on the stage but now its time to close that chapter in the history book and open a new one. That is why this is such an exciting year to be a Republican, and to vote Republican. This year, the GOP is offering the voters a chance to break-up the corrupt establishment and to create a New American Future. This chance will never come again. The Big Banks and Wall Street donors who want nothing to change are throwing millions and millions at my opponent. These are the same people who paid Bill and Hillary Clinton $150 million for speeches. Hillary Clintons campaign is all about protecting the powerful. Our campaign is about protecting those who have no power. Together, we are going to give working people a voice for the first time in a very, very long time. Lets talk about what that means. For our Veterans, it means a guarantee that they can seek medical care at either a VA facility or at a private medical doctor. Never again will we allow a Veteran to die waiting for the care they need. We will protect those who protect us. At the center of our change agenda is also a plan to fix our rigged economy. The government just revised the growth numbers for last quarter down again  its now only 1.1 percent. Thats not just bad, its catastrophic. Were going to Make America Grow Again. That begins with supporting our family farms right here in Iowa. Family farms are the backbone of this country. We are going to end the EPA intrusion into your family homes and your family farms. We are going to protect the Renewable Fuel Standard, eliminate job-killing regulations like the Waters of the U.S. rule, and provide desperately-needed tax relief. Almost 97% of farms in this country are family-owned and family-managed. Its not only a great American tradition, but a vital component of Americas economic and national security. Yet, Hillary Clinton wants to shut down family farms just like she wants to shut down the mines and the steelworkers. She will do this not only through radical regulation, but also by raising taxes on family farms  and all businesses  to rates as high as nearly 50 percent. Adding to the pain, she will tax family farms again at death by as much as 45 percent. On top of that, her anti-energy agenda will drive up the cost of energy  another attack on agriculture. We are going to end this war on the American farmer. That includes our plan to lower the tax rate on family farms down to 15 percent, and to stop the double-taxation of family farms at death  helping to ensure that the family farm tradition in Iowa continues to thrive and flourish. My economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs, jobs, jobs. I am asking for the support of all Americans who want more opportunity, higher wages, safe communities, competent leadership, and honest government. We are going to send the special interests packing, and we are going to once again have a government of, by, and for the people. Republicans are the Party of Lincoln. Which brings me to a subject that is so important and personal for me. Nothing means more to me than working to make our party the home of the African-American vote once again. There are millions of African-Americans in this country who have succeeded so greatly and who deserve a government that protects and honors their incredible contribution. But we also have to talk about the millions of African-Americans who remain trapped in poverty and failing schools. Ive spoken a lot in recent days about the deplorable conditions in many of our inner cities. As a father, as a builder, as an American, it offends my sense of right and wrong to see anyone living in such conditions. Almost 40 percent of African-American children are living in poverty  including 45 percent of children under the age of six. In Detroit, half of its residents do not work. In Milwaukee, almost 4 in 10 African-American men between the age of 24-54 are not employed. More than 6,000 African-Americans are the victims of murder every year. Just yesterday, the cousin of NBA star Dwayne Wade was the victim of a tragic shooting in Chicago. She was the mother of 4, and was killed while pushing her infant child in a stroller. It breaks our hearts. This shouldnt happen in America. We send our thoughts and our prayers to the family, and we also promise to fight for a better tomorrow. Across Chicago, more than 2,700 have been shooting victims since January of this year. We cannot, as a society, tolerate this level of violence and suffering in our own cities. Those who would deny that this is a national crisis  a crisis requiring urgent action  have no business running for elected office. Failed Democratic policies  the policies of Hillary Clinton  have created this high crime and crushing poverty. In so many communities under Democratic control, we have bad schools, no jobs, high crime, and no hope. It cant get any worse. To those suffering, I say: vote for Donald Trump and I will fix it. What do you have to lose? Let me also tell you what you have to gain: millions of jobs, better schools and safe communities. By the way, how quickly people have forgotten that Hillary Clinton called black youth super-predators, and how insulted they were. I am running to offer a better future  to the citizens of Detroit, Baltimore, Chicago, and all across this great land. African-Americans have given so much to this country. Theyve fought and died in every war since the Revolution. Theyve lifted up the conscience of our nation in the Civil Rights movement. Theyve sacrificed so much for the national good. Now is the time to put a new agenda into action that expands opportunity, ensures equality, and that protects the rights of each and every citizen. This includes one of the most important rights of all: the right to live in safety. I will work with communities, with police, and with federal law enforcement, to make communities safe and secure for all of our people. We are also going to end the discrimination that traps parents and kids in failing government schools. The Republican Party is the Party of School Choice. There is another civil rights issue we need to talk about, and thats the issue of immigration enforcement. Every time an African-American citizen, or any citizen, loses their job to an illegal immigrant, the rights of that American citizen have been violated. Equal protection under the law must include the consistent application of our immigration laws. These laws were passed to protect American citizens and lawful residents. For instance, federal law protects the ability of American workers to seek jobs and employment. When government suspends those immigration laws in order to curry favor with special interests  costing Americans their jobs  they have been denied the protection of their laws. In recent days, the media  as it usually does  has missed the whole point on immigration. All the media wants to talk about is the 11 million or more people here illegally. But my priority is the well-being of 300 million American citizens, including millions of Hispanic citizens and legal residents who want a secure border, a safe and drug-free community, and a growing economy. My goal is to provide good jobs, good schools, and safety to every Hispanic community in the country. But we cant do that if we dont secure our border. On Day One, I am going to begin swiftly removing criminal illegal immigrants from this country  including removing the hundreds of thousands of criminal illegal immigrants that have been released into U.S. communities under the Obama-Clinton Administration. These international gangs and cartels will be a thing of the past. Their reign of terror will be over. In this task, we will always err on the side of protecting the American people  we will use immigration law to prevent crimes, and will not wait until some innocent American has been harmed or killed before taking action. I am going to build a great border wall, institute nationwide e-verify, stop illegal immigrants from accessing welfare and entitlements, and develop an exit-entry tracking system to ensure those who overstay their visas are quickly removed. If we dont enforce visa expiration dates, then we have an open border  its as simple as that. I am also going to cancel all unconstitutional executive orders and empower rank-and-file ICE officers and Border Patrol officers to finally do the jobs they were hired for. Now, what is Hillary Clinton going to do? She has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, combined with the elimination of virtually all routine immigration enforcement. In other words, totally open borders. Which will lead to a massive crime wave. Most alarmingly, she has pledged to keep President Obamas executive amnesty  which has been blocked by the Supreme Court  directly disregarding a Supreme Court injunction. Beyond that, she has pledged to add another executive amnesty in violation of both Congressional law and the U.S. Constitution. These actions from Hillary Clinton will trigger one of the greatest Constitutional crisis in American history. In effect, she is pledging to abolish the law-making powers of Congress and assume the powers of an imperial ruler. This executive amnesty would bypass Congress to print millions of work permits and benefit cards to those ineligible to receive them. Hillary Clintons immigration proposal will also give illegal immigrants access to Obamacare, Social Security, Medicare and all U.S. welfare. Her plan will functionally end enforcement of visa overstays rules, another open border decree. She will also close down detention centers for border-crossers, meaning we will have an open southern border as well. This is not to mention that Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. She cant even say the words: Radical Islamic Terrorism. And she supports the Sanctuary City and catch-and-release policies that are getting innocent Americans killed. Ive met with many of these grieving families, including the incredible family of Sarah Root, a young Iowa girl who was killed by an illegal immigrant released from the border by the Obama Administration  and then released again after the killing. Ive been so inspired by the courage and bravery of the Root Family and Id like to invite them on the stage right now just to say a few words. Thank you. There is a reason why 16,500 Border Patrol agents have endorsed our campaign, and warned that Hillary Clintons plan is deeply dangerous divisive radical reckless wrecking innocent lives panders to extremists and would create unprecedented crisis So the choice couldnt be more clear. A vote for Trump is a vote to have a nation of laws, a vote for Clinton is a vote for open borders. On every issue, our campaign is about making life better for working people. But we cant accomplish that goal unless we break-up the special interest monopoly and give power back to the citizens. Many people have said that establishment media assault on me and our campaign  we have a movement  is the greatest in the political history of our country. Even today, some major papers fail to mention how strong our poll numbers have become over the short one-week period  they just refuse to print anything positive or good. They too are part of the rigged system trying to deny people the positive change they deserve. They take phrases and statements, chop them up, take them out of context, and discuss them for days. Always trying to demean and belittle me and our incredible movement to take our country back from the death spiral it is currently in. Imagine if this much media attention was spent telling the truth about the real problems facing America. Imagine if the media spent this much time telling the story of Sarah Root. All of the ugly things being said by Hillary Clinton in recent days  funded by big banks and Wall Street donors  are nothing more than a desperate attempt by failed leaders to cling to power in order to keep rigging the system. There is nothing they wont say or do, no lie they wont tell  and no amount of money they wont spend  to try to bully voters into giving them what they want. This November 8th, the American people are going to reject the cynicism of the past and embrace the optimism of the future. The old attacks arent going to work anymore. The Clinton-Kaine fear-mongering isnt going to resonate with anyone but the most radical factions of their far-left base. I want to empower people. Hillary Clinton wants to scare people. Empowering people begins with three simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs. Our economy will soar. Wages will rise. We will make new friends abroad, and achieve new peace at home. We will be a country of laws, and a country of great success. Our cities will be safe, sound and secure. Our government will be honest, ethical and responsive. Rule by special interests will be over. The rule of the American people will begin. So lets get out and vote on November 8th, and create the future our children deserve. Together, We Will Make America Strong Again. We Will Make American Wealthy Again. We Will Make America United Again. We Will Make America Safe Again. And We Will Make America Great Again  For Everyone.

11666,"Wendy Davis And Trapped Director Dawn Porter Talk Abortion, Television, And Daviss Political Future","There are people you expect to see all over SXSW: Andrew W.K., or Big Boi, or the cast of Silicon Valley. One of the people you might not expect to be a regular presence at the tech/film/music mega-conference, though, is former Texas State Senator Wendy Davis. But Davis is everywhere at SXSW this year. Shes been at screenings of Dawn Porters abortion law documentary Trapped; she spoke at the online harassment summit organized for Saturday; shes appearing on Monday at SXGood to announce a new project, Deeds Not Words; and shes going to speak at Tumblrs 79 Party on Wednesday evening, intended to celebrate womens voices. Thats a lot of SXSW appearances for anybody, let alone a former state senator whose last public move was a failed gubernatorial campaign. But Daviswho came to fame for her 2013 filibuster of the Texas abortion law, a story thats told (among others) in Trappedis readying her second act. Texas Monthly caught up with Davis and Porter to talk about abortion, her next moves, and what she says to women who want to take a picture with her. Texas Monthly: Whats the reaction been like to the film so far? Dawn Porter: The film premiered at Sundance, and the most surprising reaction from that audience was how emotional people are. One in three American women have an abortion, but theres so much shame and stigma that theres not an opportunity to speak about that experience. A number of people have said that after watching it, they felt like they werent alone. They were feeling a little bit of grief, but not regretting their decisions, and just that feeling of feeling supported by women. Here, its very interesting: People are so much more in tune to the law, so here people are not shocked by whats happening. I think what the audience here appreciates is seeing some of the people who are standing up for them. Out in the rest of the country, people are not aware of whats happening here with HB2, or really across the country. Here, theres a lot more like, Yeah, finally someones putting things together, and then tying it to the rest of the country. Texas Monthly: In addition to appearing with Trapped, theres a big Wendy Davis presence at SXSW this year: the movie, the panel on online harassment, the speech at SXGood, and youre appearing at Tumblrs party during SXSW Music, too. What do you have going on that makes having a big presence at SXSW worth doing? Wendy Davis: Im continuing to be a voice, as I can, for womennot just for reproductive autonomy and all that that signifies for womens ability to equalize opportunity in this world, but equal opportunity on a number of levels for women, which of course includes a myriad of issues that have yet to be addressed in the United States. Theres a lot of great work being done and Ive been proud to be a part of trying to advance to that. Texas Monthly: What other issues are you thinking about besides reproductive autonomy? Wendy Davis: Of course, equal pay. You may recall that I, along with the amazing Senfronia Thompson in the Texas House, was successful in passing an equal pay bill here, which was no easy featonly to have it vetoed by Governor Perry. So Texas is one of only a handful of states that does not have an equal pay law. Even the law that exists at the federal level needs some punch. We need a better mechanism for proactively addressing companies self-examining and bringing pay levels up, much like weve seen happen in Great Britain, for example, where companies are required to publicly report their pay scales. As a consequence of that, theyve done a lot of self-reflection and many didnt really realize the implicit bias in their pay structure, so things like that. Family leave, of course, very important. But for me, empowering girlsand I say girls purposefully, young girls from the very smallest of ages to not be socialized in ways that treat us to be other than the very equals that we are. Thats important and my work going forward is primarily going to be focused around young women on helping to move this incredibly passionate group of millennial women to some constructive action, because I get asked often by women who want to make a difference, How do I do it? What do I do? So were putting together an initiative thats going to help put some real concrete action steps in place for young women to take advantage of. Texas Monthly: The filibuster was in 2013, and things move fast in politics and in media, but you still clearly have a constituency among the people who came to recognize you then. When you do the Lenny Letter, people want to read what you say. When youre at SXSW, people want to come see you. Does it surprise you that you to still have this audience thats hungry to hear what you have to say? Do you see that as an opportunity, or a responsibility? Wendy Davis: I see it as both. All. All of the above. Its surprising to me, yes, and incredibly humbling and I feel so honored by it. Every now and then when someone asks to take a photo with me and they apologize for asking, I tell them I thought that the moment my gubernatorial campaign was behind me no one would want to take a photo with me again, so its an honor. I feel this incredible responsibility to young women and I see how hungry young women are for female role models in the world. I have been blessed with the opportunity to be one of those, and I take that responsibility very seriously and I want to make sure that I use that opportunity as productively as possible. Dawn Porter: We didnt interview Senator Davis for the film, really because as a style choice we wanted to stay in the moment and really use what she did on the floor at the Texas State Capitol as a starting-off point for the political conversation. So when the film was done and we knew we were coming to SXSW, we reached out to her and she immediately said yes, and has been incredibly generous with her time for some random documentary people who called up to say, Hey, can you come spend days with us? Her voice is so important and I think there is a hunger for people to have a voice. I think women in particular are feeling like we are being drowned out, and to have her here is incredibly important for us. Texas Monthly: This is a movie that is very unapologetically talking about abortion and abortion providers. Its very much on their side. During your campaign, the word abortion didnt come out a lot. It was language like womens health, and things like that. Im curious if youre more comfortable now just being involved with someone who really is very explicit is talking about abortion with a capital A. Wendy Davis: One of the most extraordinary things about not being in public office anymore is the freedom of no longer being constrained by message management. No matter whether I run for office, or have the ability to hold office again in the future, I will never allow myself to be message-managed again. I think its unbelievably important that we de-stigmatize abortion. We cant hide and pretend that thats not what were fighting for. That is a very important part of what were fighting foralong with a host of other reproductive rights. I feel a responsibility that I make sure to continue to speak up and out about that, and give other women the freedom to feel like they can do so as well. Because as Dawn said, one of the reasons that we are where we are on this issue is that these very real, human stories. The unbelievable devastation and the impact of laws like this arent necessarily known because its a topic that people feel is taboo, and they dont talk about it in their community conversations, and what Dawns done is really to help illuminate that. I hope it prompts a broader conversation that more of us feel comfortable talking openly and without any shame whatsoever about abortion and why its important to protect that constitutional right. Texas Monthly: When you opposed HB2, you and your colleagues made arguments about the purpose of the law that ultimately didnt affect anyones vote when it passed. When the Supreme Court heard arguments last week, justices like Kagan and Ginsburg made similar points, but this time, the people who support the law have to answer them. Whats it like for you, as someone who was saying those things almost three years ago, to see those arguments made in a way that has more consequence? Wendy Davis: It makes me so grateful for the fact that we have a three-branch system of government. Really that is what the courts are there for, to keep us in compliance with our constitutionally-held values. As a lawyer, it was very important to me, and I know for others on the Senate and the House floor during those debates, to make sure that we set the legal stage to empower this argument as strongly as possible. We knew that we werent going to change any minds in terms of the bills author and the supporters of the bill, but pinning them to the wall, forcing them to admit that they essentially had absolutely no objective, rational evidence that somehow supported the argument that these laws would make womens health better, it was important for us to build that record. Because we knew that day would come, and Im so grateful and thankful for the justice system and how it works, and the fact that we have had our day in court and that weve been able to really make those points in a very clear and profound way. Dawn Porter: Im actually a lawyer also and I cant underscore how critical that record is. I think what you have seen in the evolution in this argument and what you saw at the Supreme Court, is that the people challenging the law do not have to ask the Supreme Court to make new law. You can abide by the undue burden standard, because of the record that was created in the states. So saying, were not asking you to create a new legal standard, we are asking you to uphold the one that you have adhered to for the last several decades. Legally, this should be an easy case before the Supreme Court. Its whether or not the politics can actually overcome the law. I think were at a real tipping point in our culture of politics. Its going to be a really important test of our justice system. Texas Monthly: There are so many different groups of people who are fighting this battle: youve got documentarians, youve got doctors who are providing the abortions, youve got support staff who are running these facilities, youve got politicians who are fighting in state houses. How does all that come together? Dawn Porter: Eighty percent of Americans, if you ask them, believe that abortion should be legal and should be accessible. Theres a range of opinions on that, but the overwhelming majority of Americans believe in the right to an abortion. What I think is happening is a number of us are too silent about that, so part of the effort to use media is to say whatever you believe, use your voice. We all tell our toddlers, Use your words. This is a use your words momentif you are complacent, the loudest voices in the choir will win and those results will be devastating. This movie is certainly about abortion as an issue, and womens rights as an issue, and its also about our political system that would allow a small minority to dictate to the rest of us. I hope between brave lawyers, people willing to speak up, and people willing to tell their stories, that that will motivate others to be active. Texas Monthly: Youve got Wendy Davis here, whos obviously someone that people associate with this issue. When you make a movie like this and you get to introduce people to someone like Willie Parker, is that interesting to you? Dawn Porter: As a filmmaker youre attracted to people because you see something in them. What I love about my job so much is giving other people the opportunity to see what I saw. Doctor Parker was speaking and had somewhat of a public persona. Whats really thrilling is to see people that dont think of themselves as extraordinary and, I hope, helping them to see that the clinic owners, their work, is the living embodiment of our democratic system. Its I have rights because they are there. I know that certainly after these screenings, they have said they didnt see themselves that way and Im glad that now they do. Texas Monthly: Is it important to lend the stature that you have as the senator who filibustered the bill to help these people see themselves that way? Wendy Davis: What happened here in Texas was a profound and important day, and Ive had the opportunity to continue to speak up about reproductive rights, but what the folks who are highlighted in that movie are doing is the real workthe hard work of fighting day after day after day after day for adequate healthcare for the people that come to their clinics and to fight against the barrage of laws that try in every way possible to shut them down. Their dedication to human beings and the care and concern that they have for them is profound, and I was deeply touched watching the film last night to see the way that Dawn put an incredibly face on the work that they do and the value that they provide. They truly are the unsung heroes, and Im glad that theres a film out there that will help people to see that. Texas Monthly: Were at SXSW, which is music, film and entertainment, and I know you had some things in the works on television. Im curious, hows that going? Wendy Davis: Its kind of stalled for now. NBC did not move it forward to its upcoming pilot season, so the producer of the show and the writer of the show are shopping other networks right now. Texas Monthly: What was the process of developing that like for you? Wendy Davis: Interesting. I really enjoyed helping to write the script for the pilot, because it gave me an opportunity to give some light to a lot of these political issues that we deal with in Texas. I think thats whats so important about a show like that and why Im hopeful still that well find a home for it is because shining a light on the impact of some of the lawmaking thats occurring in places like Texas is really, really important. I think a lot of people in the public dont know whats happening and they dont understand how corrupting it is to our shared values. Texas Monthly: What specific role did you play in the writing? Did you have Final Draft open? Wendy Davis: I helped to create the storyline, is the best way to say it. After that, the writer would put together that story, give my perspective on whether it was being accurately portrayed, and some suggestions on how to make some changes to achieve that.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2016/may/27/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-wrongly-says-texas-among-states-no-equ/,Economy,Polifact

12186,North Carolina Becomes Ninth State with 10 Million Population,"By adding an average of 281 people per day during the last year, North Carolinas population crossed the 10 million mark, making the state the ninth in that category, according to U.S. Census Bureau state population estimates released today. North Carolinas population gain over the July 1, 2014, to July 1, 2015, period ranked it behind only Texas, Florida, California, Georgia and Washington. Notably, Florida added more people than California for the first time in nearly a decade. Floridas gain of 365,703 people also pushed it past 20 million, becoming the third state to reach that milestone. California continued to be the most populous state on July 1, 2015, with 39.1 million, followed by Texas with 27.5 million. North Dakota was the nations fastest-growing state or equivalent over the last year, for the fourth year in a row. Its population increased 2.3 percent, followed by 1.9 percent growth in Colorado, the District of Columbia and Nevada. Each of the 10 fastest-growing states was in the South or West with the exception of North Dakota. Seven states lost population between July 1, 2014, and July 1, 2015: Illinois (22,194 or -0.17 percent), West Virginia (4,623 or -0.25 percent), Connecticut (3,876 or -0.11 percent), Mississippi (1,110 or -0.04 percent), Maine (928 or -0.07 percent), Vermont (725 or -0.12 percent) and New Mexico (458 or -0.02 percent). The United States as a whole saw its population increase by 0.79 percent over the period to 321.4 million, slightly faster than the rate of growth over the previous one-year period (0.78 percent). In addition to the 50 states and the District of Columbia, the new statistics also include estimates for Puerto Rico. On July 1, 2015, Puerto Rico had an estimated population of 3.5 million, a decline of 60,706, or 1.7 percent, from one year earlier. The Census Bureau produces population estimates each year, allowing the public to gauge the growth and demographic composition of the nation, states and communities. These statistics use administrative data to estimate population change between census years, using the decennial census count as a starting point. Local governments use estimates to locate services, and the private sector uses them to locate businesses. The Census Bureau also released today estimates of the number of people 18 and older in the U.S., states and Puerto Rico. The downloadable file also includes total population and the percentage of people 18 and older. In 2015, there were 247.8 million voting-age residents in the U.S., comprising 77.1 percent of the nations population. Internet address: www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/data-sets.html. During 2016, the Census Bureau will release estimates of the 2015 population of counties, cities and towns, and metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas as well as national, state and county population estimates by age, sex, race and Hispanic origin.

13203,One step up and two steps back,"With the release of the  triennial Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) from the Federal Reserve, it is once again time to look at trends in wealth. The SCF is one of the best sources for data on net worth (assets minus liabilities) in the U.S. In this post I use the newly released 2013 data to update my previous posts that looked at wealth trends using the 2007 and 2010 SCFs. The figure below reports changes in wealth for two periods. First, the purple bars are a repeat of the post on the 2010 SCF which reported changes in wealth from 2007-10. That period happened to coincide with the Great Recession. So, the first purple bar reflects the effects of the bursting of the housing bubble and financial debacle followed by the Great Recession, which caused typical families to lose about two-fifths of their total wealth. The middle purple bar reports the change in cumulative wealth of those on the Forbes 400 list. Forbes estimates the net worth of the 400 wealthiest Americans, and it turns out these folks  heavily invested in the stock market, real estate and myriad other financial assets  also lost ground during the recession (-16%). Finally, the third purple bar breaks out the Walton 6 listed on the Forbes 400. They fared pretty well over the Great Recession as their wealth was up 22% from 2007-10. At the time the companys then-CFO rightly stated that tough times are actually a good time for Wal-Mart. I turn now to the green bars in the figure. These represent just-released 2013 data and reflect changes in wealth from 2010-13. Unfortunately, even as the recession is officially far behind us (it ended in June 2009); the benefits of economic growth have yet to reach typical families as they lost another 2% of wealth over this period. Typical family wealth in 2013 was $81,200  which is about the same as it was in 1992 at $80,200 (all figures in this post are in 2013 dollars). But things are really looking up for the wealthiest among us, as those on the Forbes 400 saw a 45% rebound in their wealth during 2010-13 and the subset of Walton wealth increased by just over half (51%). The cumulative wealth of the Forbes 400 was about $2.1 trillion, or roughly the same as that held by the entire bottom 60% of American families. The combined worth of the Walton 6 was $145 billion in 2013  which equaled the total wealth of the entire bottom 43%. On this side of the Great Recession, after much discussion of inequality, it looks like it is going to be more of the same  typical workers and their families, who paid the price during the downturn, have gained little during the upturn.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2016/mar/14/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-says-walmart-heirs-are-wealthier-bo/,Economy,Polifact
13352,"Transcript of the Democratic Presidential Debate in Flint, Mich."," In 1963, and an important day for me, I went to the march on Washington led by Dr. King for jobs and freedom. Dr. King has been an important inspiration for me. In this campaign, if you go toberniesanders.com and read our position on criminal justice, it is I believe the strongest position of any candidate. What it says among other things, 51 percent of African-American kids today are unemployed  you know were going to do? Were going to provide education and jobs for those kids, not jails or incarceration. COOPER: In a speech about policing, the FBI director borrowed a phrase from Avenue Q saying, everybody is a little racist. So on a personal front, what racial blind spots do you have? CLINTON: Let me go answer Mr. Mcghees question because I think its a profound one. I think the most important that happened to me was a combination of my church and youth minister when I was a teenager, insisting that we go in to inner-city Chicago because I lived in a suburb and have exchanges with kids in black and hispanic churches. It was also important for me to be a baby-sitter for the children of migrant workers and to learn more about their lives, and to hear Dr. King speak in Chicago when I was about 14 years old. That got me thinking about what I needed to do to try to fulfill my faith. When I was in law school, I had the opportunity to mead a visionary woman, named Mary Right Adelman, who worked with Dr. King who was the first African-American woman who passed the Mississippi bar. I asked her for a job and she said she didnt have any money. I was working my way through law school and she said if I could get a job and get myself paid, she would give me a job. So I got law students a Civil Rights Research Council Grant. The first thing she did was send me to look at South Carolina, to investigate juveniles being sent to adult jails. The second thing she did was to send me to Alabama to investigate segregated academies. So from that moment until today, I am so grateful for my experiences as a very young woman driven by my church and my experiences working for the Childrens Defense Fund which have given me some insight and have lit a fire inside me to do everything I can to address systemic racism. LEMON: I want to ask both of you this question. I appreciate you responding to that question, but I want to ask both of you again. In a speech about policing, the FBI director James Comey borrowed a phrase saying, everyone is a little bit racist. What racial blind spot do you have? Secretary, you first.CLINTON: Well, Don, if I could, I think being a white person in the United States of America, I know that I have never had the experience that so many people, the people in this audience have had. And I think its incumbent upon me and what I have been trying to talk about during this campaign is to urge white people to think about what it is like to have the talk with your kids, scared that your sons or daughters, even, could get in trouble for no good reason whatsoever like Sandra Bland and end up dead in a jail in Texas.  CLINTON: And I have spent a lot of time with the mothers of African-American children who have lost them, Trayvon Martins mother. And Ive gotten to know them. Ive listened to them. And it has been incredibly humbling because I cant pretend to have the experience that you have had and others have had. But I will do everything that I possibly can to not only do the best to understand and to empathize, but to tear down the barriers of systemic racism that are in the criminal justice system, in the employment system, in the education and health care system. That is what I will try to do to deal with what I know is the racism that still stalks our country.

13897,Raimondo details Rhode Island's pitch to GE,"Began with 7 a.m. phone call, included private dinner at Bacaro  before company opted for Boston PROVIDENCE, R.I.  Governor Raimondo offered details Tuesday about how Rhode Island worked its way onto General Electric's radar as the company sought a new headquarters, how she traveled to Fairfield, Conn., last July for a meeting and then how the Ocean State stayed in the running with an economic incentives package ""over $100 million,"" which was ""competitive"" with the $145 million in subsidies the company ultimately got to move to Boston. The state offered Rebuild Rhode Island and Qualified Jobs Incentive tax credits and a tax-increment financing district, Raimondo said. But she offered no details about the source of that much money. It's difficult to say exactly how much is available from current state incentives. GE whittled its list from 30 locations to Boston, New York City and Providence, Raimondo said. Now, she remains ""very much in talks with them"" about possibly bringing back-office or information-technology jobs here, or, ""It could be an innovation center."" During a meeting with a group of reporters, Raimondo released what she said was her first presentation to GE. The governor stressed ongoing state efforts to create a more predictable tax and business climate, skilled workers from Brown University's data science and computer science programs and the Rhode Island School of Design, pension reform, plus the state's optimal location between Boston and New York, good quality of life and lower cost-of-living. Raimondo's pitch began with a 7 a.m. Saturday phone call to a member of General Electric's board of directors, Douglas Alexander Warner III, with whom Raimondo serves on the Yale Corporation, her law school's governing board: ""I said, 'Hey, I want to put my hat in the ring. We've got a lot going on.' "" That led to a call with Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey S. Bornstein, then Chairman and CEO Jeffrey R. Immelt: ""And I said, 'Just let us compete.' "" At first, GE executives questioned, ""Rhode Island?!"" Raimondo said. Yet they knew of the state's pension-reform efforts, which she led as state treasurer. The state's pitch included a private dinner with GE executives at the Italian restaurant Bacaro on South Water Street. They met when the restaurant was closed to keep the talks quiet. Guests included Hasbro CEO Brian Goldner, two to three other CEOs, presidents of the University of Rhode Island, Brown and RISD, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed and Providence Mayor Jorge O. Elorza, who ""stopped by."" When she took the call that the company wanted a bigger city, Raimondo said she was ""disappointed."" But overall, ""I was thrilled. When we started this ...

14908,Boehner: House Republicans for responsible energy,"American energy policy needs to be more responsive and less onerous A gas pipeline riser on private property in Reno, Texas. (Photo: Michael Mulvey for USA TODAY) One thing I learned running a small business is that you have to play to your strengths. Our economy has its challenges, but America is at the forefront of an energy boom. We have more combined oil, coal and natural gas resources than any other nation on Earth. That's why, every day, Republicans are working on a true all-of-the-above energy agenda that will help lower costs, create jobs, strengthen our allies and make us a nation of builders again. Such a strategy has the potential to usher in a new era of American leadership and prosperity  but we can't do it alone. President Obama says he supports all of the above, but his actions prove the opposite. Just consider his plan to impose excessive new EPA regulations on power plants  what amounts to a national energy tax. It will have Americans asking, ""Where are the jobs?"" for years while their bills go up, electric grid reliability is compromised, and energy-intensive sectors like manufacturing take on even more water. The president is so out of touch that he won't even approve the popular Keystone XL pipeline. As for his party's leaders in the Senate, they also talk a big game about energy only to block our most common-sense solutions. Here are some examples: The House has acted to prevent duplicative federal regulations on hydraulic fracturing, which has lowered unemployment in states that have safely and effectively regulated this type of energy production. And we have pressed the president to open more areas to exploration and production, and cut back red tape on new energy projects. We'll continue that effort this summer with legislation to reduce permitting delays for new factories  making it easier to plan, invest and revitalize manufacturing. America has the resources to become an energy superpower, but we need the right infrastructure in place to get there. Thanks to technological advancements, natural gas production on state and private lands is up 33% and oil is up 61% since 2009. That energy boom, however, is being throttled by a pipeline system that has not kept pace with our changing energy landscape. The House has voted to expedite the approval of new pipelines, and will soon advance additional legislation to create a more efficient process for cross-border pipeline approvals and prevent another debacle like we've seen with the Keystone pipeline. The nearly six-year delay in approving Keystone is costing Americans more than 100,000 jobs and nearly a million barrels of oil a day, and forcing our most important trading partner to look to China for new energy markets. The House passed a bill last year that would green-light the project immediately, creating jobs and reducing our dependence on unstable energy sources. But the president and Senate Democrats remain opposed. Advancing our energy independence is imperative for our economic and national security, and for that of our allies. Just last week, Russia announced it was cutting off natural gas exports to Ukraine, which is also the transit route for 15% of Europe's natural gas. The House has voted to give the president the tools he needs to counter Vladimir Putin's aggression, but we must do more to break Russia's energy stranglehold on Europe. With a backlog of 26 liquefied natural gas export applications pending, the House will act where the administration has not and move a bill to expedite the approval of more LNG exports. Doing so will not only strengthen our international partners, it will help create jobs and promote energy production here at home. In addition to all this, we've also passed legislation to prevent that national energy tax from taking effect without congressional approval, while advancing several other bills aimed at stopping regulations targeting coal-fired electricity. And because a true all-of-the-above policy requires us not only to harness the resources we have, but to use them wisely, we have passed bipartisan, common-sense legislation to promote increased energy efficiency. The president has no more elections to win, yet he allows the narrow interests of his most extreme political allies to dictate an agenda that puts jobs and opportunity out of reach for middle-class families. While he's writing America's energy workers off, we're trying to give them the tools they need to succeed. That's how we play to our strengths, and that's how America can win against significant global competition. Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, is speaker of the house.

But it would also shut down plants and potentially put an average of 224,000 more people out of work every year.

17640,"Inequality, exhibit A: Walmart and the wealth of American families","Two weeks ago saw the 50th anniversary of the opening of the first Walmart. And just a week before that, the Federal Reserve released the underlying data on family wealth from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). The SCF is the survey that reported the median wealth of American families (that is, the wealth of that American family that is exactly wealthier than half of all families and less wealthy than half) fell by 38.8 percent between 2007 and 2010. We have argued previously that Walmart is a useful archetype for trends in the larger American economy over the past three decades. Its enormous size and bargaining power has led to fabulous wealth for its owners (most notably the Walton family), while the compensation it pays its employees is generally low, even by retail standards; and the ubiquity of Walmart stores means that it is effectively the marginal employer in many U.S. counties. And its role as this marginal employer often serves to drive down workers wages county-wide. The three years of wealth data from 2007 to 2010 just provides an extreme example of how the economic fortunes of Walmarts owners have diverged from those of typical American households. Concretely, between 2007 and 2010, while median family wealth fell by 38.8 percent, the wealth of the Walton family members rose from $73.3 billion to $89.5 billion (note that the 2007 wealth number is slightly larger than was reported at the timeto provide an inflation-adjusted comparison, I converted the 2007 wealth value of $69.7 billion to 2010 dollars using the consumer price index (the CPI-U-RS, to be specific)). In 2007, it was reported that the Walton family wealth was as large as the bottom 35 million families in the wealth distribution combined, or 30.5 percent of all American families. And in 2010, as the Waltons wealth has risen and most other Americans wealth declined, it is now the case that the Walton family wealth is as large as the bottom 48.8 million families in the wealth distribution (constituting 41.5 percent of all American families) combined. Its hardly a surprise that the economic circumstances of the Walton family and that of most Americans are moving in opposite directions, but some have attempted to quibble with the use of this particular statistic by noting that nearly 13 million American families have negative net worthmeaning that they have outstanding debts greater than the value of their assets. This is a bit of a strange objectionof course, many American families have negative net worth, but this is an economic reality, not a statistical fluke. Its true that some of these negative net worth families are not necessarily families that are economically struggling: take a 27-year-old recent graduate of Harvard Medical School who has enormous student loan debt, but also has 40 or 50 or 60 years of very high earnings potential in front of them. However, its probably a safe guess that negative net-worth families that are actually very well-placed economically are a rare exception, and not the rule. And increasingly, many of these negative net-worth families are people who find themselves underwater in the wake of the housing bubbles burstas can be inferred in the large increase in the share of families reporting negative net worth between 2007 and 2010 (negative net-worth families rose from roughly 7.7 percent of the total in 2011 to 11 percent in 2011). But still, these critics charge, the Walton wealth comparison is unfair because the negative net-worth families distort the whole calculation. Anyone with positive net worth, even $1, they point out, has more wealth than millions of American families. Lets take these critics suggestion and remove all the negative values at the bottom of the distribution, extinguishing the value of their debts that exceed their assets and assigning them a zero net worth instead. What does the comparison look like then? Not that different: After making this adjustment, about 15.4 million families (13.1 percent of the population) have zero net worth, no small number to be sure. But the Walmart heirs $89.5 billion is still equal to the combined net worth of the bottom 33.2 million families (about 28.2 percent of the total), even after extinguishing all negative net worth values in the SCF. Again, it should be noted that this modification of the SCF is just not an economically sound thing to do; the negative net-worth observations in the SCF data represent economic information (let alone the realities of millions of families) that cannot just be discarded because people think that the number of families that need to have their wealth added together to sum to the Walton familys total is arbitrarily too high in some way. To address these points in one last way, take the wealth of the Walton family ($89.5 billion) compared to the wealth of the median American familythat family that is wealthier than half of all others and less wealthy than half. In 2010, median wealth was $77,300 (down from $126,400 in 2007). How many of these typical American households (i.e., those with median wealthwealthier than fully half of the overall population) would you need to lump together to reach the Walton familys wealth? About 1.16 million, up from 580,000 in 2007. In short, it would still take a citys worth of families with the overall median wealth to match the Walton familys net worth. The figure below shows just how many families with median wealth would need to be combined to equal the Walton familys wealth, and how this has changed over time.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/dec/08/one-wisconsin-now/just-how-wealthy-wal-mart-walton-family/,Economy,Polifact
17711,Testimony before the Rhode Island Special Joint Legislative Commission to Study the Sales Tax Repeal,"Download Testimony before the Rhode Island Special Joint Legislative Commission to Study the Sales Tax Repeal Testimony before the Rhode Island Special Joint Legislative Commission to Study the Sales Tax Repeal November 21, 2013 Joseph Henchman Vice President for Legal & State Projects, Tax Foundation Mr. Chairman, Members of the Commission: Good afternoon. It is an honor and a pleasure for me to be in front of you today. For many years now, I've had the chance to come to Rhode Island to discuss tax policy with elected officials and Mr. Simmons has invited me up many times to speak at his events. Visiting the Ocean State is something I always truly look forward to. We at the Tax Foundation get a lot of mail and e-mail with crazy tax ideas. It's the nature of the business, I suppose. People convinced the Sixteenth Amendment was never ratified. People who have come up with their own new all-encompassing tax idea. Not a week goes by without something like that coming across our desk. Depending on who it is, we try to be polite and explain whatever needs to be explained. A state doing without a sales tax is not crazy. As you know, of course, there are five states that do without a state sales tax. Before eighty years ago, no state had a sales tax. They came about not as a well-thought-out, well-designed tax but as a crash implementation in the midst of crisisthe Great Depression. In fact, if you got the nation's public finance and state tax experts in a room, and asked them to design a sales tax, it would look very different from the sales tax that many states, including Rhode Island, have today. What 9 out of 10 public finance experts would say is that the sales tax should apply to all final sales of goods and services, while exempting all business inputs. That way, the tax is neutral, does not distort economic decisions, and keeps pace with the economy. Many state sales taxesincluding Rhode Islanddo the opposite. Many goods and nearly all services are exempt from tax, while business purchases are taxed. The result is that some items are taxed multiple times and others not at all. I think you all already know that Rhode Island's sales tax rate is high, both nationally and compared to its neighbors. But you may not know that Rhode Island's sales tax basewhat is and is not taxedis among the narrowest in the country. Only 25 percent of what people buy is subject to Rhode Islands sales tax. Only Illinois, Massachusetts, and New Jersey have narrower sales taxes. You are exempting 75 percent of the economy from the sales tax already and imposing a high rate on the rest that you do tax. I would say that this means reform of some kind is needed. We've spoken in the past on various reform measuresGovernor Chaffee's sales tax broadening plan right after he took office, Governor Carcieri's income tax changes, and so forth. I will be perfectly honest with you, when I first heard of the zero sales tax idea for Rhode Island, my first reaction wasnice idea but how can it possibly happen? Again, and you don't need me tell you this, Rhode Island depends on the sales tax for about 30 percent of its tax revenuea lower dependence than the average state but still a big number. Almost $900 million. So if you'll indulge me, there are three points I want to share as I thought about this idea and whether it should happen and, if so, how it can happen. First, no fiscal expertnot onewould tell you that a sales tax repeal would mean a 100 percent revenue loss of all $887 million. Taxes affect behavior, and that's as true of the sales tax as any other tax. Delaware has no sales tax and on the border with New Jerseywhich has the same sales tax rate as Rhode Islandthere are a bunch of retail stores that do a brisk business. I was just in Portland, Oregon, another state with no sales tax, and it has about the most vibrant independent retailer market in the country for a big city. People will drive out of their way to avoid that 7 percent. Those added sales will mean added business activity, added jobs, and added income and business tax payments to the state. So called ""static"" revenue estimates are easy to do but get more and more wrong the bigger the tax change. For a tax change like this, you have to know there will be strong dynamic effects. Where we start disagreeing is how much will come back of that $887 million. I know you have been hearing from the STAMP people, and the REMI people, and of course Mr. Dion and the DOR, and probably some others. They probably all agree that repealing the sales tax will lose more than $0 and less than $887 million, will create jobs of some positive net number, and will lead to increased business activity of some amount. All of these modelers have a reputation for being conscientious about doing their best to try and get as close as possible. It is, however, difficult to model the decisions of a million people in Rhode Island, and millions more in surrounding states, and estimate how their behavior will change with a bold tax change. Think about their results carefully, but I would agree there would be a revenue loss involved of much less than $887 million. Second, a spurious argument you should be aware of is the three legged stool argument. Now there are plenty of decent and sensible reasons to oppose a sales tax repeal or reduction but this is not one of them. The argument goes something like you need every major tax because that way you have a diversity of revenue options. Much like a stool needs three strong equal legs, a state revenue system needs three separate revenue sources. There is no academic evidence supporting this urban legend. In fact, the state with the most stable revenue over the last ten years was South Dakota: a state that doesnt even have corporate and individual income taxes, and gets nearly half its revenue from the sales tax. One of the most volatile was California: a state that has every major tax. Believe meits my home stateif theres a tax out there, California's got it. In reality, if you want a stable tax systemstable for government and for taxpayerswhat matters is that you have a well-structured tax system with broad bases and low rates. Having three revenue sources achieves nothing if each of them is badly designed, with high rates and narrow bases as in California. There's no magic number of taxes, whether it be 2, 3, or 120. What matters is that the taxes you do have be well-structured. Third, I cannot understate how intense the interstate competition for jobs and investment and people is becoming now. I chat with governors, economic development officers, site relocation experts, businesses big and small, and they are constantly looking at their options. Instantaneous communication and near-instantaneous transportation for people and goods means that, increasingly, people can live and work just about anywhere. And that means states increasingly need to be thinking aboutand if I leave you with one thought, it's thiswhy my state? Why should a business entrepreneur, a college graduate, or a venture capitalist pick here out of all the places in the world. Now I work at the Tax Foundation, but I freely admit taxes are not the only factor that go into these decisions. State services matter. Housing prices matter. Where you were born matters. Even the restaurant scene matters. New York has an awful tax system but they have the legacy of when they had a good tax systemWall Street and skyscrapers filled with corporate officersand you can buy a hot sandwich at 3:00 in the morning. The difficulty confronting Rhode Island is do you keep the awful tax systemone near the bottom of every national rankingand ""make it up"" with something else, or do you try do something bold to stand out and make the tax system better? We ran the sales tax repeal proposal through our State Business Tax Climate Index, where Rhode Island currently ranks 46th out of the 50 states, with a more business friendly tax system than only Minnesota, California, New Jersey, and New York. With no sales tax, Rhode Island would have rocketed up to 31st, a significant improvement. If reform were coupled with some reform of the corporate income taxtaking away some targeted tax credits and lowering the very high rateRhode Island could move into the top half of states on taxes. It can happen. Something bold is needed. New Hampshire and Montana, in particular, are two states with about the same population size as Rhode Island, and without any of the resource or business location miracles that allow Alaska or Delaware to go without a sales tax. I have a handout on these differences but that is how I would characterize this proposal: bold, difficult, but feasible.

21101,"With Stickers, a Petition and Even a Middle Name, Secession Fever Hits Texas","The official in East Texas, Peter Morrison, the treasurer of the Hardin County Republican Party, said in a statement that he had received overwhelming support from conservative Texans and overwhelming opposition from liberals outside the state in response to his comments in his newsletter. He said that it may take time for people to appreciate that the fundamental cultural differences between Texas and other parts of the United States may be best addressed by an amicable divorce, a peaceful separation. Photo The online petitions  created on the We the People platform at petitions.whitehouse.gov  are required to receive 25,000 signatures in 30 days for the White House to respond. The Texas petition, created Nov. 9 by a man identified as Micah H. of Arlington, had received more than 116,000 signatures by Friday. It asks the Obama administration to peacefully grant the withdrawal of Texas, and describes doing so as practically feasible, given the states large economy. Residents in other states, including Alabama, Florida, Colorado, Louisiana and Oklahoma, have submitted similar petitions, though none have received as many signatures as the one from Texas. A White House official said every petition that crossed the signature threshold would be reviewed and would receive a response, though it was unclear precisely when Micah H. would receive his answer.

Governor Perry believes in the greatness of our union, and nothing should be done to change it, a spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, said in a statement. But he also shares the frustrations many Americans have with our federal government. The secession movement in Texas is divergent, with differences in goals and tactics. One group, the Republic of Texas, says that secession is unnecessary because, it claims, Texas is an independent nation that was illegally annexed by the United States in 1845. (The groups leader and other followers waged a weeklong standoff with the Texas Rangers in 1997 that left one of its members dead.) Mr. Kilgore, the candidate who is changing his middle name, said he had not signed the White House petition because he did not believe that Texans needed to ask Washington for permission to leave. Our economy is about 30 percent larger than that of Australia, said Mr. Kilgore, 48, a telecommunications contractor. Australia can survive on their own, and I dont think well have any problem at all surviving on our own in Texas. Few of the public calls for secession have addressed the messy details, like what would happen to the states many federal courthouses, prisons, military bases and parklands. No one has said what would become of Kevin Patteson, the director of the states Office of State-Federal Relations, and no one has asked the Texas residents who received tens of millions of dollars in federal aid after destructive wildfires last year for their thoughts on the subject. But all the secession talk has intrigued liberals as well. Caleb M. of Austin started his own petition on the White House Web site. He asked the federal government to allow Austin to withdraw from Texas and remain part of the United States, in the event that Texas is successful in the current bid to secede.

21105,"ICYMI: Scott Walker's WEDC Faces ""Serious"" Problems","ICYMI: Scott Walker's WEDC Faces ""Serious"" Problems In typically secretive fashion, Scott Walker late Friday afternoon dumped the bad news that his troubled Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, which lost track of $56 million in taxpayer funds and has become a symbol of Walker's job-creation failures, faces serious problems, according to an internal memo. Scott Walkers unaccountable WEDC has faced problems since its sloppy inception. In September 2012, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development suspended the states Community Development Block Grant program, citing WEDCs ineligibility to administer such funds as they were not an instrumentality of the state. As recently as October, Scott Walker stated that, I want to make it clear that overwhelmingly the staff of the WEDC is doing a good job. The quasi-private agency, which is not legally bound to report their financial records and whose employees are not subject to state ethics laws, has also come under fire for a suspected bid-rigging scheme, its failure to recognize education and worker training as essential building blocks in economic development, and for its failure to create and attract family-sustaining jobs in Wisconsin. The internal memo cites WEDCs single-minded focus to drive job creation through new initiatives as the reason for any missteps that have been made. However, under Scott Walker, Wisconsin has been among the worst states for job creation and has the under-performed the rest of the Midwest, leading one in five Wisconsin business owners to say they foresee layoffs in the coming year. Scott Walkers WEDC was supposed to help create 250,000 new jobs and be the symbol of his first term in office, Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Mike Tate said Monday. Well, it HAS become emblematic of Scott Walker deception and mismanagement. WEDC has lost $56 million in taxpayer funds and is dogged with rumors of bid-rigging, has a board full of Walkers campaign donors, and is led by a career Walker campaign operative with zero business experience. Scott Walker has even removed the 250,000 jobs promise from his website. It sounds like WEDC is going to symbolize perfectly Walker's time in office.

As recently as March of this year, only two states (North Dakota and Alaska) were adding nonfarm jobs year-over-year. By May, the number of states posting year-to-year growth had improved to an even dozen. Now, based on June nonfarm employment figures from the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, jobs in the past 12 months are up in an expanded total of 20 states. These gains dont mean that job creation is on the verge of a boom, but the percentage decrease of 0.05 percent for the nation was the smallest recorded in two years of monthly year-over-year job losses. By Lee McPheters _EMAIL_ P. Carey (Note: Complete current and historical rankings and data on year-over-year non-agricultural employment changes for states and metro areas are available at the newly-expanded Job Growth Update, published by the W. P. Carey School, including extensive detail on employment by industry.) More state labor markets are pulling out of the economic slump created by the recession. As recently as March of this year, only two states (North Dakota and Alaska) were adding nonfarm jobs year-over-year. By May, the number of states posting year-to-year growth had improved to an even dozen. Now, based on June nonfarm employment figures from the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, jobs in the past 12 months are up in an expanded total of twenty states. These gains dont mean that job creation is on the verge of a boom. Employment in 30 states and the nation-as-a-whole declined over-the-year once again in June. But the percentage decrease of 0.05 percent for the nation was the smallest recorded in two years of monthly year-over-year job losses. Percentage gains are still small The largest employment percentage increase for the past 12 months was posted by New Hampshire (1.46%). Other states with gains exceeding one percent included Kentucky, Alaska, Indiana, and Utah (see table). While increases of one percent may seem small, the positive growth for states in June is far better than just a few months ago, when every state lost jobs year-over-year in December of 2009. In New Hampshire, the percentage gains were paced by strong increases in services both to businesses and consumers. Employment was up by more than 19 percent as the category administrative and support and waste management and remediation services within the business services industry added 5,000 new jobs.

21139,Point Person: Our Q&A with Rob Portman on the GOP's take,"The 2012 presidential election was billed variously as the most important of a generation, our lifetime or anyones lifetime. In truth, we had an election four years ago, and well have another in four years. Every presidential choice, in its own way, is pivotal to our nations history and certainly for the coming years for many reasons  not the least of which what it means for the two dominant political parties. In this case, the Democrats are triumphant and the Republicans despondent. Points asked one notable leader of each side, Democrat Bill Richardson and Republican Rob Portman, how they evaluate President Barack Obamas re-election and what it means for their party going forward. Richardson was governor of New Mexico from 2003 to 2011, served previously in Congress and was U.N. ambassador and energy secretary under President Bill Clinton. GOP Rep. Portman of Ohio helped Mitt Romney prepare for the presidential debates by playing the role of Obama. So what happened? It was a very close race here in Ohio and around the country, but ultimately, Governor Romney came up short. We are divided as a country and that showed in the close House, Senate and presidential results. I do think most voters are fiscally conservative and agree Washington must control spending, but we could have done a better job explaining why we had the better plan. Same with other issues, including the economy. Most people agree the Obama administrations policies have failed to create the jobs America needs. But my sense is they needed more information on how our plans would impact them and their families. What is it that Republicans need to do to recapture the White House? This was the second consecutive presidential race in which the GOP has come up short. Pretty much everywhere you turn, you see headlines about the GOP at a crossroads. It was a wake-up call for us. We need to reach beyond our base without sacrificing our core values, and it can be done. There is a common-sense conservative majority in swing states like Ohio, but its a more diverse group than the GOP base. What about minority voters? Newt Gingrich said after the election that the GOP faces an institutional challenge in facing up to the nations changing demographics, especially with Latinos. And others, like Jeb Bush, have been promoting a broader base for a good while. To get less than 30 percent of the Hispanic vote and less than 8 percent of the African-American vote shows the potential we have to reach out with an inclusive message of fiscal conservatism, pro-growth policies to help small business and a renewed emphasis on the opportunity society. You played President Obama in debate preparations for Mitt Romney, so you have some insight into his thinking and that of his party. You also took the role of Barack Obama in prepping John McCain for his debates with his challenger. What do you think is allowing Democrats to win? Is it values, ground-game, something else? I really believe we had the better argument on policy. Most people acknowledge the need to deal with the debt and deficit and focus on job creation through the private sector, not government. They understand we need to reform our economy to make it more competitive through improving and modernizing our tax, regulatory, worker training, energy and trade policies. Those were our policies. We had the change mantle and it was a change election. But we were not as effective on communications and were outspent until the very end. And, they had a better turnout operation and have more effectively used social media and technology to communicate with and motivate their voters and, ultimately, get them to the polls. Americans communicate in ways not thought of a decade ago. They get their news from sources not in existence two decades ago, and our tactics must adapt to the changing environment. Moving ahead, what needs to happen to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff? As you know, at the years end the nations looking at a double hit of automatic tax hikes and spending cuts. Economists are worried this could sharply curtail growth of the gross domestic product and spike unemployment. The American economy has for too long been gripped by uncertainty  about taxes, regulation, debt and now an $800 billion fiscal cliff. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has just told us that these massive tax increases and defense cuts, and other aspects of so-called sequestration, will take us into a recession and kill jobs. So, first, we must ensure that Americas families and job creators do not see their income taxes rise in January. Instead, we should continue the current tax rates and tax code for six months to a year, during which time Congress would be required to pass pro-growth tax reform that simplifies the complicated tax code, lowers rates, and generates more revenue through economic growth. Congress should also work to ensure that the drastic sequestration cuts to defense  which both parties agree will be devastating to national security  will not happen. But that doesnt mean Congress should ignore the deficit. Washington should adopt short-term spending cuts equivalent to the savings under sequestration from other parts of the nations budget on both the so-called mandatory and discretionary side to take us through the next six months or year, coinciding with tax reform. While averting the fiscal cliff, next year, which is a non-election year, Washington must finally reform our inefficient tax code to generate more growth and jobs, reform our important but unsustainable entitlement programs and curb the runaway spending that has pushed federal spending to its highest levels ever. Spending annually is now a staggering $30,000 per household and the accumulated debt is now $50,000 for every person in America. It is past time for Congress to confront head-on this immoral debt burden being left to future generations. What are the problems that you think the two parties can realistically solve? We hear a lot of good intentions now, but what are we likely to see in another six months or so? It is time for Congress to break through the partisan gridlock and address a whole range of issues, as outlined above. One issue ripe for bipartisan action is corporate tax reform. America now has the highest corporate tax rate in the world. This makes American businesses less competitive globally and harms job creators here at home, too. Approximately 70 percent of the corporate tax burden is ultimately borne by workers, and reform will ultimately help them by creating jobs and raising incomes. There is bipartisan agreement in Congress that we need to reduce the 35 percent corporate tax rate down to, at most, 25 percent. We can pay for these rate cuts by eliminating unnecessary and outdated loopholes that currently allow some corporations to nearly escape tax altogether. At worst, these reforms would be deficit-neutral. But if they make businesses more competitive and increase growth  as most economists believe  then these reforms would actually reduce the budget deficit. Its a win-win for businesses, workers, and the federal budget. This Q&A was conducted and condensed by Dallas Morning News editorial columnist William McKenzie.

21223,Transcript of Obama on '60 Minutes',"The following is a transcript of President Obama on CBS' ""60 Minutes."" STEVE KROFT: Four years ago, as a young senator, Barack Obama offered the country more inspiration than experience. Today, the graying president runs with all the advantages of incumbency, and all the encumbrances of a record dogged by a sluggish recovery and chronically high unemployment. For nearly two years now a Republican House has blocked almost every initiative he's offered. His signature domestic achievements, rescuing the auto industry and reforming health care remain controversial. Yet six weeks before the election, President Obama maintains a small lead in the polls. We spoke on September 12th in the White House Blue Room. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KROFT (on camera): Mr. President, you were elected four years ago, promising hope and change for the better. Your opponent argues that you have achieved neither. Country has rarely been so divided politically. And people are afraid for their jobs. I -- I know you know that. People are fearful about the future for the families. How do you respond to that? OBAMA: I think it's important to know where we've been and how far we have traveled. The month I was sworn into office, we were losing eight hundred thousand jobs a month. We ultimately would lose nine million jobs during the height of that Great Recession. We came in, made some tough decisions, everything from stabilizing the financial system to making sure that the auto industry survived, to making sure that we cut taxes for middle- class families so they had more money in their pockets, to helping states avoid massive layoffs of teachers and firefighters and police officers. And because of that we've now had thirty months of job growth, four and a half million new jobs, half a million jobs in manufacturing alone. And the question now for the American people is, ``Do we keep moving forward and continue to make progress or do we go backwards to the very policies that got us into this mess in the first place?'' We probably have not seen a clearer choice in an election in my lifetime. KROFT: On the campaign trail, Governor Romney has been portraying you as a -- a nice guy who doesn't have a clue... OBAMA: Mm-hm. KROFT: ... about the economy... OBAMA: Right. KROFT: ... or how the country works. That private enterprises -- the engine of growth in this -- in this country. And that's what create jobs, not big government. OBAMA: Yeah. KROFT: And that you're crushing economic freedom with taxes, regulations, and high-cost health care. OBAMA: Yeah. Well, it's a lot of rhetoric, but there aren't a lot of facts supporting it. Taxes are lower on families than they've been probably in the last fifty years. So I haven't raised taxes. I've cut taxes for middle-class families by an average of thirty-six hundred dollars for a typical family. When it comes to regulations, I've issued fewer regulations than my predecessor, George Bush, did during that same period in office. So it's kind of hard to argue that we've overregulated. Now, I don't make any apologies for putting in place regulations to make sure banks don't make reckless bets and then expect taxpayers to bail them out. I don't make any apologies for regulating insurance companies, so that they can't drop a family's coverage, just when somebody in their family needs it most. And, you know, the problem that Governor Romney has is that he seems to only have one note: tax cuts for the wealthy and rolling back regulations as a recipe for success. Well, we tried that vigorously between 2001 and 2008 and it didn't work out so well. KROFT: Your opponent, Governor Romney, has another note. OBAMA: Mm-hm. KROFT: That's unemployment. Forty-three months above eight percent. Huge profits on Wall Street. You've got the stock market that's doing incredibly well. And yet you've still got this unemployment. OBAMA: Oh, absolutely. Well, look, nobody's more con -- nobody's more concerned about the employment situation than I am. The problem we have was the hole was so deep when we got in that we lost nine million jobs, we've created four point six. We've still got a long way to go. Now I've put forward very specific plans that we know would create jobs. And that's not my opinion. That's the opinion of independent economists. My JOBS Act that I presented to Congress over a year ago, we said, ``Let's help put folks back to work. Let's make sure that we are getting construction workers on the job, rebuilding our infrastructure.'' It's estimated that would create an additional million jobs right now. But we haven't seen full implementation of that plan. KROFT: You've tried things that -- that haven't worked. I mean the jobs plan, the jobs bill -- you haven't been able to get it through Congress. OBAMA: Well, Steve... KROFT: I mean, isn't that some of your responsibility? OBAMA: I take full responsibility for everything that we do, Steve, but you're asking two different questions. You're asking a question, number one, have I been able to get every plan that would work through a Republican Congress... KROFT: Right. OBAMA: ... that said its number one priority was beating me as opposed to helping the American people? And there is no doubt that I've been disappointed in trying to get more cooperation from those folks. And that's something that we're going to have to continue to do. The second question you're asking, though, is has what we've done worked? And the fact of the matter is is that what we've done has been effective in improving the situation in -- in every area that we're talking about. You know when I made a decision to save the auto industry that saved a million jobs. One in eight jobs in Ohio is dependent on the auto industry. So we've actually seen success. KROFT: How are you going to get the Republicans to agree to a tax increase for the top two percent? You've been trying for a year. You haven't been able to do it. And you've got a majority of -- of -- of Republicans in Congress, including Governor Romney, who has signed a pledge never to increase taxes under any circumstances. OBAMA: Yeah, well, we... KROFT: How are you going to get them to change their minds and make this deal? OBAMA: I -- I won't get them to make them change their minds. The American people will. I mean, ultimately, the American people agree with me that the only way we bring down our deficit is to do it in a balanced way. So, keep in mind, I've agreed with the Republicans. And we've already cut a trillion dollars of spending. And I've told them I'm prepared to do additional spending cuts and do some entitlement reform. But what I've said is, ``You can't ask me to make student loans higher for kids who need it or ask seniors to pay more for their Medicare or throw people off of health care and not ask somebody like me or Mr. Romney to do anything, not ask us to do a single dime's worth of sacrifice.'' KROFT: How are you going to make a deal? OBAMA: Well, I think... KROFT: Why can't you -- why haven't you been able to make a deal? OBAMA: Well, be... KROFT: And why do you think you will be able to make a deal? OBAMA: Well, I think that when I first came into office, the head of the Senate Republicans say, ``My number one priority is making sure President Obama's a one term president.'' Now, after the election, either he will have succeeded in that goal or he will have failed at that goal. Either way, my expectation is, my hope is, that that's no longer their number one priority. And I'm hoping that after the smoke clears and the election season's over that that spirit of cooperation comes more to the fore. KROFT: You came in running as an outsider, somebody who was going to change Washington. Do you still believe after three years in this gridlock that we've had that -- that somebody who claims to be an outsider can get things accomplished in Washington? OBAMA: Oh, yeah. Well, look, I mean, we -- we passed historic legislation that strengthened our financial regulations. We passed legislation that will not only provide thirty million more people coverage, but also ensures that you know, kids can stay on their parents' health insurance plans till they are twenty-six and seniors have lower prescription drugs. And so change has happened and positive change for the American people. I -- I'm the first one to confess that the spirit that I brought to Washington, that I wanted to see instituted, where we weren't constantly in -- in a political slugfest, but were focused more on problem solving that, you know, I haven't fully accomplished that, haven't even come close in some cases. And you know if you ask me wha -- what's my biggest disappointment is that we haven't changed the tone in Washington as much as I would have liked. KROFT: And you don't bear any responsibility for that? OBAMA: Oh, I think that, you know, as President I bear responsibility for everything, to some degree and one of the things I've realized over the last two years is that that only happens if I'm enlisting the American people much more aggressively than I did the first two years. KROFT: The Great Recession began with the housing crisis. OBAMA: Mm-hm. KROFT: We still have the housing crisis. The banks got bailed out. The homeowners didn't. That was one of the decisions that you made. Very few homeowners have gotten mortgage relief. And your efforts to get the banks and the mortgage companies to renegotiate loans and modify terms have been underwhelming, to say the least. What happened? OBAMA: We have helped several million homeowners avoid foreclosure and make sure that the terms of their mortgage were ones that they could pay. Not everything you do right off the bat -- when you've got emergencies here, there, and everywhere, and we're all putting out fires -- not everything's going to work perfectly the first time. So, for example, the housing mortgage assistance program that we put in a place, we modified when we saw that there wasn't as much take-up as we wanted. And since that time, we've actually seen that the rates of people utilizing it go up dramatically. We still have a long way to go. But this is in contrast to Governor Romney's proposal. When asked about what we should do with mark -- the housing market, he said, ``Just let it bottom out.'' That's a quote. So he was opposed to even the modest proposals that we put into place. KROFT (voiceover): While most of our White House interview involved domestic policies, the President's day was dominated by foreign affairs. The attack on the Libyan consulate that left the U.S. ambassador and three others dead had occurred the night before... BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL: Wait for what? KROFT (voiceover): ... and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had inserted himself into the presidential campaign, criticizing the President and pushing him to lay out conditions for a military attack against Iran. (on camera): How much pressure have you been getting from Prime Minister Netanyahu to make up your mind to use military force in Iran? OBAMA: Well, look, I have conversations with Prime Minister Netanyahu all the time. And I understand and share Prime Minister Netanyahu's insistence that Iran should not obtain a nuclear weapon because it would threaten us, it would threaten Israel and it would threaten the world and kick off a nuclear arms race. KROFT: You're -- you're saying you don't feel any pressure from Prime Minister Netanyahu in the middle of a campaign to try and get you to change your policy and draw a line in the sand? You don't feel any pressure? OBAMA: When it comes to our national security decisions, any pressure that I feel is simply to do what's right for the American people. And I am going to block out any noise that's out there. Now I feel an obligation, not pressure but obligation, to make sure that we're in close consultation with the Israelis on these issues because it affects them deeply. They're one of our closest allies in the region. And we've got an Iranian regime that has said horrible things that directly threaten Israel's existence. KROFT: Have recent events in the Middle East given you any pause about your support for the governments that have come to power following the Arab Spring? OBAMA: Well, I'd said even at the time that this is going to be a rocky path. The question presumes that somehow we could have stopped this wave of change. I think it was absolutely the right thing for us to do to align ourselves with democracy, universal rights, a notion that people have -- have to be able to participate in their own governance. But I -- I was pretty certain and continue to be pretty -- pretty certain that there are going to be bumps in the road because, you know, in a lot of these places, the one organizing principle has been Islam. The one part of society that hasn't been controlled completely by the government. There are strains of extremism, and anti-Americanism, and anti-Western sentiment. And, you know, can -- can be tapped into by demagogues. There will probably be some times where we bump up against some of these countries and have strong disagreements but I do think that over the long term we are more likely to get a Middle East and North Africa that is more peaceful, more prosperous and more aligned with -- with our interests. This is a tumultuous time that we're in. But we can and we will meet those challenges if we stay true to who we are. (APPLAUSE) KROFT (voiceover): The day after our White House interview, we followed the President to Colorado, a crucial swing state in the upcoming election, to ask him a few more questions central to the campaign. (on camera): Most Americans think we're spending too much money. OBAMA: Mm-hm. KROFT: The national debt has gone up sixty percent in -- in the four years that you've been in office. OBAMA: Well, first -- first of all, Steve, I think it's important to understand the context here. When I came into office, I inherited the biggest deficit in our history. And over the last four years, the deficit has gone up, but ninety percent of that is as a consequence of two wars that weren't paid for, as a consequence of tax cuts that weren't paid for, a prescription drug plan that was not paid for, and then the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Now we took some emergency actions, but that accounts for about ten percent of this increase in the deficit, and we have actually seen the federal government grow at a slower pace than at any time since Dwight Eisenhower, in fact, substantially lower than the federal government grew under either Ronald Reagan or George Bush. KROFT: Since the Benghazi tragedy, your opponent has attacked you as being weak on national defense and weak on foreign policy. He says you need to be more aggressive in Iran, haven't done enough to support the revolt in Syria, and that our friends don't know where we stand, and our enemies think we're weak. OBAMA: Yeah. Well, let's see what I've done since I came into office. I said I'd end the war in Iraq. I did. I said that we'd go after Al Qaida. They've been decimated in the FATA. That we'd go after bin Laden. He's gone. So I've executed on my foreign policy. And it's one that the American people largely agree with. So, you know if -- if Governor Romney is suggesting that we should start another war, he should say so. (END VIDEOTAPE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KROFT: President Obama also reflected on the nature of leadership with us. We spoke following his campaign stop in Golden, Colorado. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KROFT (on camera): What are the essential qualities of a leader, in your mind? OBAMA: Well, you know, I -- I think that leadership more than anything is about setting a course and describing a vision for people. And you know, in the history of -- of leadership in this country that vision isn't always realized immediately. You know, Abraham Lincoln understood that we were a single union. And it took a bloody Civil War and terrible hardship and sacrifice to achieve that vision. And that vision wasn't even fully realized until after he was -- he was gone. What I try to do is to constantly present a -- a -- a vision of America in which everybody's got a shot, everybody's treated with respect and dignity in which the -- the divides of -- of race and faith, gender, sexual orientation, that that those are not the determining factors, in terms of whether people succeed but instead it's how hard you work and are you trustworthy and are you responsible and you -- do you look after your family and do you -- do you love people and love this country? KROFT: David McCullough, the noted presidential historian, said all the great Presidents have had a number of common traits. And one of them is an understanding of history and an understanding of the history of -- of the presidency. OBAMA: Yeah. KROFT: Is there anything that you've read or learned from your study of this area that has helped you? Any examples you can give me? OBAMA: Well, whenever I look at the -- the history of Presidents I deeply admire. The one thing that I'm always struck by is persistence. It's a quality that's underrated. Being able to plow through, being able to stay buoyant in the face of -- of challenges. And, you know, I think that's a characteristic of the American people. And, I think our best Presidents are able to tap into that resilience and that strength and that grit. And -- and -- and be inspired by it. KROFT: Where do you go to kind of sort things out on your own? And when do you find time to just be alone with your own thoughts? OBAMA: Well, I'm a night guy as it is. And so, Michelle usually goes to bed about 9:30. She's -- she's an early bird, maybe ten o'clock. The girls go to bed around ten. And so I've got those hours between ten o'clock and one o'clock in the morning, let's say, where not only do I do some work, but I do some reading, I do some writing. There are times where I sit on the Truman Balcony and it's as good of a view as you get with the -- the Washington Monument and the Jefferson Monument -- Memorial set back behind that. And so those are moments of reflection that, you know, help gird you for the next challenge and the next day. KROFT: Many times in our history there have been big ideas like going to the moon or the Marshall Plan. This campaign, some people think, has been devoid of big ideas, not necessarily that the budget deficit and some of these things aren't big ideas. But what would you like to see happen in your... OBAMA: Well... KROFT: ... in your four years? OBAMA: I -- I got to tell you, Steve, I think there's no bigger purpose right now than making sure that if people work hard in this country, they can get ahead. That's the central American idea. That's how we sent a man to the moon. Because there was an economy that worked for everybody and that allowed us to do that. I think what Americans properly are focused on right now are just the -- the bread- and-butter basics of making sure our economy works for working people. And if we can accomplish that there's no bigger idea than that. That's the idea that has attracted people to our shores for -- for generations.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/27/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-hes-responsible-just-10-percent-/,Economy,Polifact

21293,"Romney to college students: Pursue your dreams, even if you have to borrow to do so","WESTERVILLE, Ohio  Mitt Romney encouraged a group of several hundred college students at a small liberal arts school here Friday to pursue their educational and career ambitions  even if it means asking their parents for money if they need a hand in doing so. Addressing an auditorium full of students and faculty at Otterbein University as part of his latest effort to woo young voters, the GOP presidential frontrunner contended that President Obamas policies have amounted to an attack on success and on those who aspire to be successful. This kind of divisiveness, this attack on success is very different than what weve seen in our countrys history, he said. Weve always encouraged young people, take  take a shot, go for it. Take a risk. Get the education. Borrow money, if you have to, from your parents. Start a business. He went on to cite the example of Jimmy John, founder of the popular Illinois-based sandwich chain, who he said he had met with recently along the campaign trail. Romney told the crowd that as a young man, Jimmy John (whose full name is Jimmy John Liautaud) had borrowed $25,000 from his father in order to get his first restaurant off the ground. Liautauds father had made the loan on the condition that if his son wasnt able to return the money, with interest, within a year, he would have to join the Army. And, as you chucklingly indicated a moment ago, you know that his sandwiches are doing pretty well, Romney told the crowd. Hes got shops all over the country and thousands of people who work with him. This is kind of an American experience. Earlier Friday, in a roundtable with seven Otterbein students, one of the students raised the point that many young people cant find work related to their college majors. Romney noted that some majors tend to make it easier than others for students to find jobs post-graduation. With certain majors, theres a lot of openings ... as opposed to, say, English  as an English major, I can say this  as an English major, your options are  youd better go to graduate school and find a job from there, said Romney, who graduated with an English degree from Brigham Young University before heading to law and business school.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2012/sep/05/julian-castro/julian-castro-says-mitt-romney-advised-college-stu/,Economy,Polifact

21457,"As President Obama headed to Ohio, Rob Portman said the president squandered economic opportunity","WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama will speak soon in Cleveland, giving a campaign address in which he is expected to blast Republicans for their approach on fixing the economy. Meantime, a potential presidential-team rival on the Republican ticket, U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, said this morning that Obama's approach is -- and has been -- all wrong. For the recod, Portman stated for the umpteenth time that he is ""interested in staying where I am"" as a senator and helping a new president pass bills in Congress in 2013. His non-denial of interest in the Republican veep spot does little to quell widespread speculation that he will be Mitt Romney's running mate. That's one factor that made Portman's comments during a call with reporters noteworthy. He also represents Ohio, which Obama is visiting. And Portman was President George W. Bush's budget director from May 26, 2006 to Aug. 3, 2007. If Obama today makes a case that a Romney presidency would be like a return to the Bush White House, the comments of a former Bush budget chief could be relevant. Portman does not disagree that Obama ""inherited a tough economy, there's no question about it."" But Obama, he said, failed to adequately fix it when he took office in 2009, focusing too heavily on creating or keeping government jobs and too little on addressing the needs of the private sector. Obama has unfortunately kept that focus, Portman charged. ""His theory that he laid out was that we have to take tax dollars from you and from citizens all around our country and spend more money on government jobs,"" Portman said. ""Those government workers will then be given salaries that they then can take part of and go out and buy more, I guess, goods and services in the economy and that that is an efficient way to grow the economy. I dont think thats something that any economist who looks at our situation today would agree is the way to get out of this hole were in. I think they would say that if you look across the Atlantic, thats exactly the problem  they grew the size and scope of government too much and did not grow the private sector enough."" We have transcribed Portman's words on Obama and the economy, starting with his introductory comments and following with Portman's answer to our question on Obama's reported approach of comparing Romney's proposals to the Bush years. Introductory comments: I know the presidents in Ohio today doing another campaign stop. And Im glad hes in Ohio because it gives him the opportunity to see whats really going on in the economy. He said last week that the private sectors doing just fine and seemed to say that what we needed to do was to add government jobs to get the economy moving again. I think Ohioans get it that doesnt work. I think when hes around Ohio today hell find out that the private sectors not doing just fine. I hope he visits a factory when hes in Ohio today. Hell find out that people are struggling as they try to make ends meet amid what is the weakest economic recovery since the Great Depression. Were on the wrong track. The new jobs report that came out recently sadly had more bad news. It showed the unemployment number going up, not down. And the president tried to blame it on everything except his policies. Hes been finding excuses for months as to why the economy is not doing well. But what he has not focused on is the fact that the stimulus didnt work, nor does class warfare or anti-business rhetoric or a big-government approach including more regulations, more uncertainty, more taxes. This is not the way to get the economy moving again, and I think hell find that as he goes around Ohio if he talks to people who are in the private sector. The good news is there is a better way. There are smart ideas to help turn things around, including pro-growth tax reform, regulatory relief that is sensible, that acknowledges we need regulations but they ought to be based on cost-benefit analyses and the least-burdensome alternatives. We need a new energy plan. The exciting opportunities in Ohio and around the country to develop our own resources including shale gas and shale oil will create jobs, as well as give us more reliable and more affordable energy. So with a tax code thats more complicated than its been in decades, with regulatory and tax uncertainty freezing innovators and keeping cash on the sidelines, with spending out of control and with a real concern about where were headed in terms of the fiscal cliff, Washington needs to act and act now. In doing so, we could free up the private sector to create jobs the American economys capable of and Ohio families deserve. On Obama's campaign strategy: Well Im not going to give the president advice on his campaign strategy. What I will say is that the president inherited a tough economy, theres no question about it. The financial crisis was real, you know it occurred in 2008. And theres no question that there were some difficulties that the president had to address. The question is, what did he do with it? I would respectfully disagree that the stimulus worked. By the presidents own predictions, right now we would be under 6 percent unemployment if the stimulus had worked. Thats what he said. Thats what his advisors told him and told us. That hasnt happened, unfortunately. And the reason it hasnt happened is so much of those stimulus dollars (were) not used for anything resembling economic growth. It was used to grow the size and scope of government. And the president continues to believe this. When you listen to his comments the other day, I was much less concerned with him saying the public sectors doing just fine, because thats a point you can debate and look at. I think hes wrong, the facts say otherwise, but thats a point of debate. But what his real point was (was that) the private sectors doing fine, he said, but the government sector is not. That the reason the economy is weak is because we are losing too many government jobs. Well first of all, we are not losing government jobs. If you look at the overall net jobs in the federal government, weve actually seen an increase in federal government jobs, and pretty substantially. There have been some reductions in state and local jobs, I dont know what the net number is, but I would just make the point that I made earlier: If you are looking to grow the economy, the way to grow the economy is not to grow more public-sector jobs. Thats not even a theory that most Democrats, I hope, would agree with. His theory that he laid out was that we have to take tax dollars from you and from citizens all around our country and spend more money on government jobs. Those government workers will then be given salaries that they then can take part of and go out and buy more, I guess, goods and services in the economy and that that is an efficient way to grow the economy. I dont think thats something that any economist who looks at our situation today would agree is the way to get out of this hole were in. I think they would say that if you look across the Atlantic, thats exactly the problem  they grew the size and scope of government too much and did not grow the private sector enough. Youve got to grow the private-sector economy, which will create the opportunity for us to see more demand, to see more economic growth in the factory jobs in Ohio, in the ag sector we talked about earlier, in the service sector. And that will generate more revenue. That will help us deal with the deficit problem that we face. And it will help us to bring back jobs to a level that were more used to since the 1980s, which is in the range of 5-6 percent rather than, I really think were about 11 percent now when you look at the labor participation rates. You know, if we were just at the percent of people working who were working when President Obama was sworn in, that so-called labor participation rate, we would be at 11 percent unemployment right now. And I think thats closer to where we are even when you take out so many people who are under-employed. And that number of course is even higher, and they do keep track of those numbers, thats in the teens. So I just fundamentally disagree with the president about the approach. His approach is to help the economy, youve got to grow the government. My approach is that to help the economy, youve got to grow the private sector.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2012/jun/20/rob-portman/rob-portman-says-there-has-been-substantial-increa/,Economy,Polifact
21474,Employment Situation Summary,"Transmission of material in this news release is embargoed until USDL-18-1110 8:30 a.m. (EDT) Friday, July 6, 2018 Technical information: Household data: (202) 691-6378 * _EMAIL_ * www.bls.gov/cps Establishment data: (202) 691-6555 * _EMAIL_ * www.bls.gov/ces Media contact: (202) 691-5902 * _EMAIL_ THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION -- JUNE 2018 Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 213,000 in June, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.0 percent, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Job growth occurred in professional and business services, manufacturing, and health care, while retail trade lost jobs. Household Survey Data The unemployment rate rose by 0.2 percentage point to 4.0 percent in June, and the number of unemployed persons increased by 499,000 to 6.6 million. A year earlier, the jobless rate was 4.3 percent, and the number of unemployed persons was 7.0 million. (See table A-1.) Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (3.7 percent), adult women (3.7 percent), and Asians (3.2 percent) increased in June. The jobless rate for teenagers (12.6 percent), Whites (3.5 percent), Blacks (6.5 percent), and Hispanics (4.6 percent) showed little or no change over the month. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.) Among the unemployed, the number of job losers and persons who completed temporary jobs increased by 211,000 in June to 3.1 million, and the number of reentrants to the labor force rose by 204,000 to 2.1 million. (Reentrants are persons who previously worked but were not in the labor force prior to beginning their job search.) (See table A-11.) The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) increased by 289,000 in June to 1.5 million. These individuals accounted for 23.0 percent of the unemployed. (See table A-12.) In June, the civilian labor force grew by 601,000. The labor force participation rate edged up by 0.2 percentage point over the month to 62.9 percent but has shown no clear trend thus far this year. (See table A-1.) The employment-population ratio, at 60.4 percent, was unchanged in June and has essentially been flat since February. (See table A-1.) The number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers) was little changed in June at 4.7 million. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were working part time because their hours had been reduced or they were unable to find full-time jobs. (See table A-8.) In June, 1.4 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, little different from a year earlier. (Data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table A-16.) Among the marginally attached, there were 359,000 discouraged workers in June, down by 155,000 from a year earlier. (Data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.1 million persons marginally attached to the labor force in June had not searched for work for reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities. (See table A-16.) Establishment Survey Data Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 213,000 in June and has grown by 2.4 million over the last 12 months. Over the month, job gains occurred in professional and business services, manufacturing, and health care, while employment in retail trade declined. (See table B-1.) Employment in professional and business services increased by 50,000 in June and has risen by 521,000 over the year. Manufacturing added 36,000 jobs in June. Durable goods manufacturing accounted for nearly all of the increase, including job gains in fabricated metal products (+7,000), computer and electronic products (+5,000), and primary metals (+3,000). Motor vehicles and parts also added jobs over the month (+12,000), after declining by 8,000 in May. Over the past year, manufacturing has added 285,000 jobs. Employment in health care rose by 25,000 in June and has increased by 309,000 over the year. Hospitals added 11,000 jobs over the month, and employment in ambulatory health care services continued to trend up (+14,000). Construction employment continued to trend up in June (+13,000) and has increased by 282,000 over the year. Mining employment continued on an upward trend in June (+5,000). The industry has added 95,000 jobs since a recent low point in October 2016, almost entirely in support activities for mining. In June, retail trade lost 22,000 jobs, largely offsetting a gain in May (+25,000). Employment showed little or no change over the month in other major industries, including wholesale trade, transportation and warehousing, information, financial activities, leisure and hospitality, and government. The average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at 34.5 hours in June. In manufacturing, the workweek edged up by 0.1 hour to 40.9 hours, and overtime edged up by 0.1 hour to 3.5 hours. The average workweek for production and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls remained at 33.8 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.) In June, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 5 cents to $26.98. Over the year, average hourly earnings have increased by 72 cents, or 2.7 percent. Average hourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees increased by 4 cents to $22.62 in June. (See tables B-3 and B-8.) The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for April was revised up from +159,000 to +175,000, and the change for May was revised up from +223,000 to +244,000. With these revisions, employment gains in April and May combined were 37,000 more than previously reported. (Monthly revisions result from additional reports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.) After revisions, job gains have averaged 211,000 per month over the last 3 months. _____________ The Employment Situation for July is scheduled to be released on Friday, August 3, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. (EDT). _______________________________________________________________________________________ | | | 2018 Preliminary Benchmark Revision to the Establishment Survey Data will be | | Released on August 22, 2018 | | | |Each year, the establishment survey estimates are benchmarked to comprehensive counts | |of employment from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) for the month | |of March.

21513,Mandel developing rescue plan,"By David Skolnick _EMAIL_ YOUNGSTOWN Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, said he is developing a plan to rescue the auto industry. When asked about the $82 billion government bailout of General Motors and Chrysler in 2009, Mandel said in a Thursday call to The Vindicator, Our economy has not yet been rescued. So many people are still out of work. GM earned its largest profit ever in 2011, two years after the bailout. GM, with a complex in Lordstown that builds the Chevrolet Cruze, made a $7.6 billion profit last year. It received $49.5 billion of the bailout money. Im not saying the bailout didnt work, Mandel said. But Mandel said he respectfully disagreed that it saved the American auto industry. Justin Barasky, spokesman for U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, the Democrat incumbent who Mandel would face in the November general election if the latter wins Tuesdays Republican primary, mocked the state treasurers comments. Mandels claim to be putting together a plan to rescue the industry is a laughably candid example of how completely clueless he is as to whats going on with Ohios middle class and how hell say anything to get elected, Barasky said. Brown was a vocal proponent who voted for the auto bailout, which saved thousands of jobs in Ohio, Barasky said. Also, Mandel said responsible oil and gas exploration is a key platform of his Senate campaign. When asked in mid- January about the decision by Gov. John Kasich, a fellow Republican, to declare a moratorium on brine- injection wells within a seven-mile radius of a Youngstown well, near the epicenter of 12 earthquakes, a Mandel campaign spokesman said the candidate doesnt have an opinion on it. The earthquakes attracted international media attention. On Thursday, Mandel said he wasnt familiar with the decision at the time, but now that I learned more about it, the governor took a responsible approach. Barasky said Mandel is admitting ignorance about natural-gas exploration. Though hes campaigned for the Senate seat for a year and turned in nominating petitions by the Dec. 7 deadline, Mandel said he officially announced his candidacy Thursday, less than a week before the Tuesday primary. He said he waited because he wanted to clean up the treasurers office, something he said he did this week. We are now running one of the most effective and efficient treasurers offices in the country, he said. Mandel, who criticized Brown as an ineffective career politician, will make a campaign stop at 10 a.m. Saturday at Eastwood Malls community room in Niles. I think the Mahoning Valley is going to be one of the key areas in America that helps rebuild the manufacturing backbone of our country, he said.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2012/may/18/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-campaign-says-josh-mandel-opposes-au/,Economy,Polifact
21524,"Remarks by the President, Albany, NY","College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering State University of New York Albany, New York 1:24 P.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT: Hello, New York! (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat. It is great to be back in Albany. It is wonderful to be with all of you here today. And I want to thank Governor Cuomo not only for the outstanding introduction, but also for the extraordinary leadership that he's showing here in the great state of New York. Please give him a big round of applause. (Applause.) He is doing outstanding work. I also want to thank Mayor Jennings, who's here. Give the Mayor a big round of applause. (Applause.) Don't be shy. We've got Chancellor Zimpher -- (applause) -- we appreciate very much. Dr. Kaloyeros -- I want to make sure I say that right, folks mess up my name all the time -- (laughter) -- Kaloyeros for hosting us here today. (Applause.) Weve got a couple members of Congress here -- Paul Tonko. (Applause.) And also, Representative Chris Gibson is here. (Applause.) And all of you are, and I'm happy about that. (Applause.) Yes. So it is wonderful to be here at the University of Albany NanoCollege. This is one of the only colleges in the world dedicated to nanotechnology. And its a incredible complex. But youre working on particles as small as an atom, and youre doing it in rooms that are 10,000 times cleaner than a hospital operating room - which is very impressive, since ""clean"" is not usually a word I associate with college students. (Laughter.) Maybe things have changed since I was in school. Now, the reason I came here today is because this school -- bless you -- and this community represents the future of our economy. Right now, some of the most advanced manufacturing work in America is being done right here in upstate New York. Cutting-edge businesses from all over the world are deciding to build here and hire here. And youve got schools like this one that are training workers with the exact skills that those businesses are looking for. Now, we know the true engine of job creation in this country is the private sector -- it's not Washington. But there are steps we can take as a nation to make it easier for companies to grow and to hire, to create platforms of success for them -- everything from giving more people the chance to get the right training and education to supporting new research projects into science and technology. In fact, there was a substantial investment made here -- I was talking to Governor Cuomo about the investment his father made here to help get this center started. There are things we can do to make sure that if youre willing to work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can find a job, own a home, maybe start a business, and most importantly, give your kids a chance to do even better than you did. And thats something we believe has to be available to everybody, no matter where you come from, no matter what you look like. We can make a difference. And at this make-or-break moment for America's middle class, theres no excuse for inaction. Theres no excuse for dragging our feet. None. Now, over the last few years, there are certain steps that Ive been able to take on my own to help spur the kind of innovation that we're seeing here, and also to help the overall economy grow. So we announced a new policy several months back that will help families refinance their mortgages, save up to thousands of dollars a year. We sped up loans and competitive grants for new projects all across the country so thousands of construction workers can get back on the job. We simplified the student loan process to help roughly 5.8 million students -- like the students here -- save money on repayments. (Applause.) So these are some steps that the administration has been able to take on its own. But the truth is, the only way we can accelerate the job creation that takes place on a scale that is needed is bold action from Congress. Because of the Recovery Act, because of all the work we've done, we've created over 4 million jobs over the last two years. We've created hundreds of thousands of jobs each month over the last several months. So we're making progress, but everybody knows we need to do more. And in order to do that, we're going to need some more action from Congress. Democrats and Republicans have to come together. And they've shown that they can do it. I mean, they did some important work. They passed tax cuts for workers, approved trade deals to open up new markets for American products. We reformed our patent system to make it easier for innovative ideas to come to market. Those are all good things. But the size of the challenges we face requires us to do more. So back last September, I sent Congress a jobs bill that included all sorts of policies that we knew would help grow our economy and put more Americans back to work. That wasn't just my opinion, that wasn't just the opinion of Democrats. It was the opinion of independent, nonpartisan experts -- economists who do this for a living, and analysts on Wall Street who evaluate what's going to really make the economy grow. The one big piece that we were able to get done was make sure that we didn't see payroll tax go up and people get 40 bucks taken out of their paychecks each time. But most of it didn't get done in Congress. Just about every time we put these policies up for a vote, the Republicans in Congress got together and they said no. They said no to putting hundreds of thousands of construction workers back on the job repairing our roads and our bridges and our schools and our transit systems. No to a new tax cut for businesses that hire new workers. No to putting more teachers back in our classrooms, more cops back on the beat, more firefighters back to work. And this is at a time when we know one of the biggest drags on our economy has been layoffs by state and local governments -- that's true all across the country. And it's worth noting, by the way -- this is just a little aside -- after there was a recession under Ronald Reagan, government employment went way up. It went up after the recessions under the first George Bush and the second George Bush. So each time there was a recession with a Republican President, compensated -- we compensated by making sure that government didn't see a drastic reduction in employment. The only time government employment has gone down during a recession has been under me. (Applause.) So I make that point just so you don't buy into this whole bloated government argument that you hear. And frankly, if Congress had said yes to helping states put teachers back to work and put the economy before our politics, then tens of thousands more teachers in New York would have a job right now. That is a fact. And that would mean not only a lower unemployment rate, but also more customers for business. Now, I know this is an election year. But it's not an excuse for inaction. Six months is plenty of time for Democrats and Republicans to get together and do the right thing, taking steps that will spur additional job creation right now. Just saying no to ideas that we know will help our economy isnt an option. Theres too much at stake. We've all got to pull in the same direction. So even if Republicans are still saying no to some of the bigger proposals we made in the jobs act, there are some additional ideas that could help people get to work right now and that they haven't said no to yet -- so I'm hoping they say yes. And theyre simple ideas. Theyre the kinds of things that, in the past, have been supported by Democrats and Republicans. These are traditionally ideas that have had bipartisan support. They wont have as big of an impact as rebuilding our infrastructure or helping states hire back teachers, but together, all of these ideas will do two things: They'll grow the economy faster and they'll create more jobs. So today Im announcing a handy little ""To-Do"" list that weve put together for Congress. (Laughter.) You can see it for yourselves at whitehouse.gov. Its about the size of a Post-It note, so every member of Congress should have time to read it -- (laughter) -- and they can glance at it every so often. And hopefully we'll just be checking off the list -- just like when Michelle gives me a list, I check it off. (Laughter.) Each of the ideas on this list will help accelerate our economy and put people back to work -- not in November, not in next year, but right now. All right, so I'm going to go through the list. First, Congress needs to help the millions of Americans who have worked hard, made their mortgage payments on time, but still have been unable to refinance their mortgages with these historically low rates. This would make a huge difference for the economy. (Applause.) Families could save thousands of dollars, and that means they've got more money in their pocket, which means they can either build their equity back up on their homes or they go out and use that money to do things like helping their kids finance a college education. So Congress should give those responsible homeowners a chance to refinance at a lower rate. We estimate they'd save at least $3,000 a year. So thats on our ""To-Do"" list. It's not complicated. (Applause.) Second, if Congress fails to act soon, clean energy companies will see their taxes go up and they could be forced to lay off employees. In fact, we're already hearing from folks who produce wind turbines and solar panels and a lot of this green energy that they're getting worried because there's uncertainty out there. Congress hasn't renewed some of the tax breaks that are so important to this industry. And since I know that the other side in Congress have promised they'll never raise taxes as long as they live, this is a good time to keep that promise when it comes to businesses that are putting Americans to work and helping break our dependence on foreign oil. (Applause.) So we should extend these tax credits. Thats on the ""To-Do"" list. Thats number two. Number three, Congress should help small business owners by giving them a tax break for hiring more workers and paying them higher wages. (Applause.) We believe small businesses are the engine of economic growth in this country. We should not hold them to a situation where they may end up having to pay higher taxes just by hiring more workers. We should make it easier for them to succeed. So thats on our ""To-Do"" list. Thats number three. Number four, Congress should help our veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan find a good job once they come home. (Applause.) Our men and women in uniform have served this country with such honor and distinction -- a lot of them come from upstate New York. Now its our turn to serve them. So we should create a Veterans Job Corps that helps them find work as cops and firefighters, employees at our national parks. Thats on our ""To-Do"" list. Then the last item, the fifth item, which bears especially on what's going on here -- the last item on our congressional ""To-Do"" list is something that will help a lot of you in particular. You know better than anybody that technology has advanced by leaps and bounds over the last few decades. And thats a great thing. Businesses are more productive; consumers are getting better products for less. But technology has also made a lot of jobs obsolete. Factories where people once thought theyd retire suddenly left town. Jobs that provided a decent living got shipped overseas. And the result has been a lot of pain for a lot of communities and a lot of families. There is a silver lining to all of this, though. After years of undercutting the competition, now its getting more expensive to do business in places like China. Wages are going up. Shipping costs are going up. And meanwhile, American workers are getting more and more efficient. Companies located here are becoming more and more competitive. So for a lot of businesses, its now starting to make sense to bring jobs back home. (Applause.) And here in the tri-city area, youve got companies like IBM and Global Foundries that could have decided to pack up and move elsewhere, but they chose to stay in upstate New York because it made more sense to build here and to hire here. You have more to offer -- got some of the best workers in the world, you've got an outstanding university. Now I want whats happening in Albany to happen all across the country -- places like Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh. (Applause.) I want to create more opportunities for hardworking Americans to start making things again, and selling them all over the world stamped with those proud words: Made in America. Thats the goal. (Applause.) So the good news is were already starting to see it happen. American manufacturers are creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s. And thats good for you, but its also good for the businesses that supply the materials you use. Its good for the construction workers who build the facilities you work in. Its good for communities where people are buying more houses and spending more money at restaurants and stores. Everybody benefits when manufacturing is going strong. So youve heard about outsourcing. Today, more and more companies are insourcing. One recent study found that half of Americas largest companies are thinking of moving their manufacturing operations from China back to the United States of America. (Applause.) Thats good news. Because even when we cant make things cheaper than other countries because of their wage rates, we can always make them better. Thats who we are. Thats what America is all about. (Applause.) So this brings me back to our ""To-Do"" list. What we need to do now is to make it easier for more companies to do the right thing, and one place to start is our tax code. At the moment, companies get tax breaks for moving factories, jobs and profits overseas. They can actually end up saving on their tax bill when they make the move. Meanwhile, companies that choose to stay here are getting hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world. That doesnt make sense. And politicians from both parties have been talking about changing it for years, so Ive put forward my own plan to make it right in the long term. But in the short term, before we completely rework the tax code, before we've done a full-blown tax reform, at the very least what we can do right away is stop rewarding companies who ship jobs overseas and use that money to cover moving expenses for companies that are moving jobs back here to America. (Applause.) So we're putting that on Congresss ""To-Do"" list. This is something simple to do. We shouldnt wait. We should get it done right now. So thats the fifth item. That's all on our ""To-Do"" list. I'm not trying to overload Congress here. (Laughter.) So over the next few weeks, Im going to be taking about this ""To-Do"" list when I'm on the road. Im going to be talking about all the things that Congress can do right now to boost our economy and accelerate even more job growth. Of course, its not enough just to give them the list -- we've also got to get them to start crossing things off the list. And thats where all of you come in. I'm going to need you to pick up the phone, write an email, tweet, remind your member of Congress we cant afford to wait until November to get things done. Tell them now is the time to help more Americans save money on their mortgages; time for us to invest more in clean energy and small businesses; it's time for us to help more veterans find work; and it's time to make it easier for companies to bring jobs back to America. It's the right thing to do. Now, I'm cheating a little bit. I said that was my ""To-Do"" list. There actually is one other thing they've got to do. Before they do anything else, Congress needs to keep student loan rates from doubling for students who are here and all across the country. (Applause.) That has to happen by January 1st [sic] or rates on Stafford loans double. These young people are nodding their heads -- they don't like that. They've heard about this. (Laughter.) And we need to pass a transportation bill that guarantees almost a million construction workers can stay on the job. (Applause.) The good news is both parties say they want to make this happen. Weve done this before. So Congress just needs to work out the details. Don't let politics get in the way. Get this done before July 1st. Those bills should be passed right now. So I'm cheating a little bit. There are actually seven items on the ""To-Do"" list. (Laughter.) But two of them are old business and folks have already said they want to get them done. Albany, weve got a long way to go if were going to make sure everybody who wants a job can find one, and every family can feel that sense of security that was the essence of America's middle-class experience. But we can't just go back to the way things used to be. We've got to move forward -- to an economy where everybody gets a fair shot, everybody is doing their fair share, everybody plays by the same set of rules. And that's what you guys are doing here in Albany. You're investing in your future. You're not going backwards, you're going forward. With your help, I know we can get there -- because here in America, we dont give up. We keep moving. We look out for one another. We pull each other up. Thats who we are. And if we work together with common purpose, I've got no doubt we can keep moving this country forward and remind the world just why it is the United States of America is the greatest nation on Earth. (Applause.) Thank you so much, everybody. God bless you. God bless America. (Applause.) END 1:44 P.M.

21537,Buffett rule fails Senate vote in tax fight,"WASHINGTON  - Senate Republicans on Monday blocked President Barack Obamas Buffett Rule legislation, which would have put a 30-percent minimum tax on millionaires, in a debate that is likely to resonate through the November general election. President Barack Obama speaks about the Buffett Rule in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House complex in Washington, April 11, 2012. REUTERS/Larry Downing Democrats, as expected, failed to garner the 60 votes needed in the 100-member Senate to move to a full debate and vote on the bill aimed at getting more tax revenues out of the wealthy. Obama and congressional Republicans are squaring off this week over the tax hikes for millionaires and a Republican plan to give new tax cuts for businesses. Tonight, Senate Republicans voted to block the Buffett Rule, choosing once again to protect tax breaks for the wealthiest few Americans at the expense of the middle class, Obama said in a statement. Though scant changes to tax policy are expected ahead of the November 6 election, the skirmishes are giving voters a preview of debates they will hear over the next seven months. Obama and his fellow Democrats argue that raising taxes on the rich will help reduce deficits and bring more fairness to the tax code. Republicans are pushing a much different narrative of tax cuts - even if they add to deficits - as a way of creating jobs. As Americans scurried to file tax returns by Tuesday, the Senate debated the Buffett Rule, which would require households earning more than $1 million to pay at least a 30-percent tax rate. Central to Obamas tax fairness re-election campaign theme, the rule is named after billionaire Warren Buffett, who supports it and famously complains that he pays a lower effective tax rate than his secretary. Republicans argued that raising taxes would hurt the fragile economy. Fifty-one senators voted for the bill, while 45 senators voted no, effectively killing it. Republican Senator Susan Collins voted for the tax hike, while Democratic Senator Mark Pryor voted against it. A series of pivotal decisions on tax policy are looming at the year-end, when lower tax rates for all individuals - enacted under former President George W. Bush - are set to expire. These include estate, capital gains and dividend tax rates. Economists worry that partisan wrangling after the presidential and congressional elections could stall action on those decisions and several other measures, hobbling the economic recovery. Politicians time would be better spent working on an overhaul of the tax system that could actually pass rather than reforms that are likely to go nowhere, said Maya MacGuineas, president of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Budget. CLASS WARFARE? Republicans say the Buffett measure will do nothing to solve the larger problem of deficits and unemployment. We have a president that seems more interested in pitting people against each other than he is in doing anything, said Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell. He was hitting on a Republican theme that raising taxes on the rich was tantamount to class warfare. On Thursday Republicans - in firm control the House of Representatives - are expected to debate and likely approve a bill to give a one-year, 20-percent tax deduction on business income to owners of businesses with fewer than 500 employees. Republicans are portraying that tax cut as one for small businesses, a group they say the Buffett Rule will harm. Democrats say the legislation will add to already huge budget deficits, since Republicans do not include any measures to offset the $46 billion revenue loss. And they cite studies showing that the tax cut will mainly go to those with incomes over $200,000 a year. That measure is not likely to make it through the Senate. BATTLE ESCALATING The battle over taxes has been escalating for weeks with the White House speaking nearly daily about the Buffett Rule. The Obama campaign played offense last week by releasing the presidents tax returns several days before the deadline, to put pressure on Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Obama and his wife paid about 20.5 percent of their income in taxes in 2011, compared to an estimated 15.4 percent rate paid by the Romneys. Romney, however, has asked for an extension to file his taxes. A Gallup poll out on Monday said that Americans are split fairly evenly between those who say their federal tax bill is fair and those who say they pay too much. But when asked specifically about how the wealthy are taxed, about 60 percent back some kind of Buffett Rule, Gallups surveys have found. It is a robust finding across whichever polls that ask, you usually get 60 percent plus that say, yes, higher income are paying too little, Frank Newport, editor in chief of Gallup polling, said. The polling, telephone interviews with about 1,000 adults, has a margin of error of 4 percentage points.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2012/may/06/sheldon-whitehouse/sheldon-whitehouse-said-47-billion-raised-over-10-/,Economy,Polifact
21662,Fourth Time's A Charm: How Donald Trump Made Bankruptcy Work For Him,"Here at FORBES, we've been tracking Donald Trump's wealth since the inaugural Forbes 400 rich list in 1982. Today, we value him at $2.7 billion, although he claims he's worth far more. One question we're often asked when talk turns to Trump's fortune: how can a man who has been bankrupt so many times remain a multi-billionaire? How is he worth more now, post-bankruptcies? We spoke to bankruptcy lawyers and casino industry experts -- some of whom have had firsthand involvement in Chapter 11 cases connected to Trump -- in an attempt to explain how he has survived corporate bankruptcies and thrived in the aftermath. 1. It's nothing personal... First things first: Donald Trump has filed for corporate bankruptcy four times, in 1991, 1992, 2004 and 2009. All of these bankruptcies were connected to over-leveraged casino and hotel properties in Atlantic City, all of which are now operated under the banner of Trump Entertainment Resorts. He has never filed for personal bankruptcy -- an important distinction when considering his ability to emerge relatively unscathed, at least financially. ""Corporations, limited partnerships, and LLCs in which he had an ownership interest or companies that had his name attached have filed for bankruptcy,"" said Michael Viscount of Atlantic City law firm Fox Rothschild LLP, who represented unsecured creditors when Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts, as it was then called, filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2004. ""Therein lies the big distinction. (See: Trump Exaggerating His Net Worth (By 100%) In Presidential Bid) He did take a personal hit the first time around: he'd financed the construction of the Trump Taj Mahal with junk bonds and was unable to pay the high interest. His business was in the red, and so was he, to the tune of about $900 million in personal debt. By the mid-90s, he'd reduced most of that debt, selling his Trump Princess yacht, his Trump Shuttle airline, and his stake in a handful of other businesses. More importantly, he stopped guaranteeing debt with his own wealth. ""The first bankruptcy was the only time his personal fortune was at stake,"" said Ted Connolly, a Boston bankruptcy lawyer who used Trump as model for getting out of debt in his book The Road Out Of Debt: Bankruptcy and Other Solutions to Your Financial Problems. ""He learned from it. He's insulated."" 2. ...it's just business. Trump has never apologized for using Chapter 11 as a business tool -- indeed, when he spoke to my FORBES colleague Keren Blankfeld recently, he noted that many ""great entrepreneurs"" have used bankruptcy to restructure debt, free up capital and improve their businesses. ""Ive cut debt -- by the way, this isnt me personally, its a company,"" Trump said. ""Basically Ive used the laws of the country to my advantage and to other peoples advantage just as Leon Black has, Carl Icahn, Henry Kravis has, just as many, many others on top of the business world have."" But to those uninitiated in bankruptcy laws, four instances of corporate bankruptcy in a row can seem staggering. ""To the ordinary person in the street, it may seem surprising, but certainly not to me,"" said Reed Smith partner Michael Venditto, who has represented clients in high profile Chapter 11 cases, including bankrupt airline TWA. ""Chapter 11 is how you reshape and restructure a company that has problems. It doesn't indicate anything nefarious or even bad management."" 3. It's better than the alternative. More important, said Venditto, are the repercussions Chapter 11 might have for creditors versus, say, liquidation. ""You can have a visceral reaction to the fact that this company has gone through Chapter 11 multiple times, but the bondholders look at it and the alternatives are much, much worse. What is an empty casino sitting on the Atlantic City boardwalk worth? If it's operating and it's got cash flow and income, it may not be able to pay back every cent on the dollar, but the creditors are better off in the long run."" 4. He's leveraged his persona. Trump's name and image have undoubtedly helped him survive each bankruptcy and come out on top. He's able to demand a high percentage of reorganization equity based on the value his brand brings to a casino or hotel operation. So says Edward Weisfelner, a partner at New York firm Brown Rudnick who was involved in two of the three casino bankruptcies, first representing bondholders, then as counsel to Carl Icahn's firm Icahn Partners, who tried to buy most of the debt in Trump Entertainment Resorts. The leverage he had was that his name was on the side of his casinos,"" said Weisfelner. ""The cost of throwing him out, rebranding and changing his name everywhere would be very high. "" Added Joseph Weinert, senior vice president at Atlantic City casino consultancy Spectrum Gaming Group, who has produced research for Trump: ""The stakeholders decided they were better off with Trump's name than they were without it."" 5. He has less and less interest in the bankrupt companies. With each bankruptcy proceeding, Donald Trump's stake in the casinos and hotels in Atlantic city that bear his name has decreased. In the first Trump Taj Mahal bankruptcy, he handed over 50% equity to bondholders in return for favorable interest rates. In 2004's Chapter 11 filing, his stake was reduced to 25%. During wranglings with bondholders immediately before the 2009 bankruptcy, Trump resigned from the board of Trump Entertainment Resorts; his equity stake is now 5%, with another 5% in warrants. 6. He's not the one to blame. Atlantic City lawyer Viscount doesn't believe Donald Trump himself should be held accountable for any of his company's bankruptcies -- his creditors, he said, knew what they were getting themselves into when they lent Trump money over and over again. Theyre all big boys and girls,"" he said. ""Theyve all played this game before, in the insolvency space. The company that possessed his name filed bankruptcy because it was overleveraged. What does that tell you? People want to lend him money. He does grandiose things with it.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2012/mar/15/robert-jacquard/rhode-island-state-rep-robert-b-jacquard-says-many/,Economy,Polifact
22033,"Remarks by the President on the American Jobs Act in Emporia, VA","Greensville County High School Emporia, Virginia 5:43 P.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT: Hello! (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Hello, Eagles! (Applause.) Well, it is good to be here. Thank you very much. (Applause.) It's great to be back in Virginia. (Applause.) It is great to be here at Greensville County High School. (Applause.) I want to thank Jami Clements not only for the gracious introduction, but congratulate her on being selected as Greensville County Teacher of the Year. (Applause.) We're proud of everything that Jami has accomplished here at the school, but we also want to thank her for her service in our armed forces, and that is an extraordinary combination of service -- teaching and serving. (Applause.) And I know that the students feel very lucky to have her in the classroom. And I like that she's teaching biology, because we need some scientists out there. In addition, I want to acknowledge, first of all the superintendent of schools, Philip Worrell. Give your superintendent a big round of applause. (Applause.) And I want to acknowledge the principal, Wayne Scott. (Applause.) And finally, I want to thank your mayor, Mr. Sam Adams, for being with us here today. (Applause.) Now, some of you may have heard were taking a little road trip at the beginning of this week. The RV is a little bigger than most. (Laughter.) We've got it parked outside. But I decided it was time to get out of Washington and hit the open road. (Applause.) So we landed in Asheville, North Carolina -- and that truly is God's country -- and we drove through beautiful mountain roads and stopped for some barbecue and a little sweet tea. And we went to Boone County, North Carolina, and they had a general store there with big barrels of candy, and so we stocked up for Halloween and -- dont tell Michelle. (Laughter.) But we bought a lot of candy. (Laughter.) But most importantly, the reason that we have been traveling on the road is because I wanted to hear from folks like you. It doesnt seem like your voices are heard enough in Washington. (Applause.) They don't seem to be listening. So I figured if I brought the press here, then they could hear you. Because times are tough for a lot of Americans. Here in Virginia, there are a lot of folks who've spent months, maybe some folks spent years, looking for work. Others are doing their best just to get by. Maybe they're giving up going out to a restaurant -- they just can't afford it. They've got to save on gas. End of the month they're worried about making the mortgage payment. Some people are postponing retirement to make sure that their children can go to college. Hours have been cut back. Family businesses on the brink of being shut down. So its hard. And I think most Americans know that our economic problems werent caused overnight. Obviously we're going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and the aftermath hit Main Streets all across the country. But even before the financial crisis hit, people had seen their wages flat, their incomes flat. Had a chance to meet some farmers back here today -- crops are good this year, but family farms have been going through tough times. Health care skyrocketing in terms of cost. College tuition skyrocketing. AUDIENCE: Yes! THE PRESIDENT: We don't have an energy policy in this country, so we're still dependent on foreign oil. When gas shoots up, suddenly everybody doesnt know what to do. These are problems that built up over a decade or more. They wont be solved overnight. It's going to take time to rebuild an America -- (applause) -- to rebuild an America where hard work is valued and responsibility is rewarded; where people don't feel like they've got the deck stacked against them; where everybody is getting a fair shot and everybody is contributing their fair share. It is going to take time to rebuild an America where we restore security for the middle class and opportunity for folks trying to get in the middle class, an economy that works for everybody and not just for folks at the top. Thats our goal. (Applause.) And it will take time to rebuild an economy that is competitive in the 21st century, thats built to last -- one where we can out-build and out-compete, out-educate, out-innovate other nations -- which means weve got to step up on our education. Weve got to invest in basic science. Weve got to improve our infrastructure. We've got to close our deficits. We've got to get our fiscal house in order. We got a lot of work to do. Its going to take time. But Im here to tell you we are going to get it done. We are going to keep fighting. (Applause.) Were going to keep striving. Were going to focus on putting people back to work and helping middle-class Americans get ahead, and we will give the economy the jolt that it needs. And there are things that we can be doing right now to help the American people. Thats why I sent Congress the American Jobs Act. This is a jobs bill that contains the kind of proposals that in the past have been supported by both Democrats and Republicans. Its a bill thats paid for. It will not add to the deficit. It will not be going on the credit card. It will be paid for by asking our wealthiest citizens, our most fortunate -- people like me -- people who are making more than a million dollars, to pay their fair share. (Applause.) Independent economists have looked at this jobs bill, and theyve said it will create nearly 2 million jobs. Thats not my opinion, thats not the opinion of folks who work for me -- thats the opinion of people who study the economy for a living. They tell us this will grow the economy and put people back to work right away. So the question is, if its paid for, wont add to the deficit, wont result in increasing your taxes, will instead result in lowering your taxes, will put people back to work at a time when the unemployment rate is too high -- why wouldnt we do it? Why wouldnt we pass it? It turns out the folks in Washington arent listening to you. Last week, all the Republicans in the United States Senate got together and they blocked this jobs bill. They refused to even debate it, even though a majority of senators wanted it debated. But in the Senate youve got this rule where you got to get these days 60 votes to get something through. Just a majority doesnt seem to be enough. Meanwhile, one poll found that 63 percent of Americans support the ideas in this jobs bill. And yet 100 percent of Republicans in the Senate voted against it. Does that make any sense? AUDIENCE: No! THE PRESIDENT: Now, some people asked me yesterday why Im visiting some place in North Carolina and Virginia that are mostly Republican. (Laughter.) What I said was, Im not the Democratic President, Im not the Republican President -- Im the President. (Applause.) Im everybodys President. I don't care if youre a Republican or a Democrat. This is not the Republican jobs act, this is not called the Democratic jobs act -- this is the American Jobs Act. And everybody would be better off if we passed it. (Applause.) Now, in fairness, let me say that after I sent Congress the American Jobs Act, Republicans decided, well, wed better put out our own jobs act. So they started out calling it the ""Real American Jobs Act"" -- thats what they called it. So they don't get points for originality. (Laughter.) But lets examine what was in this jobs act. I said lets see what youve got. As it turns out, the Republicans' plan boils down to a few basic ideas, and these are ideas weve heard before. They said, were going to lower taxes for the wealthiest Americans and corporations. Were going to gut environmental regulations. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: Were going to drill more. Were going to let Wall Street do what they were doing before we got into this mess. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: And were going to repeal health care reform. AUDIENCE: No! THE PRESIDENT: All right, now, that is a plan -- but its not a jobs plan. (Applause.) Thats a plan, but its a plan to go back to doing the exact things that we were doing before we had a financial crisis that put so many people out of work. Why would we think that it would work now? I mean, lets do a little comparison-shopping here. Lets kick the tires a little bit on each plan. The Republican plan says that the only thing that's standing between us and full employment are laws that keep ours companies from polluting our air and our water. My plan says lets put teachers back in the classroom. Lets put police and firefighters back on the job. Lets hire construction workers to rebuild America. Lets put our veterans back on the job. (Applause.) Their plan says wed be better off if we kick 30 million Americans who are slated to get health care off the rolls. So the young people, for example, who are already getting health insurance by staying on their parent's plan, theyd be out of luck. I don't know how that will contribute to creating jobs. Our plan says were better off if we give a tax cut to virtually every small business and every worker in America. That's in the American Jobs Act. (Applause.) Their plan says lets go back and let Wall Street do exactly what they were doing before the financial crisis. Lets roll back all the Wall Street reforms that we fought tooth and nail to pass over the objections of lobbyists and special interests in Washington. Our plan says we need to make it easier for small businesses on Main Street to get financing and to hire and to push this economy forward. Now -- so those are the two plans. Remember those -- group of economists who said our plan would create jobs? Well, we asked one of them to take a look at the Republican plan. We said, well, maybe were missing something here. Maybe we don't understand exactly what their strategy is. So we asked independent economists, please evaluate their plan. And the economist says, well, you know what, this plan would actually cost jobs. It won't do much to help the economy right now when folks are hurting, and could actually result in fewer jobs, not more jobs. So I don't know how you present a plan for jobs that results in less jobs. (Laughter.) Right? I mean, they didn't call it the ""American No Jobs Act."" (Laughter.) So the question is, Virginia, do you want a plan that results in dirtier air and water for our kids, and fewer people on health care, and less accountability on Wall Street? AUDIENCE: No! THE PRESIDENT: Or do we want to keep pushing a plan that puts more teachers in the classroom? AUDIENCE: Yes! THE PRESIDENT: More construction workers rebuilding our schools? AUDIENCE: Yes! THE PRESIDENT: Tax cuts for small business owners and working families? AUDIENCE: Yes! THE PRESIDENT: Thats the choice that we face. And Ill let you decide which plan is the real American Jobs Act. I just want to be clear. I want desperately to work with Republicans on ways to create jobs right now. Think about it. Nobody is more interested -- other than the folks who are actually out of work -- than me in seeing this economy growing strong. Im open to any serious idea that is presented to create jobs. Just last week, Congress passed a bipartisan trade deal with Korea that will allow us to sell more American goods overseas, create more jobs here. My attitude is we're buying a whole lot of Hyundais and Kias; I want to see some Koreans buying some Fords and Chryslers and Chevys. (Applause.) I want them to buy some fine Virginia peanuts. (Applause.) I know they use peanuts over there, but I'll bet they're not as good as Virginia peanuts. (Applause and laughter.) There's some good peanuts. (Laughter.) AUDIENCE MEMBER: Emporia peanuts! (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT: So thats the kind of progress on our economy that we can keep on making, but to do so we've got to stop playing politics all the time. We cant just try to satisfy one wing of one party. Weve got to pull together, focus on creating jobs and helping the middle class right now, and helping people get into the middle class. So what I decided was lets give Congress another chance. Were going to give them another chance to listen to you, to step up to the plate, to do the right thing. We will give them another chance to do their jobs so that you can keep your job or get a job. (Laughter.) And so I was thinking about it. I was thinking, well, maybe there was just too much stuff in my bill. Maybe it was confusing to have all these component parts. So what we decided is were going to break it up into smaller pieces so that we dont confuse anybody, and let them vote on each piece one at a time. That way, you can be crystal clear on where everybody stands on the different components of the American Jobs Act. So the first vote we asked Congress to take is scheduled for later this week. And its a vote thats going to put hundreds of thousands of police back on the beat, and firefighters back on the job, and teachers back in the classroom where they belong. (Applause.) And you know why this is so important? I dont have to tell you this. We are competing against Germany and China and Korea and all these countries, and they are hiring teachers in droves. They are focused on making sure their children are topnotch in math and science and technology. And yet, here all over the country, including here in Virginia, budget cuts are forcing schools to lay off teachers in disturbing numbers. Here in Greensville County, youve lost some teachers. You could lose more if we dont pass this jobs bill, and thats not right. Its unfair to our kids. It undermines our future. We cant have other countries adding teachers to prepare their kids for the global economy while we sit by and do nothing. As one teacher down in North Carolina said, We didnt cause the poor economy -- us teachers. If anything, we built the good parts. He is right. Teachers build the good parts of our economy. They give our children a chance. (Applause.) They give young people the skills that allow them to go out and find a good job or start a business or invent a product. Our plan would mean nearly 11,000 education jobs right here in Virginia. So I need all of you to tell the Senate: Put those teachers back to work. Put those teachers back to work. Pass the jobs bill and put those teachers back to work. (Applause.) But were not going to stop with that vote. Were going to have a few more votes. Well give the Senate a chance to vote on putting unemployed construction workers back on the job. Listen, I do not want China and Germany and other countries to build the newest roads and the newest bridges and the newest airports while ours are crumbling. Farmers can't get their products to market if weve got broken-down infrastructure. Businesses can't move their products and their people if weve got infrastructure that isnt state of the art. If we don't have the best airports, if we don't have the best roads, that will hurt our economy over the long term. Think about it. We are the United States of America. People used to travel from all around the world to look at what we built -- the Hoover Dam, Golden Gate Bridge, Grand Central Station, Interstate Highway System. Now people arent coming to see what we built because they're building it over there. So what we said was, well, the American Jobs Act, lets put those construction workers back to work. Lets rebuild and make sure our bridges are safe and our roads are safe and our airports are state of the art. (Applause.) The Senate will have an opportunity to vote on that bill. Then they're going to have a chance to vote on giving unemployed Americans the support they need to get back into the workforce and build a better life - because in this country, if youre willing to work hard, you should have the chance to get ahead. (Applause.) And then were going to ask the Senate to vote on a provision that says veterans -- if you are a small business and you hire a veteran, you should get a tax break -- because I don't want folks who have sacrificed halfway around the world for our safety to come back here and not be able to find a job. (Applause.) And then were going to ask the Senate to pay for it by making sure that folks like me are paying their fair share. (Applause.) And if Im paying my fair share, then you get a tax cut or a tax break. Small businesses get a tax cut. And I have to say theres been a lot of misleading information about this, so let me just be perfectly clear here. Let me be painfully clear. (Laughter.) Just in case anybody asks you about it, what we are proposing is that the payroll tax cut that we passed in December gets extended, gets expanded, and that will mean an extra $1,500 in your pocket compared to if we do nothing. If we dont pass this bill your taxes will go up by $1,000 -- AUDIENCE: Whew! THE PRESIDENT: -- for the average family. I know -- everybody says, I dont want that. (Laughter.) And to pay for it, people like me can afford to pay a little bit more. Now, understand, were talking about the top 1, 2 percent of people at the very top of the incomes scales. And we can afford it. We dont need a tax cut. We didnt ask for a tax break. You got corporations who are getting special deals on their tax codes. They dont need a special deal. Lets give a good deal to hardworking men and women who are out there struggling to make ends meet. (Applause.) So if anybody -- if you hear anybody saying, oh, Obamas plan, hes going to raise your taxes -- tell them, no, Im going to keep your taxes low for 97, 98 percent of the American people. For the top 1, 2 percent, youll go up a little bit, but you can afford it. (Applause.) You can afford it. A fair shot for everybody. A fair share from everybody. So those are the choices that the American people are going to have to face. And those are the choices that the members of Congress are going to have to face in the coming weeks. And if they vote against taking steps that we know will put people back to work, theyre not going to have to answer to me -- theyre going to have to answer to you. (Applause.) Theyre going to have to come down to Virginia and tell their kids why they cant have their teachers back. Theyre going to have to look those construction workers in the eye and say why we shouldn't rebuild America. Theyre going to have to explain to working families why their taxes are going up, while the taxes of well-to-do people keep on going down. So thats where you come in. I need your voices heard. I need you to give Congress a piece of your mind. Tell these members of Congress theyre supposed to be working for you -- (applause) -- not working for special interests, not working for campaign contributions. Theyre working for you, the American people. And they need to deliver, because theyre not delivering right now. (Applause.) You've got to get on the phone -- you got to get on the phone and write letters and pay visits and tweet -- (laughter) -- whatever you do, and remind your elected leaders to do the right thing. Tell them what's at stake. Remind them that No, we cant is not a good motto. ""No, we can't"" is not how we get through tough times. That's not how -- this is a country that's gone through a Revolutionary War. This is a country that's gone through a Civil War. This is a country that went through two World Wars, a Great Depression -- and we didn't just fold, we didn't just give up. Our grandparents, our great-grandparents, they didn't just say, ""No, we can't."" They didn't say, ""This is too hard."" They didn't say, ""We give up."" They didn't settle on the status quo. They rolled up their sleeves. They went after it. They said, ""America can do whatever we put our minds to when we are unified."" (Applause.) President Kennedy didnt look up at the moon and say Oh, that's too far! We can't go there. He said, ""We can make it."" And we did -- because that's the American spirit when it is unleashed. I know we've been going through tough times. But that's not an excuse for us to just sit back. That should be a motivation for us to try that much harder. (Applause.) There are too many of our fellow Americans who are hurting too bad for us to just sit by and do nothing. Now is the time for us to act. Now is the time for us to say, Yes, we can. (Applause.) We don't sit back and do nothing when things aren't right. We set our minds to it and we fix it. We make things work. We stick with it. And thats the spirit we've got to bring right now. So I just want to say to all of you, Virginia, I hope -- I hope and I pray that all of us can get together and stay focused on what it takes to continue to make this a great nation. (Applause.) I don't want us to be playing politics all the time. I want us to meet this moment. I want us to get to work. And I want us to show the world once again why the United States of America is the greatest nation on Earth. Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

22282,"No, We Cant? Or Wont?","Excuse No. 2: Fear the bond market. Two years ago The Wall Street Journal declared that interest rates on United States debt would soon soar unless Washington stopped trying to fight the economic slump. Ever since, warnings about the imminent attack of the bond vigilantes have been used to attack any spending on job creation. But basic economics said that rates would stay low as long as the economy was depressed  and basic economics was right. The interest rate on 10-year bonds was 3.7 percent when The Wall Street Journal issued that warning; at the end of last week it was 3.03 percent. How have the usual suspects responded? By inventing their own reality. Last week, Representative Paul Ryan, the man behind the G.O.P. plan to dismantle Medicare , declared that we must slash government spending to take pressure off the interest rates  the same pressure, I suppose, that has pushed those rates to near-record lows. Photo Excuse No. 3: Its the workers fault. Unemployment soared during the financial crisis and its aftermath. So it seems bizarre to argue that the real problem lies with the workers  that the millions of Americans who were working four years ago but arent working now somehow lack the skills the economy needs. Yet thats what you hear from many pundits these days: high unemployment is structural, they say, and requires long-term solutions (which means, in practice, doing nothing).

Well, if there really was a mismatch between the workers we have and the workers we need, workers who do have the right skills, and are therefore able to find jobs, should be getting big wage increases. They arent. In fact, average wages actually fell last month. Excuse No. 4: We tried to stimulate the economy, and it didnt work. Everybody knows that President Obama tried to stimulate the economy with a huge increase in government spending, and that it didnt work. But what everyone knows is wrong. Think about it: Where are the big public works projects? Where are the armies of government workers? There are actually half a million fewer government employees now than there were when Mr. Obama took office. Advertisement Continue reading the main story So what happened to the stimulus? Much of it consisted of tax cuts, not spending. Most of the rest consisted either of aid to distressed families or aid to hard-pressed state and local governments. This aid may have mitigated the slump, but it wasnt the kind of job-creation program we could and should have had. This isnt 20-20 hindsight: some of us warned from the beginning that tax cuts would be ineffective and that the proposed spending was woefully inadequate. And so it proved. Its also worth noting that in another area where government could make a big difference  help for troubled homeowners  almost nothing has been done. The Obama administrations program of mortgage relief has gone nowhere: of $46 billion allotted to help families stay in their homes, less than $2 billion has actually been spent. So lets summarize: The economy isnt fixing itself. Nor are there real obstacles to government action: both the bond vigilantes and structural unemployment exist only in the imaginations of pundits. And if stimulus seems to have failed, its because it was never actually tried. Listening to what supposedly serious people say about the economy, youd think the problem was no, we cant. But the reality is no, we wont.

22284,Allen and Kaine Campaign in Crozet on Foot and Horseback,"Two former governors are going head-to-head Saturday in some good old fashioned parade politicking. George Allen and Tim Kaine campaigned for support from voters in Crozet in the race for a US Senate seat in 2012. The two former governors had plenty of good things to say about Crozet, but also some tough words about the battles ahead in Washington. Democrat Tim Kaine shook hands as he walked the Crozet Avenue parade with fellow party members. Republican George Allen was a little further back in the line-up. And he didn't walk, Allen saddled up on a horse and rode the parade route. But both candidates are talking about the lack of compromise between congressional Republicans and President Obama over raising the debt ceiling. ""Tax increases would be the exact worst thing to do with this economy. My view is we ought to be reducing taxes on job creating businesses,"" said Allen. Kaine stated, ""The notion of just cutting spending means cutting veterans benefits and cutting social security and cutting medicare and medicaid. Those things wouldn't help the economy."" The president has said if a deal can't be reached by August 2 the nation would default on its loans, potentially crushing the economy. Both sides have vastly different views on how to create more jobs. Allen says we need more tax cuts, while Kaine maintains, it didn't work when Allen was governor and it won't work in Washington.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2011/jul/08/george-allen/allen-says-china-owns-more-us-bonds-americans/,Economy,Polifact
22310,That cookout will cost you 29% more this year,"The kabobs arent the only things getting skewered at this years Memorial Day barbecue. Hosts of the traditional holiday backyard cookout  even a budget affair  can expect to shell out an extra $45 for the fixings to serve a dozen. The souped-up total comes to $199, about 29 percent more than it cost last year  and that doesnt include soda, beer or booze. According to the latest inflation data for metro New York, food cost hikes are popping up just in time to spoil the annual holiday that marks the start of summer and salutes fallen heroes who helped make America the land of plenty. Gasolines 44 percent hike at the pumps this past year, along with similar diesel spikes, are squeezing industries and agriculture equally, said regional economist Martin Kohli of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Analysts said growers and food markets can no longer afford to soak up the rising costs and are passing them on to consumers at the fastest pace in several years. Since last Memorial Day, lettuce for that cookout hamburger has climbed 28 percent while a 20-cent ear of sweet corn on the cob is now 50 cents. Want tomatoes on that burger? Itll cost you 86 percent more than last year. Growers, meanwhile, are abandoning usual crops of grains and vegetables in favor of loading acres with corn for ethanol in gasoline blends. A record 43 percent of the US corn crop went into gas tanks in 2010, or about 810 billion pounds, with next years gas-tank crop forecast at 1 trillion pounds, said the US Department of Agriculture. Consumers have already cut back to make up for gas pump excesses, but cant exactly dodge the barbecue bubble with cheaper menus. The 29-percent jump in the cookout is based on a modest menu of ground beef burgers, ordinary franks, side dishes of potato salad, lettuce and tomatoes, and a dessert of supermarket ice cream. Coffee, which is up 20 percent, is included. Propane is 20 percent higher here and the price of gas at the pump to get you to the store to buy all the goodies  well, you know how much that costs these days. _EMAIL_",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/27/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-food-prices-barbecues-29-per/,Economy,Polifact
22348,Rule by Rentiers,"Of course, thats not the way what I call the Pain Caucus makes its case. Instead, the argument against helping the unemployed is framed in terms of economic risks: Do anything to create jobs and interest rates will soar, runaway inflation will break out, and so on. But these risks keep not materializing. Interest rates remain near historic lows, while inflation outside the price of oil  which is determined by world markets and events, not U.S. policy  remains low. Photo And against these hypothetical risks one must set the reality of an economy that remains deeply depressed, at great cost both to todays workers and to our nations future. After all, how can we expect to prosper two decades from now when millions of young graduates are, in effect, being denied the chance to get started on their careers? Ask for a coherent theory behind the abandonment of the unemployed and you wont get an answer. Instead, members of the Pain Caucus seem to be making it up as they go along, inventing ever-changing rationales for their never-changing policy prescriptions . While the ostensible reasons for inflicting pain keep changing, however, the policy prescriptions of the Pain Caucus all have one thing in common: They protect the interests of creditors, no matter the cost. Deficit spending could put the unemployed to work  but it might hurt the interests of existing bondholders. More aggressive action by the Fed could help boost us out of this slump  in fact, even Republican economists have argued that a bit of inflation might be exactly what the doctor ordered  but deflation , not inflation, serves the interests of creditors. And, of course, theres fierce opposition to anything smacking of debt relief. Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Not hard-working, thrifty small business owners and workers, although it serves the interests of the big players to pretend that its all about protecting little guys who play by the rules. The reality is that both small businesses and workers are hurt far more by the weak economy than they would be by, say, modest inflation that helps promote recovery. No, the only real beneficiaries of Pain Caucus policies (aside from the Chinese government) are the rentiers: bankers and wealthy individuals with lots of bonds in their portfolios. And that explains why creditor interests bulk so large in policy; not only is this the class that makes big campaign contributions, its the class that has personal access to policy makers  many of whom go to work for these people when they exit government through the revolving door. The process of influence doesnt have to involve raw corruption (although that happens, too). All it requires is the tendency to assume that whats good for the people you hang out with, the people who seem so impressive in meetings  hey, theyre rich, theyre smart, and they have great tailors  must be good for the economy as a whole. But the reality is just the opposite: creditor-friendly policies are crippling the economy. This is a negative-sum game, in which the attempt to protect the rentiers from any losses is inflicting much larger losses on everyone else.

22465,"Remarks by the President at a DNC Event in Austin, Texas","Austin, Texas Please see below for a correction (marked with asterisks) to the transcript. Internationally, weve gone through a **Teutonic [tectonic] shift in the Middle East that could have enormous ramifications for years to come. And in addition to these crises, we have had to grapple with some ongoing trends in this country that, frankly, have made America less competitive, less just, less equitable -- all the things that we talked about during the course of 2007 and 2008. May 10, 2011 7:18 P.M. CDT THE PRESIDENT: Let me, first of all -- I'd like to hire Alexa as my speechwriter. (Laughter.) I don't usually get such elegant introductions. And I'm so grateful to her and Blaine and the kids for opening up this gorgeous home. And I mentioned to Alexa that I do have a doctor with me at all times -- (laughter) -- so just in case the new one shows up early, we've got it under control. (Laughter.) We've got it under control. Hey, we're prepared for every situation. (Laughter.) To the hosts who helped to set this up, thank you so much. You guys have been great friends for a long time. And I was just at Austin City Limits, an extraordinary venue. And I told folks what is the truth, which is I just love Austin, Texas. (Applause.) I get a good vibe coming to Austin. So, post-presidency, if I decide to come back and theres not a strong candidate for mayor -- (laughter and applause) -- you never know. I'm a football fan, too. (Laughter.) I want to be brief because I want to spend as much time as possible answering questions, and then I want to come to each table and make sure I say thank you personally. Obviously we've had an eventful week, in an eventful month and an eventful couple of years. We knew when many of you got involved in the campaign back in 2008 that the country was at a crossroads and we were going to have to make some fairly consequential decisions to make sure that we were passing on a country that was worthy of its ideals. I don't think we fully realized how dramatic some of the changes would be as we came into office. We inherited the worst recession since the Great Depression, a banking system on the verge of meltdown. We had lost 4 million jobs by the time I was sworn in and would then lose another 4 million in the few months right after I was sworn in before our economic policies had a chance to take root. Internationally, weve gone through a **Teutonic [tectonic] shift in the Middle East that could have enormous ramifications for years to come. And in addition to these crises, we have had to grapple with some ongoing trends in this country that, frankly, have made America less competitive, less just, less equitable -- all the things that we talked about during the course of 2007 and 2008. Now, and I haven't even mentioned pirates -- (laughter) -- earthquakes and the H1N1 scare. So you guys have just forgotten all this stuff. (Laughter.) But I'm keeping a tally. (Laughter.) Despite crises large and small, whats been extraordinary is the progress that we've been able to make. And I could not be prouder of my team, but most importantly, I couldnt be prouder of my supporters whove hung in there during these very tumultuous times. But think about it. We saved the country from a Great Depression. An economy that was shrinking by about 6 percent in the first quarter that I came in is now growing fairly steadily. Over the last 14 months we've added over 2 million new jobs in the private sector here in the United States of America. Some things that folks thought would not work like saving the auto industry have worked. And so not only are the Big 3 automakers back all the workers that were about to be laid off. So that's about a million jobs saved all turning a profit, in some cases, the first profit theyve seen in a decade, but theyve now hired back all the workers that were about to be laid off. So that's about a million jobs saved just from those efforts on that front. We managed a banking crisis in a way that taxpayers are basically getting paid almost every dime back from the interventions that we entered into. Along the way we passed historic health care reform that had eluded us for a hundred years -- (applause) -- and we passed financial regulatory reform. We made sure that people who love their country can serve regardless of their sexual orientation by overturning ""don't ask, don't tell."" (Applause.) Got a couple of tough women on the Supreme Court, including the first Latina. (Applause.) We passed equal pay for equal work legislation. We made the largest investment in education in our history, but didnt just put more money in, initiating unprecedented reforms that are having ramifications all across the country. We made the largest investment in clean energy in our history, and have created entire new industries, like the advanced battery manufacturing industry here in the United States of America, where we look like we'll have close to a 40-percent share of the market in the next few years. Doubled our exports. Ended a war, as promised, and are working another war in a place where we're going to start drawing down our troops this year and are in a position to help Afghans secure their own country. So I'm realty proud of what we've gotten done. But we've got so much more to do. We have so much more to do. And in an era where everybody wants instant gratification and people are very, very impatient, the fact of the matter is that some of these changes are going to take time. Right now probably the thing that folks are most worried about around the country -- and rightfully so because it directly hinges on every aspect of our lives -- are gas prices. We don't have a silver bullet for gas prices. The way we're going to bring gas prices down is do some of the things that we've already done -- increasing fuel-efficiency standards on cars and trucks, and start developing new sources of energy and promoting electric vehicles. But its going to take some time. We're going to have to be able to sustain that effort over the next several years. Internationally, whats happening in the Middle East is a opportunity because, frankly, it was a very dangerous situation for us to rely on a handful of autocrats to maintain stability in the region. And now we have the possibility of democracy and opportunity, but there are also enormous dangers. And how that plays itself out is going to require steady leadership over the next several years. With respect to the economy, it is still changing in profound ways and the unemployment rate remains way too high. And the only way we are going to make sure that we drive that unemployment rate down, but more importantly, we start driving wages and incomes back up, is if the changes we're making in education, the changes that need to be made in terms of ensuring that we have an investment in innovation and basic research that allows us to maintain our cutting edge, making sure we get a handle on our deficit in a way that reflects our values -- that's going to take some time. Its going to require work. And so that's why your presence here tonight is so important, because the main thing I want to communicate to you is not only do I think we are going to win, but also I think that whats at stake is not just Democrats being in power versus Republicans; its not just a matter of winning or losing. Whats at stake is our ability to maintain a course that keeps us headed in the right direction for decades to come. Ill just focus on this budget issue just for one second, and then what I want to do is open it up for questions. When I came in I had sort of wrapped in a nice bow a trillion dollar deficit -- (laughter) -- welcoming me. And we had accumulated trillions of dollars of debt from the previous years. This had been building up over a decade as a consequence of the Bush tax cuts, two wars that weren't paid for, and a prescription drug plan that was very expensive but not paid for either. We then added about a trillion dollars as a consequence of reduced revenues and increased expenditures to make sure the states, for example, got help balancing their budgets, increased demand on things like unemployment insurance, and making sure that we were putting some folks back to work in this country. We now have to get our fiscal situation under control. The debate is not just about numbers. Its about who are we, what do we believe. And the debate that we're having now in Washington is actually very instructive and I'm glad we're having it, because Paul Ryan put forward a budget that is reflective, it is sort of the logical conclusion to the Republican argument that's been going on for a number of years. And essentially what theyre talking about is cutting education by 25 percent, cutting transportation spending by 30 percent, cutting clean energy investments by 70 percent, voucherizing Medicare, slashing Medicaid -- fundamentally reworking our social compact. And the consequences are not just that senior citizens would have $6,000 more in Medicare expenses every year. Its not just that a bunch of poor kids or seniors who are in nursing homes or families who have an autistic child would suddenly be without help. Even for those of us who are doing well, the consequences would be that -- let me just take the example of transportation. Think about cutting transportation spending by 30 percent, at a time when the National Association of Engineers gives us a D in infrastructure. We've got China and India and Europe building brand new trains and bridges and ports, and we can barely fill our potholes. And so the prospect would be a diminished, smaller, less compassionate America, and a less competitive America. And that's not the vision I want for our children. I think we're better than that. That's not who we are. And as I said at Austin City Limits, that's not because I'm particularly worried about how Malia or Sasha are going to do. Our kids will be fine. But what kind of country do we want them to live in? Do we want a country that has sort of the equivalent -- when it comes to our infrastructure, our social safety net, the equivalent of what used to be known as third world countries? How can we look them in the eye and tell them we're passing on to you the same kind of extraordinary country that we inherited when we are shrinking our vision, our sights, in that way? That's what this is about. That's what this election is going to be about. Now, its going to be tough because -- I think most people are not sold on the other folks ideas. They know they don't work. But theyre worried that we have not made as much progress as quickly as they want. And that always creates volatility when it comes to the electorate. But as I'm going around the country and talking to people, I can tell you the basic impulses of the American people, their values are strong, they are resilient, theyve got good instincts. And as long as we're able to get out there and deliver our message, I'm confident we're going to be able to see this thing through. Last weekend, obviously, Sunday was a big moment for the country, thanks to the extraordinary work of our men and women in uniform and our intelligence folks. And I visited Ground Zero, and some of you may have seen -- there were some young girls there who were standing behind me when I put the wreath down. One of the young ladies was 13. She had written me a letter on Monday, an email, that I received so I invited her to the ceremony. Her father had been in the Twin Towers when the planes hit them. And she was 4 years old at the time. And she remembers her mom picking up the phone on that spectacular September day, and suddenly starting to sob on the phone, and then her mother handing her the phone, and her father say, I love you and I'll always be looking after you. And then the phone went dead. And her mother and her witnessed the buildings go down and her father die. And she talked about how haunted she was by that memory, and described powerfully how sometimes she worries that she can't remember what her father looks like or the sound of his voice, and how much it meant that justice was done. And I think about her and when I met her, she couldn't have been more poised and charming and smart and ready for the future. And I thought, that's who we are. We take our licks, but we keep on going. And I want to make sure that our government is reflective of that. And I promise you I will make sure that our campaign is reflective of that spirit. And with all of your help, I'm confident that we're going to be able to keep on moving forward and deliver the kind of future for that young lady and all of our children and our grandchildren that they deserve. So thank you very much, everybody. (Applause.) END 7:35 P.M.

22475,Let's Harness American Energy To Lower Gas Prices And Create Jobs,"Like many Ohioans, I experienced sticker shock today when I filled up at our neighborhood gas station outside Cincinnati. Regular unleaded was $3.79 a gallon. Some Ohioans are already seeing gas prices over four dollars per gallon, and higher prices may be on the horizon. This makes it more expensive to commute, drive to the store or take a vacation. Because oil fuels every major sector of our economy, rising gas prices have a less visible, but no less costly, impact on all of us. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, 94 percent of all consumer goods and 68 percent of all farm goods are transported over Americas roads. As the cost of shipping and producing goods increases, we will find ourselves paying more for everything from groceries to electronics. Oil prices are on the rise for a host of reasons. As the global economy slowly recovers, demand for oil is rising to meet new manufacturing and other needs. The laws of supply and demand kick in. Unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, including oil-rich Libya, has also injected uncertainty into the energy markets, which results in price hikes. Some experts also suggest that the oil market is factoring in expected inflation due to global deficit spending, especially the record federal government debt in the United States. Still others point to the actions of speculators and their illegal actions driving up the cost of oil. The Obama Administration recently announced the formation of a new task force to look at fraud and manipulation within oil and energy markets. Any price fixing or other illegal activity should be prosecuted. But I don't think we need a task force to tell us what we need to do as a country to respond to yet another spike in oil prices: we need to move aggressively to get away from our dependence on foreign oil and this must include using more of our own resources. For decades, Washington, D.C. has been unwilling to tap the energy resources in our own backyard. This policy simply makes no sense in the worlds largest oil-consuming nation. The United States today consumes about 22 percent of the worlds oil supply  much of it from countries hostile to American interests and ideals. Last year alone, we spent $337 billion on oil imports, more than half of what we spent on our nations defense, and we have not been self-sufficient in energy production since 1970. There is a better way to power Americas economic future. What we need are common-sense solutions to strengthen U.S. energy production. That begins with harnessing the potential of our own natural resources in an environmentally responsible way. As an immediate bridge, we should increase access for oil exploration and production in energy-rich areas of the country like the Outer Continental Shelf, and in parts of Alaska. This will create jobs, drive investment, and immediately reduce our dangerous dependence on foreign oil. We must also look to alternatives to oil, recognizing that true innovation will come from private-sector entrepreneurs, engineers, and scientists  not from the Washington bureaucracy. Thats why it is critical to eliminate unnecessary rules and regulations that slow the development of cleaner, more affordable energy. Less red tape will free businesses to grow, innovate, and create new jobs. The good news is that Ohio is poised help lead Americas energy future. Ohio has a long history of producing its own energy sources, with an oil, gas, and coal business that pre-dates the Civil War. Today, Ohio is preparing for a natural gas shale revolution  a new means of tapping energy-rich underground rock formations. Considering the potential of the Marcellus and Utica Shale Formations, we have the possibility of creating good Ohio jobs while providing Ohioans with access to large quantities of cleaner-burning natural gas that can be used today for buses, taxis and other fleets and could be used for cars in the future. Where natural gas is used for transportation fuel today, the average cost per gallon is less than $2.00. These new breakthroughs in Ohio energy production can build on the longstanding strength of our Ohio coal industry. Coal is a proven source of relatively inexpensive energy that supports thousands of jobs across Ohio. Clean coal technology continues to develop, and, with the help of research being done at Ohio's Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, coal-to-liquid could become another affordable domestic alternative to oil. Ohio also continues to be a leading producer of bio-fuels. We currently have five operating plants, producing 424 million gallons of ethanol annually and contributing hundreds of jobs and millions of dollars of economic activity to Ohios rural economy. Research and new cellulosic ethanol technologies are making home-grown Ohio bio-fuels more cost-effective and should be encouraged through further research and investments. Ohio is also a leader on fuel cell research and other clean technologies to power the cars of the future. As these examples show, America has the know-how and the natural abundance to move toward a future of energy independence. But we must make the right choices today. It is time to unleash the ingenuity of our workforce and the potential of our energy resources to power the American economy and create new jobs  with Ohio leading the way.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2011/may/04/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-easing-access-drilling-would-/,Economy,Polifact

""Medicare is an issue that we absolutely have to deal with,"" said Ellmers, who is a nurse. ""If we do not address Medicare as it is, it will not be there for myself, it will not be there for our children or our grandchildren."" Walsh said Republicans are leading on entitlement reform regardless of the political fallout, and that they have pushed President Obama to match their proposals. ""The President of the United States ought to be ashamed of himself. Two months ago he presents a budget and doesn't even talk about entitlement reform,"" Walsh said.

22608,Florida Governor Scott to Help Share a Little Sunshine,"Leads team of Sunshine Ambassadors on four-city tour to invite winter-weary northerners to the Sunshine State Feb 28 2011; Tallahassee, FL  After a brutally harsh winter for many Americans, Florida Governor Rick Scott and VISIT FLORIDA, the states official tourism marketing corporation, have organized the Share a Little Sunshine Tour to invite those hit hardest by this years unseasonably cold weather to defrost in sunny Florida. Governor Scott and the rest of the Sunshine Ambassadors will start their two-day tour March 1 in Orlando and make stops in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, New York City and Chicago. When the whirlwind tour ends in the Windy City, 120 lucky winners will board a chartered plane and return to Orlando with the Governor to take a much-needed break from the worst winter many have seen in decades. Jobs and economic development are two of the most important issues we face as a state and a nation, said Florida Governor Rick Scott. Tourism is an important economic engine for Florida and employs nearly one million residents, I am proud to lead VISIT FLORIDAs Share a Little Sunshine campaign to bring more visitors to the Sunshine State. We know that every 85 visitors create one Florida job, so I urge all Floridians to join with me in supporting this effort to increase jobs and grow the states economy. Residents and fans can be part of the Share a Little Sunshine campaign by visiting ShareALittleSunshine.org to send a personalized e-postcard inviting someone to Florida. They can also post photos and comments, find Sunshine Deals and share Florida travel information by joining the nearly 25,000 followers of Share a Little Sunshine on Facebook at facebook.com/FloridaSunshine. As the No. 1 industry in the state, tourism is big business in Florida  there are more people visiting the Sunshine State on any given day than live in twelve U.S. states. In fact, tourism is so significant that it generates more than one fifth of the states sales tax revenue. We are grateful that the Governor continues to acknowledge the importance of tourism to the states economy by participating in this fast-paced, fun-filled tour of several of Floridas key visitor markets, said Ed Fouch, Chairman of the VISIT FLORIDA Board of Directors and Senior Vice PresidentTravel Industry Sales for Disney Destinations. The tour begins on March 1 at 8:30 a.m. with a rally at the UCF Rosen College of Hospitality Management in Orlando. The public is invited to attend the event where Governor Scott, VISIT FLORIDA, Visit Orlando, the Partnership for Floridas Tourism and others will be encouraging residents to participate in VISIT FLORIDAs Share a Little Sunshine program by sending personal invitations to their out-of-state friends and family to visit the Sunshine State. The rally will conclude with a send-off for Governor Scott, who will lead the charge as the team takes off for its first stop in Washington, D.C., speaking to potential visitors and awarding great Florida vacation prizes along the way. The Share a Little Sunshine campaign was created as a fun, easy way for residents to invite friends and family to Florida, and having Governor Scott take time to extend a personal invitation to everyone he meets on this tour to visit the Sunshine State takes the program to a whole new level, said Chris Thompson, President and CEO of VISIT FLORIDA. We know this has been an extremely difficult winter for many around the country, so were happy to be sharing a little sunshine with our neighbors to the north. Throughout the two-day tour, Governor Scott and the rest of the Sunshine State squad will be hosting special events and giving away Florida vacation packages to promotion winners. The tour concludes on March 2 at Midway Airport in Chicago as the Governor escorts a plane full of prize winners who will depart that evening for a four-day stay in Orlando. Southwest Airlines, Walt Disney World and dozens of other VISIT FLORIDA partners have come together to help create the vacation packages being given away to winners in each market. So many organizations have come together to help VISIT FLORIDA make this tour a reality, said Will Seccombe, Chief Marketing Officer for VISIT FLORIDA. I would especially like to thank our Florida tourism industry partners and trade associations, without whose efforts this event would not have been possible. ### En Espaol",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2011/mar/10/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-says-every-85-tourists-one-job-crea/,Economy,Polifact

Even a casual observer of American public life knows how many great ideas have been born here, how many important debates joined here, how many giants of our democracy appeared on this platform. When David broached the invitation, my first reaction was one I often have: Who cancelled? But first choice or fifteenth, the honor, and the responsibility to do the occasion justice, is the same. I am seized with the sentiment best expressed by Hizzoner, the original Mayor Richard Daley, who once proclaimed a similar honor the pinochle of success. We are all grateful to our co-sponsors, the Reagan Foundation and the Reagan Ranch. How fitting that we convene under their auspices, as we close this first week of the centennial. Those of us who served President Reagan were taught to show constant respect for the presidency and whoever occupies it. But, among us alums, the term the President tends to connote just one of those forty-four men, that great man with whom God blessed America one hundred years ago this week. The prefix in co-sponsor is meaningful tonight. It is no state secret that the two foundations have not always been co-operative, or co-llaborative, or co-llegial. So it is a tribute to the stature and diplomacy of David Keene that they have come together to produce so warm a moment as this. I am now converted to the view that yes, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will be solved. Well done, David; Nobel Peace Prizes have been awarded for far less. I bring greetings from a place called Indiana. The coastal types present may think of it as a flyover state, or one of those I states. Perhaps a quick anthropological summary would help. We Hoosiers hold to some quaint notions. Some might say we cling to them, though not out of fear or ignorance. We believe in paying our bills. We have kept our state in the black throughout the recent unpleasantness, while cutting rather than raising taxes, by practicing an old tribal ritual  we spend less money than we take in. We believe it wrong ever to take a dollar from a free citizen without a very necessary public purpose, because each such taking diminishes the freedom to spend that dollar as its owner would prefer. When we do find it necessary, we feel a profound duty to use that dollar as carefully and effectively as possible, else we should never have taken it at all. Before our General Assembly now is my proposal for an automatic refund of tax dollars beyond a specified level of state reserves. We say that anytime budgets are balanced and an ample savings account has been set aside, government should just stop collecting taxes. Better to leave that money in the pockets of those who earned it, than to let it burn a hole, as it always does, in the pockets of government. We believe that government works for the benefit of private life, and not the other way around. We see governments mission as fostering and enabling the important realms  our businesses, service clubs, Little Leagues, churches  to flourish. Our first thought is always for those on lifes first rung, and how we might increase their chances of climbing. Every day, we work to lower the costs and barriers to free men and women creating wealth for each other. We build roads, and bridges, and new sources of homegrown energy at record rates, in order to have the strongest possible backbone to which people of enterprise can attach their investments and build their dreams. When business leaders ask me what they can do for Indiana, I always reply: Make money. Go make money. Thats the first act of corporate citizenship. If you do that, youll have to hire someone else, and youll have enough profit to help one of those non-profits were so proud of. We place our trust in average people. We are confident in their ability to decide wisely for themselves, on the important matters of their lives. So when we cut property taxes, to the lowest level in America, we left flexibility for localities to raise them, but only by securing the permission of their taxpayers, voting in referendum. We designed both our state employee health plans and the one we created for low-income Hoosiers as Health Savings Accounts, and now in the tens of thousands these citizens are proving that they are fully capable of making smart, consumerist choices about their own health care. We have broadened the right of parents to select the best place for their childrens education to include every public school, traditional or charter, regardless of geography, tuition-free. And before our current legislature adjourns, we intend to become the first state of full and true choice by saying to every low and middle-income Hoosier family, if you think a non-government school is the right one for your child, youre as entitled to that option as any wealthy family; heres a voucher, go sign up. Lastly, speaking now for my administration colleagues, we believe in government that is limited but active. Within that narrow sphere of legitimate collective action, we choose to be the initiators of new ideas or, as we have labeled ourselves, the Party of Purpose. In President Reagans phrase, We are the change. On election nights, we remind each other that victory is not a vindication, it is an instruction, not an endorsement, but an assignment. The national elections of 2010 carried an instruction. In our nation, in our time, the friends of freedom have an assignment, as great as those of the 1860s, or the 1940s, or the long twilight of the Cold War. As in those days, the American project is menaced by a survival-level threat. We face an enemy, lethal to liberty, and even more implacable than those America has defeated before. We cannot deter it; there is no countervailing danger we can pose. We cannot negotiate with it, any more than with an iceberg or a Great White. I refer, of course, to the debts our nation has amassed for itself over decades of indulgence. It is the new Red Menace, this time consisting of ink. We can debate its origins endlessly and search for villains on ideological grounds, but the reality is pure arithmetic. No enterprise, small or large, public or private, can remain self-governing, let alone successful, so deeply in hock to others as we are about to be. Need I illustrate? Surely the consequences, to prosperity, world influence, and personal freedom itself are as clear to this audience as to any one could appear before. Do I exaggerate? Id love to be shown that I do. Any who think so please see me in the hallway afterward, and bring your third grade math books. If a foreign power advanced an army to the border of our land, everyone in this room would drop everything and look for a way to help. We would set aside all other agendas and disputes as secondary, and go to the ramparts until the threat was repelled. That is what those of us here, and every possible ally we can persuade to join us, are now called to do. It is our generational assignment. It is the mission of our era. Forgive the pun when I call it our raison debt. Every conflict has its draft dodgers. There are those who will not enlist with us. Some who can accept, or even welcome, the ballooning of the state, regardless of the cost in dollars, opportunity, or liberty, and the slippage of the United States into a gray parity with the other nations of this earth. Some who sincerely believe that history has devised a leftward ratchet, moving in fits and starts but always in the direction of a more powerful state. The people who coined the smug and infuriating term  have you heard it?  the Reagan Interruption. The task of such people is now a simple one. They need only play good defense. The federal spending commitments now in place will bring about the leviathan state they have always sought. The health care travesty now on the books will engulf private markets and produce a single-payer system or its equivalent, and it wont take long to happen. Our fiscal ruin and resulting loss of world leadership will, in their eyes, be not a tragic event but a desirable one, delivering the multilateral world of which theyve dreamed so long. Fortunately, these folks remain few. They are vastly outnumbered by Americans who sense the presence of the enemy, but are awaiting the call for volunteers, and a credible battle plan for saving our Republic. That call must come from this room, and rooms like it. But we, too, are relatively few in number, in a nation of 300 million. If freedoms best friends cannot unify around a realistic, actionable program of fundamental change, one that attracts and persuades a broad majority of our fellow citizens, big change will not come. Or rather, big change will come, of the kind that the skeptics of all centuries have predicted for those nave societies that believed that government of and by the people could long endure. We know what the basic elements must be. An affectionate thank you to the major social welfare programs of the last century, but their sunsetting when those currently or soon to be enrolled have passed off the scene. The creation of new Social Security and Medicare compacts with the young people who will pay for their elders and who deserve to have a backstop available to them in their own retirement. These programs should reserve their funds for those most in need of them. They should be updated to catch up to Americans increasing longevity and good health. They should protect benefits against inflation but not overprotect them. Medicare 2.0 should restore to the next generation the dignity of making their own decisions, by delivering its dollars directly to the individual, based on financial and medical need, entrusting and empowering citizens to choose their own insurance and, inevitably, pay for more of their routine care like the discerning, autonomous consumers we know them to be. Our morbidly obese federal government needs not just behavior modification but bariatric surgery. The perverse presumption that places the burden of proof on the challenger of spending must be inverted, back to the rule that applies elsewhere in life: Prove to me why we should. Lost to history is the fact that, in my OMB assignment, I was the first loud critic of Congressional earmarks. I was also the first to get absolutely nowhere in reducing them: first to rail and first to fail. They are a pernicious practice and should be stopped. But, in the cause of national solvency, they are a trifle. Talking much more about them, or waste, fraud, and abuse, trivializes what needs to be done, and misleads our fellow citizens to believe that easy answers are available to us. In this room, we all know how hard the answers are, how much change is required. And that means nothing, not even the first and most important mission of government, our national defense, can get a free pass. I served in two administrations that practiced and validated the policy of peace through strength. It has served America and the world with irrefutable success. But if our nation goes over a financial Niagara, we wont have much strength and, eventually, we wont have peace. We are currently borrowing the entire defense budget from foreign investors. Within a few years, we will be spending more on interest payments than on national security. That is not, as our military friends say, a robust strategy. I personally favor restoring impoundment power to the presidency, at least on an emergency basis. Having had this authority the last six years, and used it shall we say with vigor, I can testify to its effectiveness, and to this finding: Youd be amazed how much government youll never miss. The nation must be summoned to General Quarters in the cause of economic growth. The friends of freedom always favor a growing economy as the wellspring of individual opportunity and a bulwark against a domineering state. But here, doctrinal debates are unnecessary; the arithmetic tells it all. We dont have a prayer of defeating the Red Threat of our generation without a long boom of almost unprecedented duration. Every other goal, however worthy, must be tested against and often subordinated to actions that spur the faster expansion of the private sector on which all else depends. A friend of mine attended a recent meeting of the NBA leadership, at which a small-market owner, whom I wont name but will mention is also a member of the U.S. Senate, made an impassioned plea for more sharing of revenue by the more successful teams. At a coffee break, Mr. Prokhorov, the new Russian owner of the New Jersey Nets, murmured to my friend, We tried that, you know. It doesnt work. Americans have seen these last two years what doesnt work. The failure of national economic policy is costing us more than jobs; it has begun to weaken that uniquely American spirit of risk-taking, large ambition, and optimism about the future. We must rally them now to bold departures that rebuild our national morale as well as our material prosperity. Here, too, the room abounds with experts and good ideas, and the nation will need every one. Just to name three: its time we had, in Bill Simons words a tax system that looks like someone designed it on purpose. And the purpose should be private growth. So lower and flatter, and completely flat is best. Tax compensation but not the savings and investment without which the economy cannot boom. Second, untie Gulliver. The regulatory rainforest through which our enterprises must hack their way is blighting the future of millions of Americans. Todays EPA should be renamed the Employment Prevention Agency. After a two-year orgy of new regulation, President Obamas recent executive order was a wonderment, as though the number one producer of rap music had suddenly expressed alarm about obscenity. In Indiana, where our privatization of a toll road generated billions for reinvestment in infrastructure, we can build in half the time at two-thirds the cost when we use our own money only and are free from the federal rulebook. A moratorium on new regulation is a minimal suggestion; better yet, move at least temporarily to a self-certification regime that lets America build, and expand, and explore now and settle up later in those few instances where someone colors outside the lines. Finally, treat domestic energy production as the economic necessity it is and the job creator it can be. Drill, and frack, and lease, and license, unleash in every way the jobs potential in the enormous energy resources we have been denying ourselves. And help our fellow citizens to understand that a poorer country will not be a greener country, but its opposite. It is freedom and its fruits that enable the steady progress we have made in preserving and protecting Gods kingdom. If this strikes you as a project of unusual ambition, given the state of modern politics, you are right. If it strikes you as too bold for our fellow Americans to embrace, I believe you are wrong. Seven years as a practitioner in elective politics tells me that historys skeptics are wrong. That Americans, in a vast majority, are still a people born for self-governance. They are ready to summon the discipline to pay down our collective debts as they are now paying down their own; to put the future before the present, their childrens interest before their own. Our proposals will be labeled radical, but this is easy to rebut. Starting a new retirement plan for those below a certain age is something tens of millions of Americans have already been through at work. Opponents will expect us to be defensive, but they have it backwards. When they call the slightest spending reductions painful, we will say If government spending prevents pain, why are we suffering so much of it? And If you want to experience real pain, just stay on the track we are on. When they attack us for our social welfare reforms, we will say that the true enemies of Social Security and Medicare are those who defend an imploding status quo, and the arithmetic backs us up. They will attack our program as the way of despair, but we will say no, Americas way forward is brilliant with hope, as soon as we have dealt decisively with the manageable problems before us. 2010 showed that the spirit of liberty and independence is stirring anew, that a growing number of Americans still hear Lincolns mystic chords of memory. But their number will have to grow, and do so swiftly. Change of the dimension we need requires a coalition of a dimension no one has recently assembled. And, unless you disbelieve what the arithmetic of disaster is telling us, time is very short. Here I wish to be very plainspoken: It is up to us to show, specifically, the best way back to greatness, and to argue for it with all the passion of our patriotism. But, should the best way be blocked, while the enemy draws nearer, then someone will need to find the second best way. Or the third, because the nations survival requires it. Purity in martyrdom is for suicide bombers. King Pyrrhus is remembered, but his nation disappeared. Winston Churchill set aside his lifetime loathing of Communism in order to fight World War II. Challenged as a hypocrite, he said that when the safety of Britain was at stake, his conscience became a good girl. We are at such a moment. I for one have no interest in standing in the wreckage of our Republic saying I told you so or You shouldve done it my way. We must be the vanguard of recovery, but we cannot do it alone. We have learned in Indiana, big change requires big majorities. We will need people who never tune in to Rush or Glenn or Laura or Sean. Who surf past C-SPAN to get to SportsCenter. Who, if theyd ever heard of CPAC, would assume it was a cruise ship accessory. The second worst outcome I can imagine for next year would be to lose to the current president and subject the nation to what might be a fatal last dose of statism. The worst would be to win the election and then prove ourselves incapable of turning the ship of state before it went on the rocks, with us at the helm. So we must unify America, or enough of it, to demand and sustain the Big Change we propose. Here are a few suggestions: We must display a heart for every American, and a special passion for those still on the first rung of lifes ladder. Upward mobility from the bottom is the crux of the American promise, and the stagnation of the middle class is in fact becoming a problem, on any fair reading of the facts. Our main task is not to see that people of great wealth add to it, but that those without much money have a greater chance to earn some. We should address ourselves to young America at every opportunity. It is their futures that todays policies endanger, and in their direct interest that we propose a new direction. We should distinguish carefully skepticism about Big Government from contempt for all government. After all, it is a new government we hope to form, a government we will ask our fellow citizens to trust to make huge changes. I urge a similar thoughtfulness about the rhetoric we deploy in the great debate ahead. I suspect everyone here regrets and laments the sad, crude coarsening of our popular culture. It has a counterpart in the venomous, petty, often ad hominem political discourse of the day. When one of us  I confess sometimes it was yours truly  got a little hotheaded, President Reagan would admonish us, Remember, we have no enemies, only opponents. Good advice, then and now. And besides, our opponents are better at nastiness than we will ever be. It comes naturally. Power to them is everything, so theres nothing they wont say to get it. The public is increasingly disgusted with a steady diet of defamation, and prepared to reward those who refrain from it. Am I alone in observing that one of conservatisms best moments this past year was a massive rally that came and went from Washington without leaving any trash, physical or rhetorical, behind? A more affirmative, better angels approach to voters is really less an aesthetic than a practical one: with apologies for the banality, I submit that, as we ask Americans to join us on such a boldly different course, it would help if they liked us, just a bit. Lastly, critically, I urge great care not to drift into a loss of faith in the American people. In speech after speech, article upon article, we remind each other how many are dependent on government, or how few pay taxes, or how much essential virtues like family formation or civic education have withered. All true. All worrisome. But we must never yield to the self-fulfilling despair that these problems are immutable, or insurmountable. All great enterprises have a pearl of faith at their core, and this must be ours: that Americans are still a people born to liberty. That they retain the capacity for self-government. That, addressed as free-born, autonomous men and women of God-given dignity, they will rise yet again to drive back a mortal enemy. Historys assignment to this generation of freedom fighters is in one way even more profound than the tests of our proud past. We are tasked to rebuild not just a damaged economy, and a debt-ridden balance sheet, but to do so by drawing forth the best that is in our fellow citizens. If we would summon the best from Americans, we must assume the best about them. If we dont believe in Americans, who will? I do believe. Ive seen it in the people of our very typical corner of the nation. Ive seen it in the hundred Indiana homes in which I have stayed overnight. Ive seen it in Hoosiers resolute support of limited government, their willingness, even insistence, that government keep within the boundaries our constitutional surveyors mapped out for it. Ive always loved John Adams diary entry, written en route to Philadelphia, there to put his life, liberty, and sacred honor all at risk. He wrote that it was all well worth it because, he said, Great things are wanted to be done. When he and his colleagues arrived, and over the years ahead, they practiced the art of the possible. They made compacts and concessions and, yes, compromises. They made deep sectional and other differences secondary in pursuit of the grand prize of freedom. They each argued passionately for the best answers as they saw them, but they never permitted the perfect to be the enemy of the historic good they did for us, and all mankind. They gave us a Republic, citizen Franklin said, if we can keep it. Keeping the Republic is the great thing that is wanted to be done, now, in our time, by us. In this room are convened freedoms best friends but, to keep our Republic, freedom needs every friend it can get. Lets go find them, and befriend them, and welcome them to the great thing that is wanted to be done in our day. God bless this meeting and the liberty which makes it possible.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/17/mitch-daniels/mitch-daniels-says-interest-debt-will-soon-exceed-/,Economy,Polifact
22714,Romney CPAC Speech: It's All About the Jobs,"Fox News has obtained the prepared text of Mitt Romney's upcoming speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference. From what we see here, Romney's speech is all about the jobs, even referring to ""Obama's Misery Index."" Also of note is the ""Believe in America"" theme that Romney first sounded out in the introduction to the paperback version of his book ""No Apology: The Case For American Greatness."" In a bit of straw poll campaigning the ""Believe in America"" slogan is also on bumper stickers, lapel stickers and signs seen throughout the conference. Romney's wife Ann will introduce the former Massaschusetts governor. Here is the text of the speech: I've been in Ann's shadow ever since our first date in high school. Over our years together, she's waged some pretty impressive battles. Among her many accomplishments, none is more important or rewarding-to us and to our country-than her accomplishment as a successful mother of 5 and grandmother of 16. Thank you, Ann. The other night, from opposite coasts of the country, Ann and I watched President Obama's State of the Union address. Ann figured out pretty fast what was going on. She sent me an email saying that it sounded like he was reading my CPAC speech from last year. What we were hearing was not just a new and improved Barack Obama; it was an entirely different Barack Obama. Saul Alinsky was out; Jeffrey Immelt was in. The President went from ""Change you can believe in"" to ""Can you believe this change?"" He sounded like he was going to dig up the First Lady's organic garden to put in a Bob's Big Boy. But as the speech went on, it was clear that this was just the appearance of change: His answer for Americans out of work was more government spending and $50 billion for high speed rail. He replaced his Chicago politician chief of staff with a fresh face from Chicago, named Daley. Make no mistake: What we are watching is not Brave New World; what we're watching is Groundhog Day! Two years ago, this new President faced an economic crisis and an increasingly uncertain world. An uncertain world has been made more dangerous by the lack of clear direction from a weak President. The President who touted his personal experience as giving him special insight into foreign affairs was caught unprepared when Iranian citizens rose up against oppression. His proposed policy of engagement with Iran and North Korea won him the Nobel Peace Prize. How's that worked out? Iran armed Hezbollah and Hamas and is rushing toward nuclear weapons. North Korea fired missiles, tested nukes, sunk a South Korean ship and shelled a South Korean island. And his ""reset program"" with Russia? That consisted of our President abandoning our missile defense in Poland and signing a one-sided nuclear treaty. The cause of liberty cannot endure much more of his ""they get, we give"" diplomacy! The world - and our valiant troops - watched in confusion as the President announced that he intended to win the war in Afghanistan....as long as it didn't go much beyond August of 2011. And while the Taliban may not have an air force or sophisticated drones, it's safe to say... they do have calendars. I surely hope that at some point in the near future, the President will finally be able to construct a foreign policy, any foreign policy. Here at home, the President's response to the economic crisis was the most expensive failed social experiment in modern history. He guaranteed that unemployment wouldn't go beyond 8%. As he watched millions and millions of Americans lose their jobs, lose their homes and lose their hope, his response was this: It could be worse. It could be worse? This is the leader of the Free World's answer to the greatest job loss since the Great Depression? What's next? Let them eat cake? Oh, excuse me. Organic cake. It's often said that the Presidency of the United States is the toughest job in the world. Fair enough. Undoubtedly true. But how difficult is it to take office in the middle of a raging economic crisis and understand that the economy should be your number one priority? The President who took office on January 20th, 2009 should have had one central mission - put Americans back to work! Fight for every job! Because every job is a paycheck and paychecks fuel Americans dreams. Without a paycheck, you can't take care of your family. Without a paycheck you can't buy school books for your kids, keep a car on the road or help an aging parent make ends meet. President Barack Obama has stood watch over the greatest job loss in modern American history. And that, my friends, is one inconvenient truth that will haunt this President throughout history. Today there are more men and women out of work in America than there are people working in Canada. And in the month of January, Canada created more new jobs than we did. When Ronald Reagan ran for President, he hung the Misery Index around Jimmy Carter's neck. Today's misery is real unemployment, home foreclosures and bankruptcies. This is the Obama Misery Index-and it's at a record high. It's going to take more than new rhetoric to put Americans back to work-it's going to take a new president. Let me make this very clear. If I decide to run for President, it won't take me two years to wake up to the job crisis threatening America. And I won't be asking Tim Geithner how the economy works-or Larry Summers how to start a business. Fifteen million Americans are out of work. And millions and millions more can't find the good paying jobs they long for and deserve. You've seen the heartbreaking photos and videos of the jobs fairs around the country, where thousands show up to stand in line all day just to have a chance to compete for a few job openings that probably aren't as good as the job they held two years ago. These job fairs and unemployment lines are President Obama's Hoovervilles. Make no mistake. This is a moral tragedy-a moral tragedy of epic proportion. Unemployment is not just a statistic. Fifteen million unemployed is not just a number. Unemployment means kids can't go to college; that marriages break up under the financial strain; that young people can't find work and start their lives; and men and women in their 50s, in the prime of their lives, fear they will never find a job again. Liberals should be ashamed that they and their policies have failed these good and decent Americans! The President is trying to show that he finally gets it-that he really isn't a liberal after all. But his idea of conservative economic policy is to invite some corporate CEO's to the White House for an evening of table-talk. I'm sorry Mr. President, but that's not a policy, it's a dinner party. We've seen the failure of liberal answers before. Liberal welfare policies condemned generations to dependency and poverty. Liberal education policies fail our children today, because they put pensions and privilege for union bosses above the reading scores of our kids. Liberal social policies have failed to protect the unborn. And now, the hollow promises of liberal economic policies have failed to provide millions of Americans with the dignity of work. Under the pressure of a crisis, people turn to what they really believe. With our economy in crisis, the President and his fellow liberals turned to Europe for their answers. Like the Europeans, they grew the government, they racked up bigger deficits, they took over healthcare, they pushed cap and trade, they stalled production of our oil and gas and coal, they fought to impose unions on America's workers, and they created over a hundred new agencies and commissions and hundreds of thousands of pages of new regulations. Theirs is a European-style solution to an American problem. It does not work there and it will never work here! The right answer is not to believe in European solutions. The right answer is to believe in America-to believe in free enterprise, capitalism, limited government, federalism-and to believe in the constitution, as it was written and intended by the founders. My father never graduated from college. He apprenticed as a lath and plaster carpenter, and he was darn good at it. He learned how to put a handful of nails in his mouth and spit them out, point forward. On his honeymoon, he and Mom drove across the country. Dad sold aluminum paint along the way, to pay for gas and hotels. Dad always believed in America; and in that America, a lath and plaster man could work his way up to running a little car company called American Motors and end up Governor of a state where he had once sold aluminum paint. For my Dad, America was the land of opportunity, where free enterprise, small business and entrepreneurs were encouraged and respected. The spirit of enterprise propelled America's economy and our standard of living past every other nation on earth. I refuse to believe that America is just another place on the map with a flag. I believe that America is an exceptional nation, of freedom and opportunity and hope. The America I believe in has goodness and a greatness that creates a unique American genius. That genius has blessed the world, led the world and yes, even saved the world from unimaginable darkness. We didn't originate the concept of liberty but our Founding Fathers redefined it and shared it with the world. From the brilliant sands of Omaha beach to the dark valleys of the Hindu Kush, we have fought with an unmatched courage and determination, not to conquer territory, but to give others the chance to experience the liberty that is humanity's destiny. Given all that America has done to lift others from poverty, given the millions of afflicted we have helped to heal and comfort, and given the hundreds of thousands of lives of America's sons and daughters that have been, and are today, sacrificed to defend freedom, I will not apologize for America! I don't apologize for America because I believe in America! We believe in freedom, in opportunity. We believe in free enterprise and capitalism. We believe in the American dream. And we believe that the principles that made America the leader of the world today are the very principles that will keep America the leader of the world tomorrow. These last two years have not been the best of times. But while we've lost a couple of years, we have not lost our way. This is fundamentally what conservatism is all about. We sing for God to bless America. He already has, he does now and thanks to the greatness of the American people and the principles that guide us, he will do so for generations to come. Believe in America. Freedom depends on it. Thank you.

22721,General Motors Debt,"Q: Did General Motors repay its TARP loan from the Treasury with other TARP money? A: Yes. GM repaid the loan portion of the automaker bailout ahead of schedule, with interest. It used TARP money it had already received but hadnt spent. And taxpayers are still stuck with GM stock that isnt worth what was paid for it. FULL QUESTION There are GM commercials and mass mailings that say theyve paid back their ""government loans"" ahead of schedule with interest. Didnt the government take a 71% ownership in the company? Was that a loan or is the loan a smoke screen for the actual government ownership? Has GM repaid its bailout loan in full with interest, 5 years ahead of schedule? GM is running advertisements claiming the above statement is true, and the President seemed to reaffirm that claim in his most recent radio address. However, Sen. Grassely (R) claims that GM is using other bailout funds in order to pay off the aforementioned bailout funds and their claim is simply an accounting trick. FULL ANSWER Many readers have asked us about the White House-touted news that General Motors, and Chrysler, repaid loan money from the Treasury Department, with interest, ahead of schedule. GM launched an ad boasting of the news, and President Obama talked about it in his weekly address on April 24. We wrote about this, too, on April 26 in a review of the Sunday political talk shows. Heres the deal for those who missed that post: Yes, its true that GM paid back its loan from the Treasury Department, in full, ahead of schedule. But the debt was only part of the automaker bailout package. Through the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the Treasury gave GM $49.5 billion, most of which was converted into an ownership stake in the form of stock. Through this equity stake, the government still owns 61 percent of GM. Some Republicans, including Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa have pointed out that GM used TARP money to pay back its TARP debt. Thats true, but GM simply handed back TARP money it had been lent and hadnt used. Those funds had been sitting in an escrow account, should the automaker need them. (The company didnt borrow new money to pay back an older loan.) Grassley has argued that this wasnt a ""meaningful"" repayment of a loan, since it didnt come from earnings. Thats an opinion, and well leave it to readers to agree or disagree with the senator. The TARP special inspector general, Neil Barofsky, has said the repayment was ""good news,"" since it meant the automaker didnt need to use those funds held in escrow. In testimony before the Senate Finance Committee on April 20, Barofksy made it clear GM still was operating with government help: Barofsky, April 20: G.M. has paid $1 billion, and I think theyve announced that theyre going to be paying back the debt portion, which is about  I think theres about $6 billion left in its entirety very shortly. But we should be a little  we need to be a little bit cautious about that because the way that that payments going to be made is drawing down an equity facility of other TARP money. So its good news in that theyre reducing their debt, but theyre using it by taking other available TARP money to repay the TARP. Its good news because it means that money, which was going to be available for future problems with G.M., that theres a determination that they dont need it, but we should caution that its not necessarily being generated out of earnings, but out of other TARP funds. In an April 21 interview with Fox News Neil Cavuto, Barofsky repeated his assessment that the repayment was ""good news"" but should be taken with a grain of salt. ""I mean, the good news is, that money  they already have that money thats in that escrow account, so it does lower the total amount of money that they owe to the government, so thats somewhat good news,"" Barofsky said. ""But I dont think we should exaggerate it too much, when we remember where  the source of this money is just other TARP money."" The presidents and GMs statements may have given some the false impression that taxpayers have gotten back all the bailout money loaned to or invested in GM. Strictly speaking, Obama was accurate when he said: ""GM announced that it paid back its loans to taxpayers with interest, fully five years ahead of schedule."" But he alluded only vaguely to other bailout money, which taxpayers may never get back, adding: ""It wont be too long before the stock the Treasury is holding in GM can be sold, helping to reimburse the American people for their investment."" Those statements might have confused anyone who wasnt familiar with the details of GMs stock-and-loan debt to the Treasury. As for Treasurys equity stake, worth $40 billion-plus, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the Treasury wont fully recoup that money. The total automaker bailout, including TARP money given to Chrysler, CBO estimates, will cost taxpayers about $34 billion.  Lori Robertson Update, May 3: The CBO doesnt give a breakdown of how much of its $34 billion cost estimate for the bailout would have gone to General Motors. But most of the automaker bailout funds went to GM. While the Treasury has a 61 percent equity stake in GM, its stake in Chrysler is 9.9 percent. Sources Obama, Barack. Weekly address, transcript.

22739,Rand Paul: Republicans 'Aren't Maybe Brave Enough' to Tackle Deficit,"In an exclusive interview with ABC News, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., took aim at the newly released House GOP budget, saying it falls far short of what needs to be done to deal with the federal deficit. ""It's really not going to touch the problem,"" Paul said. ""There's a disconnect between Republicans who want a balanced budget but aren't maybe yet brave enough to talk about the cuts to come."" The plan by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., released on Thursday, would cut non-security discretionary spending by $58 billion by the end of fiscal year 2011, which ends on Sept. 30. In an far-ranging interview aboard the Capitol Subway, Paul embraced the label ""true believer"" and said staying true to the principles of the Tea Party movement is more important to him than being a Republican. He also refused to rule out a future run for president and suggested it may be time to reduce U.S. force levels in Afghanistan. Paul has proposed his own plan to cut spending by $500 billion this year. Paul's plan would impose deep across-the-board spending cuts -- including a reduction of 83 percent from the Department of Education, 6 percent from the Department of Defense and the elimination all foreign aid. He considers it just a start. ""I go to a tea party and you know what they say to me? It's not enough. It's not enough. Where's the other trillion you need?"" Paul said. Paul defended his call to end to all foreign aid -- including the $3 billion the U.S. gives to Israel every year. ""I'm not singling out Israel. I support Israel. I want to be known as a friend of Israel,"" Paul said, ""but not with money you don't have. We can't just borrow from our kids' future and give it to countries even if they are our friends."" Paul has come under fire from supporters of Israel, but said Israel has enough financial resources to fend for itself. ""I think they're an important ally, but I also think that their per capita income is greater than probably three-fourths of the rest of the world,"" Paul said. ""Should we be giving free money or welfare to a wealthy nation? I don't think so."" And military resources, as well. ""I think they're probably 10 years ahead of any neighboring country,"" he said. ""I think that their defense is very significant and probably well in advance of any of their particular enemies."" Regarding Afghanistan, Paul said it is up to the president to determine troop levels, but, ""I personally think you can have a much smaller presence."" As for his own political allegiances, Paul made it clear he is a Tea Party activist first and a Republican second. ""There are always problems in our nation's capitol that are more important than party affiliation and I will always believe that,"" Paul said. ""It's not necessarily Tea Party versus Republican Party, but I would say that if you ask me what's more important, tackling our nation's deficit, our nation's debt problems or being a Republican, I would say tackling the debt.""",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/04/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-israels-capita-income-greater-proba/,Economy,Polifact
22805,A train that Ohioans were lucky to miss: Brent Larkin,"During his classless exit from office, Gov. Ted Strickland has constantly whined of the ""tragic"" decision by Gov.-elect John Kasich to kill a passenger rail plan for Ohio, labeling it perhaps the saddest event of Strickland's one term as governor. Strickland's decency has long been considered his strongest attribute. But by spending the last two months desperately rewriting history, he stands in real danger of being remembered more for anger and bitterness. In any case, his stubborn support for the train proves that being a good man doesn't guarantee good decisions. While the outgoing governor may have been saddened by Kasich's decision to return a $400 million federal grant to build a train system linking Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati, the decision should have cheered Ohioans. By telling the federal government to keep its $400 million, Kasich probably saved the state's taxpayers at least that much. Critics, including Strickland, have depicted Kasich's decision as a jobs-killer. Actually, proceeding with this boondoggle would have caused far more economic pain. Over time, the train project would have blown such a gigantic hole in the state budget it would have adversely impacted state spending for schools, children, the poor, the aged and the ill. Voters never warmed to the idea of spending hundreds of millions on a passenger rail project that would have taken riders from Cleveland to Cincinnati over a period an hour and 15 minutes longer than it would have taken on a New York Central train in 1935. A Columbus Dispatch poll in September showed that far more Ohioans opposed the train plan than supported it. Nevertheless, in a vain attempt to sell this project to the public, state officials changed their story so often it made the head swim. Truth is, one needn't be Nostradamus to project cost overruns totaling hundreds of millions of dollars -- with the money to cover those overruns coming directly from the pockets of Ohio taxpayers. When the Obama administration offered Ohio $400 million for the rail project, Strickland administration officials essentially said, ""Sure, that should cover it."" But just months earlier, as part of the state's application to the feds, the administration placed the startup cost at $563.7 million. It gets worse. A Government Accounting Office study of transportation projects, requested by Congress, concluded in March 2009 that passenger rail projects ""had the highest cost escalation out of all the transportation modes studied -- averaging 45 percent higher than estimated."" ODOT's ridership predictions called for an annual taxpayer subsidy of $17 million over 20 years. But that same GAO report cited a study of 27 rail projects that found ridership forecasts for 90 percent of the projects were overestimated, with 67 percent overestimated by more than two-thirds. Last month, Strickland said the train plan would have created 16,000 jobs, a figure that doubled the state's earlier estimates of 8,000 jobs. ODOT's own website claims 8,000 jobs -- and even that figure is wildly inflated. Think about it: Aside from the temporary work to upgrade existing railroad track, how many people does it take to run three or four trains a day up and down the state? A few hundred sounds about right. A Time magazine story published just last week concluded that Ohio's ""pitiful"" rail plan""did not make sense"" and actually had the potential to ""destroy momentum for investments"" in legitimate high-speed rail. A far better use of the rail money would have been to build a new system with 120-mph train service linking the Cleveland and Akron airports. Or to begin a real high-speed system in growth areas of southwest Ohio. Those types of wise and creative investments in rail -- in trains that travel faster than the ones in the 1800s did -- actually might have created meaningful jobs and grown Ohio's economy. The project Kasich killed was neither wise nor creative. And sending $400 million back to the federal government wasn't the least bit sad. Goodbye, and thank you Cuyahoga County Commissioner Tim Hagan left office last week; county Treasurer Jim Rokakis will leave in a week or two -- departures mandated by the county government reform approved by voters in 2009. Together, the two served more than six decades in elected life. Rokakis was treasurer for nearly 14 years after earlier spending nearly two decades on Cleveland City Council. Hagan served two stints as commissioner totaling 24 years. Rokakis was perhaps the most gifted and creative county official of the past quarter-century. Hagan's initial, 16-year run as commissioner, from 1982 to 1998, was clearly his best work. But throughout his long career in elected life, Hagan's reputation for integrity remained intact and he never wavered from a genuine commitment to the county's less fortunate citizens. In recent years, Rokakis and Hagan weren't always treated fairly in news coverage. Like all of us, both have flaws. Rokakis can be notoriously thin-skinned and Hagan's demeanor can at times be mistaken for arrogance. But over the long haul, both made significant contributions and served this community well.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2011/jan/07/brent-larkin/columnist-brent-larkins-claim-about-1935-steam-tra/,Economy,Polifact

23277,Bob Gibbs,"Issues JOBS AND THE ECONOMY Ohioans want to know that Washington is working for us, not the other way around. I understand that government does not create jobs, people do. We need an economic policy that gets DC bureaucrats out of the way of the men and women who start and expand their businesses. We cannot afford to have bureaucratic red tape and senseless regulations prevent our parents, siblings, or friends and neighbors from achieving the American Dream. If we want to give every person his or her chance at the American Dream, we have to: 1. Get federal spending under control 2. Enact commonsense regulatory reform that does not punish those just starting a business 3. Tackle and reform our tax code to help families and incentivize work for all Americans 4. Promote an energy policy that encourages the responsible development of our natural resources, creating a safe, reliable and affordable energy supply for all Americans GOVERNMENT SPENDING Its no secret that Washingtons spending is out of control. We cannot continue down the path we are on and DCs reckless spending must be reined in. I have consistently voted against legislation that increases spending. It is time government learns to live within their means, which is why I support a constitutional amendment requiring Congress to balance the budget every year. REGULATORY REFORM One thing I hear all the time from Ohioans is that government rules and regulations can make life a nightmare for farmers, business owners or entrepreneurs. Burdensome and unnecessary regulations are hidden taxes that make it harder for Americans to realize their full potential. Worse yet, it drives up prices for those struggling to get by. I am on record supporting legislation that requires Congress give an up or down vote on costly new regulations that will negatively impact Americans. If we want to reform Washington, we have to reform the way they regulate. TAX REFORM Washingtons overspending wont be solved with higher taxes. We cannot tax our way out of deficit spending and should not do it on the backs of Ohios families. We need a tax code that gives Americans the opportunity to rise and that encourages economic growth. Our tax system should encourage American companies to stay in the United States and to hire American workers. Having the highest corporate tax rate in the world only incentivizes companies to move their operations and workforce overseas. We need a tax policy that encourages and rewards work, a system that helps people be lifted up out of poverty. THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS The Second Amendment is not a suggestion; it is a God-given right of the people to self-defense. I have consistently supported legislation that protects and expands an Americans right to keep and bear arms. Gun control regulations will only hurt law-abiding citizens while doing nothing to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. I am proud of my record of supporting the right of sportsmen to carry concealed firearms on government lands and expanding the ability of Americans who follow the law to carry concealed firearms. PROTECTING THE RIGHT TO LIFE Every life is precious, a gift from God. We should do everything we can to protect the lives of the unborn, those who are the most vulnerable and voiceless. I have always supported pro-life efforts and believe groups that perform abortions, like Planned Parenthood, should not get one dime of taxpayer dollars. I have also supported legislation that stops abortions later than 20 weeks, which is when babies are able to begin feeling pain. We must do more to protect those who cannot speak for themselves. ENERGY We have been blessed with an abundance of natural resources. The energy renaissance occurring in Ohio and other states has shown that new technologies and private sector innovation is the key to a thriving economy powered by safe, reliable and affordable energy. Obamas war on coal is having devastating effects on the communities that rely on coal for jobs and for affordable energy. The take-home pay for everyday Americans is stagnant, so why would anyone want to squeeze their budgets even further? Making it harder and more expensive to mine and utilize coal will hurt Americans that are already hurting the most. I believe in an energy policy that encourages the responsible development of our naturals resources, creates jobs and powers our economy with safe and affordable energy. HEALTH CARE Its simple: Obamacare must be repealed. Premiums are skyrocketing, deductibles are increasing and coverage networks are shrinking. Government-run healthcare is not the answer. We need health care reform that empowers Americans to take control of their care, to make sure decisions are made between a doctor and a patient. Bureaucrats in Washington should not be deciding what treatments a patient should be getting. Health care reform must focus on these principles: 1. Strenghten the doctor-patient relationship 2. Encourage the use of health savings accounts for routine visits and preventive care 3. Implement market-based reforms that encourage private sector competition Theres no doubt that our health care industry needs reforms, but bigger government will make the problems worse. NATIONAL SECURITY Our top priority needs to be the protection and safety of our nation. We are facing threats at home and abroad. ISIS is a real threat to the United States; it is not the JV team Obama says it is. We must do everything we can to protect our nation and prevent a major attack on U.S. soil. Recent attacks in Europe highlight how important it is to thoroughly vet refugees attempting to enter the United States. We should pause our acceptance of Syrian and Iraqi refugees until a system is put in place to make absolutely certain there are no terrorists slipping through the cracks and entering our nation. Our enemies abroad have taken advantage of Obamas weaknesses. I opposed the nuclear deal with Iran from day one. It is irresponsible to allow a nation that chants Death to America and calls for the destruction of our ally Israel to conduct nuclear research. That is why I have voted against this deal. We need to reverse the Iran nuclear deal before they get their hands on a nuclear weapon.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2010/jul/24/bob-gibbs/house-candidate-bob-gibbs-touts-coal-power-generat/,Economy,Polifact

23440,"Penniless California issues IOUs to firms, clinics, taxpayers and students","Money woes in the most populous US state have given birth to an impromptu trading market for the newest of American financial instruments  the California IOU. Encumbered by a $26bn (16bn) budget shortfall and a seemingly intractable political stalemate, California's state government is issuing IOUs to businesses, health clinics, college students and taxpayers who are owed money by the state. The green documents look like any ordinary cheque except for the words ""registered warrant"" stamped in the corner. They carry a 3.75% interest rate and can be cashed in October, by which time California's governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, is hoping that he will have some money. Entrepreneurs have been quick to leap on the phenomenon, with Craigslist and eBay cluttered with offers. A website, BuyMyIOU.com, aims to match sellers of the warrants with buyers eager to snap up the above-market interest rate. ""The market's at an early stage  we're really in the infancy of it right now,"" said Mark Granger, president of Pacific West Managers, a finance company offering to buy IOUs. ""It's a little unusual to see the state of California resorting to paying its bills like this."" California is the world's eighth largest economy but its financial situation is grave. The once booming property market has been hit catastrophically by foreclosures and its wealthy elite have seen their income wiped out by stockmarket woes. Usually 1% of the population contribute 50% of income tax revenue, but the capital gains of these rich individuals have evaporated. Dismal relations between Democrats and Republicans have all but frozen business in the state capital, Sacramento. A two-thirds majority is required to pass any budget, but Republicans, with just over a third of the legislature, are refusing to countenance tax rises while the Democrats are balking at spending cuts. Schwarzenegger has proposed deep cuts to social programmes, including aid for the elderly, disabled and impoverished, plus cuts to schools, healthcare and universities. Larry Gerston, a professor of political science at San Jos State University, says this will accentuate an already yawning gap between the rich and poor: ""The state is quickly becoming an hourglass economy. The middle class is all but evaporating  people are either moving further to the top or sinking to the bottom."" The initial victims of the standoff are California's creditors, who had received 91,000 IOUs worth $354m as of the end of Thursday. High-street banks, including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase, agreed to cash them for a few days but announced that they would not accept them beyond the end of the week. ""There's a sentiment inside the banks that the longer they accept the warrants, the longer the budget impasse will go on,"" said Beth Mills, a spokeswoman for the Californian Bankers Association. That leaves IOU holders with limited options. Certain local credit unions are still taking the notes at face value. Beyond that, holders face a choice of either waiting until October to receive their money or selling them at a discount on a rapidly developing informal market. Many online offers for the IOUs propose dubious rates. On eBay, one buyer was willing to pay $140 in return for $170 worth of IOUs. Granger, whose firm sees the debt crisis as a potentially lucrative opportunity, said a market rate was emerging of between 80 and 95 cents on the dollar. ""Because they're cumbersome and troublesome to deal with, a lot of the big investment houses are not going to deal with them,"" he said. ""And some people will just put them in their piggy banks."" Last week, the credit agency Fitch cut its rating on California's debt by two notches from ""A minus"" to BBB - just two levels above ""junk"" status. Analysts fear that there could be weeks of IOUs to come. Gerston says a confrontational culture of extreme left-wing and right-wing politics has contributed to the morass, as has a reluctance to wake up to problems: ""Californians are known as laidback for a reason they've earned that reputation. Most people just don't believe what's in front of them. They just don't buy it.""",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/11/jerry-brown/jerry-brown-says-californias-not-golden-state-when/,Economy,Polifact
23781,America's Most Toxic Cities,"In Atlanta, Ga., you'll find southern gentility, a world-class music scene--and 21,000 tons of environmental waste. In spite of its charms, the city's combination of air pollution and atmospheric chemicals makes it the most toxic city in the country. An urban skyline dotted with puffing smokestacks isn't the only measure of a city's cleanliness (or lack thereof). Most major cities suffer from a range of unseen hazards. Contaminants can seep into the ground from bygone chemical spills or shuttered steel mills. Invisible leaks at industrial complexes discharge harmful substances into the air, or the normal course of business requires factories to expel toxins that eventually find their way to the water supply. While it may be the U.S. metro in the worst environmental shape, Atlanta isn't the only place whose residents contend with contamination. Top spots for toxicity are distributed throughout the country, with Detroit, Houston, Chicago, Philadelphia, Cleveland and Los Angeles right behind it. Cleaning up these cities is neither easy nor cheap. The Environmental Protection Agency expects that it will cost $10.5 billion in federal money in 2010 to improve the U.S. environment's health in general and to craft clean energy solutions. Behind the Numbers To determine which cities are most toxic, Forbes looked at the country's 40 largest metropolitan statistical areas--geographic entities that the U.S. Office of Management and Budget defines and uses in collecting statistics--based on data provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. We counted the number of facilities that reported releasing toxins into the environment, the total pounds of certain toxic chemicals released into the air, water and earth, the days per year that air pollution was above healthy levels, and the number of times the EPA has responded to reports of a potentially hazardous environmental incident or site in each metro area's principal city. The reports vary in seriousness, and not all require clean-up action from the EPA. Click here to for an interactive chart to see how your city ranks. Click here for complete methodology and a glossary of environmental terms. Crowded urban areas are often thought of as the most polluted, but the latter isn't always caused by the former. While the Atlanta metro area takes top honors for toxicity, don't blame the city alone. The Atlanta metro includes the city of Marietta, the site of chemical plants and metal coaters. The city has toxic release levels higher than those of the principal city of Atlanta, in spite of a population 13% the size of Atlanta's. Environmental advocates say weak regulations are to blame. ""We struggle to have strong environmental leadership,"" says Jenette Gayer, policy advocate for Environment Georgia, an environmental advocacy organization. ""For a lot of the chemicals people reported dumping, there are alternatives we should be helping them switch to."" Similarly, while the Philadelphia metro area is our fourth most toxic area, the City of Brotherly Love doesn't hold the bulk of the blame for the pollution. Factories in smaller Wilmington, Del., in the same metro area, reported releasing 57% more pounds of toxins than Philadelphia in 2007. Wilmington houses a Pepsi bottler and General Motors assembly plant, as well as the headquarters of chemical company Dupont . Some cities, like Houston--our third most toxic city--contend with air that is far filthier than it should be. Facilities in Houston released 88.7 million pounds of toxic chemicals in the environment in 2007, and the former site of a methanol fire and chemical explosion number among the city's 50 sites necessitating an EPA response. Factories that serve the local petrochemical industry emit benzene and 1-3 butabeine, toxins proven to be particularly harmful, that the area's intense sunlight and lack of wind keep trapped in the local area's atmosphere. ""Houston has an air problem,"" says Jim Lester, vice president of the Houston Advanced Research Center, a Woodlands, Texas-based nonprofit that studies and promotes sustainable development. ""It has had one for a number of years, and we've been working on it extensively since about 2000."" Los Angeles, a city whose traffic-clogged freeways contribute to its famously poor air quality, experiences similar weather patterns that add to its existing air-quality problems. It ties for fourth most toxic city. ""Los Angeles is in a geographic basin surrounded by mountains,"" says Brian Turnbaugh, policy analyst for the Environmental Right to Know project at OMB Watch, a government watchdog organization. ""The pollution doesn't go away; it kind of just sits there, creating these horrible smog days."" Big Lights, Clean City High population density--the contrast to Atlanta's sprawl--can be a good thing in terms of toxicity. Limiting traffic has helped urban centers like New York City, which are often associated with grit and grime. A highly efficient subway system keeps New York outside the worst 20 cities in terms of toxicity. ""New York City has extremely high density, but excellent public transportation,"" says Turnbaugh. Still, the area is more toxic than 18 of the large cities we looked at, proving that cracking down on waste and emissions is a complex, long-term problem. ""The public transportation system can only accomplish so much, given that you've got people coming and going from outlying areas."" Some cities, like Portland, Ore., have avoided becoming highly toxic by devoting city resources to environmentally friendly planning. ""Portland is known for its innovative land-use policies,"" says Turnbaugh. The city has been working to curb urban sprawl and encourage density since the 1970s. But Portland has underlying problems that make it more toxic than half the cities we surveyed. ""It was suffering, for years, from out-of-control growth. Those policies were a reaction to that."" Portland and New York demonstrate the myriad and wide-ranging causes of toxicity. No one measure is enough to completely address the problem, nor can one solution apply to all toxic cities. These two cities themselves couldn't be more different in terms of size or lifestyle, yet they're next to each other on our list. ""I don't know of any metro area that has really nipped it in the bud,"" says Turnbaugh of the effort to assess and clean urban toxicity. But some of the most affected cities are attempting to address the problem with ambitious programs. ""Texas has invested $800 million in trying to replace old dirty diesel engines with cleaner diesel,"" says David Hitchcock, director of sustainable transportation programs at HARC. But a silver lining has emerged from the negative focus that one of the country's most toxic city has attracted: Houston, of all places, is now a vanguard for advancing sustainability. ""We're now one of the favorite places in the world for doing air-quality science,"" says Lester. ""The more people understand about it, the more changes are likely that will take us in a positive direction.""

GREGG: It's a piggy bank which adds to our deficit, adds to our debt and gets put (INAUDIBLE) tax. ORSZAG: The degree to which shifting funds would add to our debt or deficits depends on what the net subsidy rate would be on that new activity. And remember, the purpose of TARP was to address problems in our financial markets. One of the -- and it has been remarkably successful in bringing credit spreads back down to normal levels. One of the lingering problems in our financial markets, however, is access to credit for small businesses. It's why in this budget, we're... GREGG: No, no, no! You can't make that type of statement with any legitimacy! ORSZAG: OK. GREGG: You cannot make that statement! This is the law! ORSZAG: (INAUDIBLE) they're not suffering from (INAUDIBLE) GREGG: Let me tell you what the law says! ORSZAG: ... lack of access... GREGG: Let me read it to you again because you don't appear to understand the law! The law is very clear!

This money is to reduce the debt of our children! (END VIDEO CLIP) VAN SUSTEREN: Ouch! Well, for the inside story on that showdown, we went to Capitol Hill and Senator Gregg went ""On the Record."" (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VAN SUSTEREN: Senator, nice to see you, sir. GREGG: Greta, thank you for having me. Thank you very much. VAN SUSTEREN: Well, thank you for letting us come to your office. GREGG: Appreciate you coming in. VAN SUSTEREN: All right, today you had quite a showdown with the -- with Peter Orszag. GREGG: Well, you know, they've sent up a budget which by their own terms is unsustainable. It puts us on a path which is basically going to lead us to fiscal insolvency as a nation, in my opinion, and I think in a lot of other people's opinion. It's a huge deficit machine, is what they've proposed, and that leads to debt. And the debt is not sustainable. It gets passed on to our kids, and basically, will lower the quality of life of our children, and that's not fair. I feel very strongly that when you send a budget like that up, you should also send up some fairly big ideas for how you're going to address it in the out years, how you're going to keep us from going off the road, how you're going to keep us from passing on to our kids a nation that can be afforded. And there are no big ideas in this budget on the issue of fiscal discipline. None. There are some -- there are some ideas, and I support their freeze concept. But the freeze is $10 billion. Compared to a $1.6 trillion deficit, it's really not going to get us there. VAN SUSTEREN: Well, one of the things that he brought up that, obviously, you were quite heated about, was the whole idea of taking some of the returned TARP money and giving it to community banks to the tune of $30 billion for lending. You say that that's not legal or not authorized by the statute. GREGG: No. The way TARP was set up, you know, we borrowed this money -- we borrowed it from Americans and we borrowed it from the Chinese, and we took it and we used it to stabilize the financial industry during a severe crisis which would have basically bankrupted Main Street, had all these banks failed. VAN SUSTEREN: So (INAUDIBLE) just set aside some cash... GRAHAM: No, this is not in a drawer somewhere. We had to go out and borrow it. And as part of that decision, there is very clear language put in the bill -- I wrote it, that's why I know it was clear -- that said when the money comes back -- and we expected it to come back, and in many cases, coming back with interest, so we're actually making money on it -- the money has to be used, shall be used to reduce the debt. That's what the law says. That's what TARP says. That was intentionally put in there so that the money could not be used as a piggy bank for whatever the initiative is, no matter how good an idea it is. Now the president is suggesting that he wants to take $30 billion of the paid back funds and use it for some other initiative. Well, that's not consistent with the law and it's not consistent with what we should do, basically. We should reduce the debt with this money. If we -- if we terminated TARP today, which we should, we would reduce the debt over the next couple of years by $200 billion $300 billion. That's a big chunk of debt reduction. And it -- and that's exactly what we should be doing with this TARP money. We shouldn't be using it to create a new program here, a new program there, depending on which way the wind is blowing on some given day. VAN SUSTEREN: Well, the word that I seized upon in listening to the exchange today is ""shall."" And when I was in law school, that wasn't a word that gave you any sort of wiggle room. It just must be. How does the -- how does the White House, the administration, justify saying that they can take the returned TARP money and send it out to these community banks, this $30 billion for loans? How do they justify it? GREGG: Well, the word is ""shall,"" and they can't do it legally. VAN SUSTEREN: So what happens? GREGG: So Mr. Orszag, to his credit, said they're going to change the law. You know, I mean, well, that makes no sense at all! I mean, the whole purpose here was to borrow money, put it out, stabilize the financial markets. When it gets paid back, pay down the borrowing so our kids didn't get stuck with the debt. What they're going to do is change the law so that they borrow the money, send it out to the stabilized financial institutions. When it gets paid back, they're going to spend it on something else so the debt is still out there and our kids still have to pay for it. VAN SUSTEREN: Do you think he knew the word ""shall"" was there before he showed up today? GREGG: No. VAN SUSTEREN: Or did you surprise him with ""shall""? GREGG: I'm not sure whether he knew it or not, but he pretty quickly confirmed that they were going to change the law. So he probably did know, yes. I guess I probably would have to give him credit for knowing it, yes. VAN SUSTEREN: So I take it you're not a big fan of the president's proposed budget. GREGG: No, the budget is a disaster. It really is. It's more government, more spending and more debt. But the real problem isn't the short run. The short run's a problem. But the real problem is in the out years, there's no compression of the delta. Spending continues to go up, and taxes can never catch it because the spending is going up so fast. They're taking the size of the government from 20 percent of the Gross National Product up to 25, 26 percent of the Gross National Product. That's simply not affordable. That means you're adding a trillion dollars of debt to our kids' backs every year for the foreseeable future. And at the end of 10 years, not only is it not coming down, it's still going up! VAN SUSTEREN: So what -- so if we were having this conversation 10 years from now, what would the economy look like, according to your prediction, assuming the president's proposed budget got passed? GREGG: I personally think we'll hit the wall long before 10 years. I think within 5 to 7 years... VAN SUSTEREN: What does that mean, ""hit the wall""? GREGG: It means that people have -- the people stop buying our debt or making it very difficult for us to sell debt, that the value of the currency is affected and that you either end up with a significant inflationary event or an event where you have to so significantly raise taxes that you reduce the productivity of the entire economy and you're no longer creating jobs. The simple situation -- the simple comparison is this. It's like a family that's been living beyond its means for many, many years and its income can never catch up with its debts. And at some point, the world community says to us, I'm sorry, we're not going to fund your debts any longer. We're simply not going to lend you the money you need. I mean, we're not operating off our own economy's ability to support us, we're operating because China is willing to lend us money and other nations are willing to lend us money. Well, they're putting up some fairly significant red flags right now that says, We're a little concerned about all your borrowing. And if we continue this borrowing, they're going to put up very severe red flags and say, Hey, maybe we're just not going to lend you anymore, or if we do lend to you, we're going to put a price on the lending which is so expensive that it makes it very hard for you to do much else with your government besides pay down your interest. VAN SUSTEREN: Senator, thank you, sir. GREGG: Thank you, Greta. (END VIDEOTAPE) Content and Programming Copyright 2010 Fox News Network, Inc. Copyright 2010 Roll Call, Inc.

24308,Administration Is Seeking $700 Billion for Wall Street,"With Congressional Republicans warning that the bailout could be slowed by efforts to tack on additional provisions, Democratic leaders said they would insist on a requirement that the administration use its new role, as the owner of large amounts of mortgage debt, to help hundreds of thousands of troubled borrowers at risk of losing their homes to foreclosure. Its clear that the administration has requested that Congress authorize, in very short order, sweeping and unprecedented powers for the Treasury secretary, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, said in a statement. Democrats will work with the administration to ensure that our response to events in the financial markets is swift, but we must insulate Main Street from Wall Street and keep people in their homes. Ms. Pelosi said Democrats would also insist on enacting an economic recovery package that creates jobs and returns growth to our economy. Even as talks got under way, there were signs of how very much in flux the plan remained. The administration suggested that it might adjust its proposal, initially restricted to purchasing assets from financial institutions based in the United States, to enable foreign firms with United States affiliates to make use of it as well. The ambitious effort to transfer the bad debts of Wall Street, at least temporarily, into the obligations of American taxpayers was first put forward by the administration late last week after a series of bold interventions on behalf of ailing private firms seemed unlikely to prevent a crash of world financial markets. A $700 billion expenditure on distressed mortgage-related assets would roughly be what the country has spent so far in direct costs on the Iraq war and more than the Pentagons total yearly budget appropriation. Divided across the population, it would amount to more than $2,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States. Whatever is spent will add to a budget deficit already projected at more than $500 billion next year. And it comes on top of the $85 billion government rescue of the insurance giant American International Group and a plan to spend up to $200 billion to shore up the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Advertisement Continue reading the main story At his news conference, Mr. Bush also sought to portray the plan as helping every American. The government, he said, needed to send a clear signal that we understood the instability could ripple throughout and affect the working people and the average family, and we werent going to let that happen. A program to help troubled borrowers refinance mortgages  along with an $800 billion increase in the national debt limit  was approved in July. But financing for it depended largely on fees paid by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have been placed into a government conservatorship. Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said in an interview that his staff had already begun working with the Senate banking committee to draft additions to the administrations proposal. Mr. Frank said Democrats were particularly intent on limiting the huge pay packages for corporate executives whose firms seek aid under the new plan, raising the prospect of a contentious battle with the White House. There are going to be federal tax dollars buying up some of the bad paper, Mr. Frank said. They should accept some compensation guidelines, particularly to get rid of the perverse incentives where its heads I win, tails I break even.  Mr. Frank said Democrats were also thinking about tightening the language on the debt limit to make clear that the additional borrowing authority could be used only for the bailout plan. And he said they might seek to revive a proposal that would give bankruptcy judges the authority to modify the terms of primary mortgages, a proposal strongly opposed by the financial industry. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who attended emergency meetings with the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, on Capitol Hill last week, described the proposal as a good start but said it did little for regular Americans. Photo This is a good foundation of a plan that can stabilize markets quickly, Mr. Schumer said in a statement. But it includes no visible protection for taxpayers or homeowners. We look forward to talking to Treasury to see what, if anything, they have in mind in these two areas. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Pelosis statement made clear that she would push for an economic stimulus initiative either as part of the bailout legislation or, more likely, as part of the budget resolution Congress must adopt before adjourning for the fall elections. Such a plan could include an increase in unemployment benefits and spending on infrastructure projects to help create jobs. Some Congressional Republicans warned Democrats not to overreach. The administration has put forward a plan to help the American people, and it is now incumbent on Congress to work together to solve this crisis, said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader. Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Mr. Boehner added, Efforts to exploit this crisis for political leverage or partisan quid pro quo will only delay the economic stability that families, seniors and small businesses deserve. Aides to Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, the Democratic presidential nominee, said he was reviewing the proposal. In Florida, Mr. Obama told voters he would press for a broader economic stimulus. We have to make sure that whatever plan our government comes up with works not just for Wall Street, but for Main Street, Mr. Obama said. We have to make sure it helps folks cope with rising prices, and sparks job creation, and helps homeowners stay in their homes. Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican nominee, issued a statement saying he, too, was reviewing the plan. This financial crisis, Mr. McCain said, requires leadership and action in order to restore a sound foundation to financial markets, get our economy on its feet, and eliminate this burden on hardworking middle-class Americans. If adopted, the bailout plan would sharply raise the stakes for the new administration on the appointment of a new Treasury secretary. The administrations plan would allow the Treasury to hire staff members and engage outside firms to help manage its purchases. And officials said that the administration envisioned enlisting several outside firms to help run the effort to buy up mortgage-related assets. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Officials said that details were still being worked out but that one idea was for the Treasury to hold reverse auctions, in which the government would offer to buy certain classes of distressed assets at a particular price and firms would then decide if they were willing to sell at that price, or could bid the price lower. Mindful of a potential political fight, Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke held a series of conference calls with members of Congress on Friday to begin convincing them that action was needed not just to help Wall Street but everyday Americans as well. Republicans typically supportive of the administration said they were in favor of approving the plan as swiftly as possible. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said in a statement, This proposal is, and should be kept, simple and clear. The majority leader, Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said that the bailout was needed but that Mr. Bush owed the public a fuller explanation. Some lawmakers were more critical or even adamantly opposed to the plan. The free market for all intents and purposes is dead in America, Senator Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky, declared on Friday. It is far from clear how much distressed debt the government will end up purchasing, though it seemed likely that the $700 billion figure was large enough to send a reassuring message to the jittery markets. There are estimates that firms are carrying $1 trillion or more in bad mortgage-related assets. The ultimate price tag of the bailout is virtually impossible to know, in part because of the possibility that taxpayers could profit from the effort, especially if the market stabilizes and real estate prices rise. Lehman Can Sell to Barclays A federal bankruptcy judge decided early Saturday that Lehman Brothers could sell its investment banking and trading businesses to Barclays, the big British bank, the first major step to wind down the nations fourth-largest investment bank. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The judge, James Peck, gave his decision at the end of an eight-hour hearing, which capped a week of financial turmoil. The deal was said to be worth $1.75 billion earlier in the week but the value was in flux after lawyers announced changes to the terms on Friday.

24925,Obama's Remarks at the Associated Press' Annual Meeting,"Obama's Remarks at the Associated Press' Annual Meeting Good afternoon. I know I kept a lot of you guys busy this weekend with the comments I made lastweek. Some of you might even be a little bitter about that. As I said yesterday, I regret some of the words I chose, partly because the way that these remarks have been interpreted have offended some people and partly because they have served as one more distraction from the critical debate that we must have in this election season. I'm a person of deep faith, and my religion has sustained me through a lot in my life. I even gave a speech on faith before I ever started running for President where I said that Democrats, ""make a mistake when we fail to acknowledge the power of faith in people's lives."" I also represent a state with a large number of hunters and sportsmen, and I understand how important these traditions are to families in Illinois and all across America. And, contrary to what my poor word choices may have implied or my opponents have suggested, I've never believed that these traditions or people's faith has anything to do with how much money they have. But I will never walk away from the larger point that I was trying to make. For the last several decades, people in small towns and cities and rural areas all across this country have seen globalization change the rules of the game on them. When I began my career as an organizer on the South Side of Chicago, I saw what happens when the local steel mill shuts its doors and moves overseas. You don't just lose the jobs in the mill, you start losing jobs and businesses throughout the community. The streets are emptier. The schools suffer. I saw it during my campaign for the Senate in Illinois when I'd talk to union guys who had worked at the local Maytag plant for twenty, thirty years before being laid off at fifty-five years old when it picked up and moved to Mexico; and they had no idea what they're going to do without the paycheck or the pension that they counted on. One man didn't even know if he'd be able to afford the liver transplant his son needed now that his health care was gone. I've heard these stories almost every day during this campaign, whether it was in Iowa or Ohio or Pennsylvania. And the people I've met have also told me that every year, in every election, politicians come to their towns, and they tell them what they want to hear, and they make big promises, and then they go back to Washington when the campaign's over, and nothing changes. There's no plan to address the downside of globalization. We don't do anything about the skyrocketing cost of health care or college or those disappearing pensions. Instead of fighting to replace jobs that aren't coming back, Washington ends up fighting over the latest distraction of the week. And after years and years and years of this, a lot of people in this country have become cynical about what government can do to improve their lives. They are angry and frustrated with their leaders for not listening to them; for not fighting for them; for not always telling them the truth. And yes, they are bitter about that. Now, Senator McCain and the Republicans in Washington are already looking ahead to the fall and have decided that they plan on using these comments to argue that I'm out of touch with what's going on in the lives of working Americans. I don't blame them for this -- that's the nature of our political culture, and if I had to carry the banner for eight years of George Bush's failures, I'd be looking for something else to talk about too. But I will say this. If John McCain wants to turn this election into a contest about which party is out of touch with the struggles and the hopes of working America, that's a debate I'm happy to have. In fact, I think that's a debate we need to have. Because I believe that the real insult to the millions of hard-working Americans out there would be a continuation of the economic agenda that has dominated Washington for far too long. I may have made a mistake last week in the words that I chose, but the other party has made a much more damaging mistake in the failed policies they've chosen and the bankrupt philosophy they've embraced for the last three decades. It's a philosophy that says there's no role for government in making the global economy work for working Americas; that we have to just sit back watch those factories close and those jobs disappear; that there's nothing we can do or should do about workers without health care, or children in crumbling schools, or families who are losing their homes, and so we should just hand out a few tax breaks and wish everyone the best of luck. Ronald Reagan called this trickle-down economics. George Bush called it the Ownership Society. But what it really means is that you're on your own. If your premiums or your tuition is rising faster than you can afford, you're on your own. If you're that Maytag worker who just lost his pension, tough luck. If you're a child born into poverty, you'll just have to pull yourself up by your own bootstraps. This philosophy isn't just out-of-touch - it's put our economy out-of-whack. Years of pain on Main Street have finally trickled up to Wall Street and sent us hurtling toward recession, reminding us that we're all connected - that we can't prosper as a nation where a few people are doing well and everyone else is struggling. John McCain is an American hero and a worthy opponent, but he's proven time and time again that he just doesn't understand this. It took him three tries in seven days just to figure out that the home foreclosure crisis was an actual problem. He's had a front row seat to the last eight years of disastrous policies that have widened the income gap and saddled our children with debt, and now he's promising four more years of the very same thing. He's promising to make permanent the Bush tax breaks for the wealthiest few who didn't need them and didn't ask for them - tax breaks that are so irresponsible that John McCain himself once said they offended his conscience. He's promising four more years of trade deals that don't have a single safeguard for American workers - that don't help American workers compete and win in a global economy. He's promising four more years of an Administration that will push for the privatization of Social Security - a plan that would gamble away people's retirement on the stock market; a plan that was already rejected by Democrats and Republicans under George Bush. He's promising four more years of policies that won't guarantee health insurance for working Americans; that won't bring down the rising cost of college tuition; that won't do a thing for the Americans who are living in those communities where the jobs have left and the factories have shut their doors. And yet, despite all this, the other side is still betting that the American people won't notice that John McCain is running for George Bush's third term. They think that they'll forget about all that's happened in the last eight years; that they'll be tricked into believing that it's either me or our party is the one that's out of touch with what's going on in their lives. Well I'm making a different bet. I'm betting on the American people. The men and women I've met in small towns and big cities across this country see this election as a defining moment in our history. They understand what's at stake here because they're living it every day. And they are tired of being distracted by fake controversies. They are fed up with politicians trying to divide us for their own political gain. And I believe they'll see through the tactics that are used every year, in every election, to appeal to our fears, or our biases, or our differences - because they've never wanted or needed change as badly as they do now. The people I've met during this campaign know that government cannot solve all of our problems, and they don't expect it to. They don't want our tax dollars wasted on programs that don't work or perks for special interests who don't work for us. They understand that we cannot stop every job from going overseas or build a wall around our economy, and they know that we shouldn't. But they believe it's finally time that we make health care affordable and available for every single American; that we bring down costs for workers and for businesses; that we cut premiums, and stop insurance companies from denying people care or coverage who need it most. They believe it's time we provided real relief to the victims of this housing crisis; that we help families refinance their mortgage so they can stay in their homes; that we start giving tax relief to the people who actually need it - middle-class families, and seniors, and struggling homeowners. They believe that we can and should make the global economy work for working Americans; that we might not be able to stop every job from going overseas, but we certainly can stop giving tax breaks to companies who send them their and start giving tax breaks to companies who create good jobs right here in America. We can invest in the types of renewable energy that won't just reduce our dependence on oil and save our planet, but create up to five million new jobs that can't be outsourced. They believe we can train our workers for those new jobs, and keep the most productive workforce the most competitive workforce in the world if we fix our public education system by investing in what works and finding out what doesn't; if we invest in early childhood education and finally make college affordable for everyone who wants to go; if we stop talking about how great our teachers are and start rewarding them for their greatness. They believe that if you work your entire life, you deserve to retire with dignity and respect, which means a pension you can count on, and Social Security that's always there. This is what the people I've met believe about the country they love. It doesn't matter if they're Democrats or Republicans; whether they're from the smallest towns or the biggest cities; whether they hunt or they don't; whether they go to church, or temple, or mosque, or not. We may come from different places and have different stories, but we share common hopes, and one very American dream. That is the dream I am running to help restore in this election. If I get the chance, that is what I'll be talking about from now until November. That is the choice that I'll offer the American people - four more years of what we had for the last eight, or fundamental change in Washington. People may be bitter about their leaders and the state of our politics, but beneath that, they are hopeful about what's possible in America. That's why they leave their homes on their day off, or their jobs after a long day of work, and travel - sometimes for miles, sometimes in the bitter cold - to attend a rally or a town hall meeting held by Senator Clinton, or Senator McCain, or myself. Because they believe that we can change things. Because they believe in that dream. I know something about that dream. I wasn't born into a lot of money. I was raised by a single mother with the help my grandparents, who grew up in small-town Kansas, went to school on the GI Bill, and bought their home through an FHA loan. My mother had to use food stamps at one point, but she still made sure that through scholarships, I got a chance to go to some of the best schools around, which helped me get into some of the best colleges around, which gave me loans that Michelle and I just finished paying not all that many years ago. In other words, my story is a quintessentially American story. It's the same story that has made this country a beacon for the world--a story of struggle and sacrifice on the part of my forebearers and a story overcoming great odds. I carry that story with me each and every day, It's why I wake up every day and do this, and it's why I continue to hold such hope for the future of a country where the dreams of its people have always been possible. Thank you.

153,Man finds out he pays Ohio River bridge's electric bill,"Buy Photo Duke Energy charged a Covington business owner to light the Clay Wade Bailey bridge across the Ohio River for five months. (Photo: The Enquirer/Cara Owsley)Buy Photo COVINGTON, Ky.  Business owner Marty Boyer accidentally paid the electric bill for lights on the Clay Wade Bailey Bridge for five months. Boyer was charged based on electrical poles across West Third Street from the Theatre House in Covington, a business he acquired in November. The poles supply electricity for lights on the Ohio River bridge, Duke Energy acknowledged Monday after Boyer made a ""plea for help"" on social media. Boyer noticed in January the bill seemed too high. Plus, there were more meters than his business, a theatrical supply house, would require. He started calling Duke in January. Frustrated by Duke's inaction, Boyer told Duke to turn off the meters across the street on March 19 not knowing what they powered. The lights stayed on at the Theatre House, but a Duke worker showed up the next day asking who turned the lights off. ""(The) lesson here: Want to get attention, turn off the lighting on the bridge,"" Boyer said. The billing error  which was costing Boyer about $200 a month  persisted until it was brought to Duke Energy's attention Monday by The Enquirer. Earlier Monday Boyer vented about his dilemma on Facebook, fed up with inaction from Duke customer service. Duke Energy called the Theatre House owner Monday to apologize, said Sally Thelen, a company spokeswoman. ""We were very apologetic and acknowledged that we can do better,"" Thelen said. The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, responsible for the bridge lighting, was supposed to be billed. Duke can and will do better, Thelen said. This will be a ""teachable"" moment, she said. ""Definitely there were some issues on our end about how we were handling instances of his billing,"" she said. Covington's Theatre House owner Marty Boyer says his company was charged for three utility poles across West Third Street that help light the Clay Wade Bailey Bridge. (Photo: Provided/Marty Boyer) Boyer estimates he spent at least 25 hours trying to talk with employees to stop billing him for the bridge lighting since he first complained in January. Boyer said he was told Duke couldn't find someone to bill at the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet. Duke asked him to call the Transportation Cabinet. Covington's Theatre House owner Marty Boyer says his company was charged for three utility poles across West Third Street that help light the Clay Wade Bailey Bridge.

566,"House Approves GOP Tax Overhaul, With Senate Outlook Uncertain","House Approves GOP Tax Overhaul, With Senate Outlook Uncertain Enlarge this image toggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP Jacquelyn Martin/AP The House has narrowly approved a $1.4 trillion tax overhaul, clearing the first major hurdle in Republican attempts to cut taxes and rewrite the tax code. The vote was almost along party lines, with no Democrats voting in support of the bill and some GOP defections over provisions in the measure that would eliminate important tax deductions taken by constituents in some high tax states. ""It has been 31 years since we last did this, and it is finally time that we get the general interest of this country to prevail over the special interests in Washington,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan said on the House floor, pledging that the bill would leader to faster economic growth and bigger paychecks for American workers. The last major tax overhaul took place in 1986 under President Ronald Reagan, with a Republican-controlled Senate and Democrat-controlled House. President Trump made a rare appearance at the Capitol to rally GOP lawmakers in advance of the vote. ""It was a good meeting. Taxes are going really well,"" Trump told reporters. The 440-page legislation would reduce the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, winning support from outside groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Business. But its effect on individuals is less dramatic. It reduces from seven to four the number of tax brackets and doubles the standard deduction, while eliminating many other deductions and credits. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has an extensive breakdown of the measure. The Senate is considering its own tax overhaul, which is still in committee. In recent days, it has been altered so that tax rates for individuals would be reduced only temporarily while corporate tax rates would be cut permanently. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson said he is against the bill in its current form because the cuts that would be temporary would also impact small businesses that pay their taxes through individual rates. The Senate bill would also now include a provision to zero out the individual mandate penalty, one of the pillars of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, expressed reservations over this move. She is one of the Republicans who blocked efforts to repeal Obamacare this year. GOP leaders, prodded by the president, hope to agree on and approve a final tax bill by the end of the year, showing voters a major accomplishment in the first year of their majority after failing repeatedly on health care.",TRUE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/does-the-republican-tax-bill-include-a-loophole-benefitting-golf-course-owners/,Economy,Snopes
670,Customers Outraged After Buffalo Wild Wings Employee Silences National Anthem,"EASTVALE   The National Anthem is the focus of controversy again, this time at a bar in Riverside County. Customers at a Buffalo Wild Wings in Eastvale say an employee refused to let them hear the anthem before an NFL game Monday night  which happened to be the 16th anniversary of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. A customer who identified herself as Lori said the employee refused to play the sound of the anthem for one game, but played it for the game before. When he was asked why, the employee  who was not identified  said the anthem is too controversial, and it was company policy not to play it. No one understood what was so controversial. Its 9/11, its a sporting event, why is it controversial? she said. Lori took the employees picture and posted it on social media, where it spread quickly. She said a manager on Monday apologized immediately for that employees behavior. The franchise owner also apologized in a statement and said the company has no policy regarding the matter.",TRUE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/buffalo-wild-wings-anthem/,Economy,Snopes
1088,The 2016 Haters Guide To The Williams-Sonoma Catalog,"I was on the Jersey Turnpike when I saw it. I was driving my family to New York for Thanksgiving and there, along the shittiest stretch of road in the shittiest state in America, I saw the Williams-Sonoma fulfillment center: a vast hangar that seemed to stretch a mile long, with shipping containers lined up along the side, like piglets feeding on a series of artisanal teats. It was located in a town called Cranbury because of course it fucking was. It made me wonder if Williams-Sonoma chose the town of Cranbury specifically for the whimsy of it, or if they CREATED the town and christened it Cranbury just so that it could match their mission statement of bringing holiday cheer and $75 baskets of glazed figs to the world. And I wont lie, it was kind of nice to see the fulfillment center, to see just where the (imported, dry-aged Portuguese) sausage (with white wine and fennel) is made. This has not been a pleasant year. Everyone good died. America is now a bad sitcom flash forward episode. And I got a camera up my dick. So it was nice to see all those trucks lined up in Cranbury, each one getting its marching orders to drive out to some pristine house on some pristine cul-de-sac in some pristine suburb. Call it Peppermintbarkvillea place that the rest of the world cannot touch, where even a nuclear holocaust could not intrude upon the bestowing of gold napkin rings and cheese assortments. Life as we know may end, but the Williams-Sonoma catalog, and the army of little Ina Gartens who have seemingly unlimited cash to spend on its wares, will endure. They shall adorn their houses in the finest garlands and pass around only the choicest amuse bouches, and everything will be PERFECT even as the world burns a mile away. OH, ITLL BE SO GRAND THAT YOULL WANNA PUKE. Advertisement So come with me now. Lets forget about our troubles, crack open this years W-S Christmas catalog, and lose ourselves in a tartan wonderland.

Drew says: Fuck table runners. There, I said it. A table runner is nothing more than an unfinished tablecloth. Sometimes people put the runner OVER the tablecloth, which increases the chances of your kid attempting a magic trick by 75%. Also, setting food down on a table with a runner is a mess. Half the platter is on the runner while the other half is on the bare surface. Now everything is all tilted like a bad table at Noodles & Company. AGONY.

Advertisement By the way, can we talk about how useless fancy corkscrews are? Theyre hideously expensive and take up way too much room. More important, anyone who relies on some stupid electric corkscrew is not a REAL MAN. A real man uses a rusty Swiss Army Knife and opens that bottle of Sauvignon Blanc using nothing more than pure grit and steel biceps. Then the cork crumbles halfway through the pull, and you get angry and smash the bottle on the counter in a fit of rage, and then everyone knows that you are NOT a man to be fucked with.

Not only is it the perfect prop for any spoiled brat (Little Priscilla here just LOVES her big lollipops and her novelty Barbie Porsche), but most kids take forever to eat any lollipop, even very small ones.

I then tried to top my mug with it. Look at this shit: Advertisement Look at that big dumb house hanging off the side of my coffee cup. Im embarrassed for the cup.

Even with Williams-Sonoma openly trying to peppermint barkify the entire globe, I wouldnt kick those cookies off my Twas The Night Before Christmas cookie platter. By the way, if you just want the crushed candy cane topping, you can buy a container of peppermint snow from Williams-Sonoma for $18.95. You can hand-appliqu your cookies with it!

Drew says: As always, there is nothing rich people love more than eating fancy versions of white trash food. Its franks and beans, but the beans are imported from Tuscany and the franks are actually made from Japanese HegWu beef. Such whimsy! NINETY DOLLARS PER PIECE.

I refuse to believe that one goddamn apple can be neatly divided into 16 servings. And if it really can, then I want a Congressional inquiry into these monster apples. Perhaps Williams-Sonoma has genetically engineered their own patented kind of Giant Fuji apple that can orbit the goddamn sun.

If you use truffle oil on ANY dish, Geoffrey Zakarian appears in a cloud of silver fog in your kitchen and slaps the living shit out of you.

1315,"Answer Man: Nectar Lounge fate, Nutz R Us mental health","The former Northside Grill will host a new yoga studio, slated to open Feb. 28, as well as a restaurant downstairs called Nectar. (Photo: Citizen-Times file photo) Today's batch of burning questions, my smart-aleck answers and the real deal: Question: What ever happened to the Nectar Lounge where Northside Grill used to be? There was so much hype, that it was going to open in August or September and there'd be a yoga studio, etc., upstairs. The website listed in the C-T article doesn't exist, and their Facebook page postings stopped in August. Just wondering. Healthy food on the north side is a good thing. My answer: Seriously, can you get more Asheville than a combo yoga studio/nectar lounge? I wonder if it would've been a hookah-style setup, with folks literally sipping nectar from huge, suspended vases from the ceilings. Real answer: Indeed, plans have changed. ""OK, so Centerpoint Discovery and Nectar Lounge never happened,"" Jaime Hadnagy, who was slated to be general manager of the business, told me via email. "" I left the project in the end of August, and soon after that, the project ended. Since then, there has been a shift in ownership. Also, the concept has changed slightly."" Hadnagy said she's working on the launch of Veda Studios in the upstairs, and the opening is slated for Feb. 28, ""and there will be free classes all day. Yay!"" ""Veda Studios is a movement studio offering yoga, dance and martial arts,"" Hadnagy said. ""As far as the downstairs, the restaurant is now being called Nectar. It is opening in the next few months and is a sister business to Veda Studios. The menu will still include raw food and juice, but they decided to add a dinner menu, which is farm-to-table Chinese food. There is a better energy now, and it is exciting that things are moving and more importantly there is an opening date!!"" I could feel the energy through the computer screen. Good luck! Question: So, this inquiry comes from a psychiatrist at Broughton Hospital in Morganton, Dr. Suzannah McCuen, who a few weeks back sent us a letter questioning the name choice of a local company. ""I learned today that a company in the Buncombe County area whose business it is to provide care facilities for the mentally ill is called Nutz R Us,"" McCuen said. ""I found that hard to believe and so Googled them and called one of their homes, White Fawn. The woman who answered the phone verified that Nutz R Us is the corporate name. She seemed to think that using a ""z"" in the spelling mitigated the harm, I suppose, as she pointed that out to me. An online search reveals this company runs several homes in the area. While I am grateful that this company is providing homes for the mentally ill, I find their choice of a company name offensive, to say the least. I am hopeful that some public exposure will convince them to change the company name while still endeavoring to provide much needed services and homes for the mentally ill in Western North Carolina."" My answer: I attempted a similar softening of an inappropriate phrase one time with one of my editors. Let me tell you, it didn't fly. Real answer: I didn't have much more luck than the good doctor in getting hold of someone with the company. I left multiple messages in January and last week with the administrator and at the White Fawn home, and I've not heard anything back. I don't think McCuen is going to let this go. She's alerted a patient advocacy organization and the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill. Businesses often use colorful parent company names  I know one or two that would not be appropriate for a family newspaper. But this one does seem a bit tin-eared for a mental health provider.

1436,Customer Letter,"The San Bernardino Case We were shocked and outraged by the deadly act of terrorism in San Bernardino last December. We mourn the loss of life and want justice for all those whose lives were affected. The FBI asked us for help in the days following the attack, and we have worked hard to support the governments efforts to solve this horrible crime. We have no sympathy for terrorists. When the FBI has requested data thats in our possession, we have provided it. Apple complies with valid subpoenas and search warrants, as we have in the San Bernardino case. We have also made Apple engineers available to advise the FBI, and weve offered our best ideas on a number of investigative options at their disposal. We have great respect for the professionals at the FBI, and we believe their intentions are good. Up to this point, we have done everything that is both within our power and within the law to help them. But now the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone. Specifically, the FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on an iPhone recovered during the investigation. In the wrong hands, this software  which does not exist today  would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someones physical possession. The FBI may use different words to describe this tool, but make no mistake: Building a version of iOS that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a backdoor. And while the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control.",TRUE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/apple-letter-san-bernardino/,Economy,Snopes

8731,Starbucks Support of the Troops/Military,"Starbucks Support of the Troops/Military January 11, 2005 (updated November 2013) On behalf of Starbucks more than 200,000 dedicated partners (employees), we want to set the record straight on an old rumor concerning our companys lack of support for the military and our troops. This rumor, dating back to 2004, claims a lack of Starbucks support for the U.S. Marines, and has evolved to include a lack of support for the British Royal Marines. In both instances, the rumor is not, and has never been, true. When Starbucks learned of the original email, we immediately contacted the author, a Marine Sergeant, who subsequently sent an email to his original distribution list correcting the mistake. Unfortunately, rumors have a way of continuing even after the truth has been revealed. At Starbucks, we respect the efforts of the men and women who serve their country in the military  including our fellow partners who serve during this time of war. In fact, Starbucks recently made a strategic business decision to hire thousands of veterans and active duty military spouses over the next 5 years, given the unique skills and talents weve seen them bring to our workplace. Like Starbucks, the members of the U.S. military and their spouses share our passion for mission-driven leadership and service, and they exemplify the kinds of partners Starbucks wants to have as part of our team. In addition to our strategic hiring focus on veterans and active duty spouses, we have also made a commitment to expand our community store model with five military communities over the next five years in the U.S. Starting with stores in Lakewood, WA near Joint Base Lewis-McChord and in San Antonio, TX near Joint Base San Antonio, we will convert existing stores to community stores to share a portion of their profits to fund local non-profit programs that help veterans re-entering the workforce. Starbucks also has partnered with the American Red Cross and the United Service Organizations (USO) to provide coffee to relief efforts during times of conflict, donating more than 141,000 lbs of coffee and over one million 3-packs of Starbucks VIA. Additionally, troops all over the world are enjoying Starbucks VIA Ready Brew in care packages they receive not only from Starbucks, but from their family and friends as well. Last year, Starbucks provided over 220,000 3-packs of Starbucks VIA to the USO for their care package program.

10160,Sophia Stewart wins the Matrix copyright infringement case,"New York, Nov 11 (THAINDIAN NEWS) Sophia Stewart an African American who claimed to be the author of The Matrix will finally receive her just due from the copyright infringement of her original work, as the copyright case is finally settled in court. A six-year dispute has ended which involved Sophia Stewart, the Wachowski Brothers, Joel Silver and Warner Brothers. Sophia Stewarts allegations, involving copyright infringement and racketeering, were well received and completely acknowledged by the Central District of California, where the Judge Margaret Morrow was presiding. Sophie Stewart had filed her copyright infringement case 10 years ago, in 1999, after viewing the acclaimed movie Matrix, which she felt had been based on her manuscript, The Third Eye, copyrighted in 1981. In the mid-eighties Stewart had submitted her manuscript to an advertisement placed by the Wachowski Brothers, requesting new sci-fi works, which could be later made into a movie. According to court documentation, an FBI investigation discovered that more than thirty minutes had been edited from the original film, in an attempt to avoid penalties for copyright infringement. The investigation also stated that credible witnesses employed at Warner Brothers came forward, claiming that the executives and lawyers had full knowledge that the work in question did not belong to the Wachowski Brothers. These witnesses claimed to have seen Stewarts original work and that it had been often used during preparation of the motion pictures. The defendants tried, on several occasions, to have Stewarts case dismissed, without success. Sophia Stewarts released a press statement which said: The Matrix & Terminator movie franchises have made world history and have ultimately changed the way people view movies and how Hollywood does business, yet the real truth about the creator and creation of these films continue to elude the masses because the hidden secret of the matter is that these films were created and written by a Black womana Black woman named Sophia Stewart. But Hollywood does not want you to know this fact simply because it would change history. Also it would encourage our Black children to realize a dream and that isnothing is impossible for them to achieve!",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/sophia-stewart-matrix-lawsuit/,Economy,Snopes
11137,Disabled Borrowers May Have Student Loans Forgiven,"On 12 April 2016, the U.S. Department of Education announced that hundreds of thousands of borrowers who are permanently disabled could have an estimated $7.7 billion in student loans forgiven: The U.S. Department of Education announced today a new process to proactively identify and assist federal student loan borrowers with disabilities who may be eligible for Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) loan discharge. This effort was called for by President Obama in his Student Aid Bill of Rights, which details measures to make paying for higher education an easier and fairer experience for millions of Americans. The Higher Education Act allows for loan forgiveness for borrowers who are totally and permanently disabled. By proactively identifying and engaging borrowers who may be eligible for TPD loan discharge, the Department is fulfilling its commitment to ensure that borrowers who are totally and permanently disabled have the information needed to take full advantage of the debt relief to which they are entitled. In 2012, the Administration took steps to streamline the process to allow for Americans who are totally and permanently disabled to use their Social Security designation to apply to have their loans discharged. But too many eligible borrowers were falling through the cracks, unaware they were eligible for relief. Borrowers like one such woman whose side effects from her breast cancer treatment left her totally and permanently disabled. After repeated attempts, she finally received a disability dischargeseven years after her first application, said U.S. Education Under Secretary Ted Mitchell. Under the new process, we will notify potentially eligible borrowers about the benefit and guide them through steps needed to discharge their loans, helping thousands of borrowers. Americans with disabilities have a right to student loan relief. And we need to make it easier, not harder, for them to receive the benefits they are due. As part of President Obamas Student Aid Bill of Rights  a move to help relieve Americans of crushing student loan debt  the Department of Education will be sending letters to 387,000 people who have been identified as eligible for a Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) loan discharge because they are disabled and cannot work. The Department of Education and Social Security Administration are working together to identify borrowers who have been receiving disability payments and are eligible to have their loans discharged. Those borrowers will be able to bypass the traditional disability discharge process, which requires them to furnish proof of their disability. Instead, these disabled borrowers will be able to simply fill out and sign the application sent to them in the letter they receive from the Department of Education.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/student-loan-forgiveness-scam/,Economy,Snopes
11777,Woman accused of giving husband lethal sherry enema,"Woman accused of giving husband lethal sherry enema HOUSTON -- Investigators say a woman caused her husband's death by giving him a sherry enema, leading to alcohol poisoning. The enema caused his blood alcohol level to soar to 0.47 percent -- almost six times the legal intoxication limit in Texas, a toxicology report showed. Tammy Jean Warner, 42, was indicted on a charge of negligent homicide. She is also charged with burning the will of her husband, Michael Warner, a month before his death on May 21. Michael Warner, a 58-year-old machine shop owner, had a long history of alcoholism but couldn't ingest alcohol by mouth because of painful medical problems with his throat, said Lake Jackson, Texas, police detective Robert Turner. The enema was a way he could become intoxicated without drinking alcohol, Turner said. ""I heard of this kind of thing in mortuary school in 1970, but this is the first time I've ever heard of someone actually doing it,"" Turner said.

""We're not talking about little bottles here,"" Turner said, ""These were at least 1.5-liter bottles."" Turner said police don't know if the victim had ever become intoxicated in that manner before the lethal incident. Tammy Warner told police that she found her husband dead in their bed. Turner said she admitted giving him the sherry enema, but not to causing his death. ""A person drinking alcohol will usually pass out before getting a lethal dose,"" Turner said. ""But if you're getting it through an enema, you can pass out and still be ingesting more alcohol."" Tammy Warner surrendered to Lake Jackson police Monday and was released on $30,000 bond. She could not be reached for comment Wednesday. Neither Turner nor Brazoria County District Attorney Jeri Yenne would comment on the charge related to the will. The indictment said providing Michael Warner with alcohol and destroying the will constituted a ""criminal episode."" Although Michael Warner may have agreed initially to the enema as a way to become intoxicated, Yenne said, ""he was not a willing participant in something that would cause his death."" ""He knew that it was very dangerous for him to have any form of alcohol and she knew it was very dangerous for him to have alcohol,"" Yenne said. The couple's neighbors said they were surprised Wednesday to learn of the indictment. John Criswell, 24, said the widow had mostly been away from the modest brown frame house at the end of the street since her husband died. ""She said she was scared to stay there by herself alone,"" Criswell said. ""She said she'd been having trouble with his family."" The couple had been married about two years, police said.

12151,8 FAQs about EMV credit cards,"Credit Cards  Credit Card News  8 FAQs about EMV credit cards 8 FAQs about EMV credit cards Chip? PIN? Signature? Do old cards work? Answers to frequently asked questions Personal finance writer Statistics enthusiast focused on data-driven content Its been almost two years since the nationwide shift to EMV officially began. EMV -- which stands for Europay, Mastercard and Visa -- is a global standard for cards equipped with computer chips and the technology used to authenticate chip-card transactions. In the wake of numerous large-scale data breaches and increasing rates of counterfeit card fraud, U.S. card issuers have migrated to this new technology to protect consumers and reduce the costs of fraud. ""These new and improved cards are being deployed to improve payment security, making it more difficult for fraudsters to successfully counterfeit cards,"" says Julie Conroy, research director for retail banking at Aite Group, a financial industry research company. ""It's an important step forward."" For merchants and financial institutions, the switch to EMV means adding new in-store technology and internal processing systems, and complying with new liability rules. For consumers, it means learning a new payment processes. Want to know more about the ongoing transition and your EMV chip-equipped credit card? Here are eight frequently asked questions to help you understand the changes. 1. Why are EMV cards more secure than traditional cards? It's that small, metallic square you'll see on new cards. That's a computer chip, and it's what sets it apart the new generation of cards. The magnetic stripes on traditional credit and debit cards store contain unchanging data. Whoever accesses that data gains the sensitive card and cardholder information necessary to make purchases. That makes traditional cards prime targets for counterfeiters, who convert stolen card data to cash. ""If someone copies a mag stripe, they can easily replicate that data over and over again because it doesn't change,"" says Dave Witts, president of U.S. payment systems for Creditcall, a payment gateway and EMV software developer. Unlike magnetic-stripe cards, every time an EMV card is used for payment, the card chip creates a unique transaction code that cannot be used again. If a hacker stole the chip information from one specific point of sale, typical card duplication would never work ""because the stolen transaction number created in that instance wouldn't be usable again and the card would just get denied,"" Witts says. EMV technology will not prevent data breaches from occurring, but it will make it much harder for criminals to successfully profit from what they steal. Experts hope it will help significantly reduce fraud in the U.S., which has doubled in the past seven years as criminals have shied away from countries that already have transitioned to EMV cards, Conroy says. ""The introduction of dynamic data is what makes EMV cards so effective at bringing down counterfeit card rates in other countries,"" she says. Counterfeit fraud rates have already decreased in the U.S. as a result of EMV adoption, according to Mastercard and Visa. In March 2017, chip-enabled merchants saw a 58 percent drop in counterfeit fraud compared to a year earlier, according to Visa. Mastercard noticed a difference even earlier: It recorded a 54 percent decrease in counterfeit fraud costs among its EMV-ready merchants from April 2015 to April 2016. How EMV chips are made Microcomputers on your credit cards A look behind the scenes at an ultra-secure credit card factory where small but complex smart card chips are made. Microcomputers on your credit cardsA look behind the scenes at an ultra-secure credit card factory where small but complex smart card chips are made. See more 2. How do I use an EMV card to make a purchase? Just like magnetic-stripe cards, EMV cards are processed for payment in two steps: card reading and transaction verification. However, with EMV cards you no longer have to master a quick, fluid card swipe in the right direction. Chip cards are read in a different way. ""Instead of going to a register and swiping your card, you are going to do what is called 'card dipping' instead, which means inserting your card into a terminal slot and waiting for it to process,"" Conroy says. When an EMV card is dipped, data flows between the card chip and the issuing financial institution to verify the card's legitimacy and create the unique transaction data. This process isn't as quick as a magnetic-stripe swipe. ""It will take a tiny bit longer for that transmission of data to happen,"" Witts says. ""If a person just sticks the card in and pulls it out, the transaction will likely be denied. A little bit of patience will be involved."" While chip card transactions may take a bit longer than mag stripe transactions, total card processing time will vary between merchants and eventually speed up as the new payment environment is improved. It will vary depending on the merchant, the equipment and the point-of-sale system, Ferenczi said. I think that time lag overtime will be reduced for those longer transactions. For more information about current EMV transaction speeds, see The big chip card switch: a year of living with EMV. Wait, what's the card called? The new EMV cards in the U.S. might be called any of the following terms: Smart card Chip card Smart-chip card Chip-enabled smart card Chip-and-choice card (PIN or signature) EMV smart card EMV card 3. Is card dipping the only option? Not necessarily. EMV cards can also support contactless card reading, also known as near field communication. Instead of dipping or swiping, NFC-equipped cards are tapped against a terminal scanner that can pick up the card data from the embedded computer chip. ""Contactless transactions are more consumer-friendly because you just have to tap,"" said Martin Ferenczi, president of Oberthur Technologies, the leading global EMV product and service provider. ""Around the world, there is a move to make EMV cards dual-interface, which means contact and contactless. However, in the U.S., most financial instructions are issuing contact cards."" Dual-interface cards and the equipment needed to scan them are expensive. Right now, the first step is to successfully integrate EMV cards into the U.S. shopping scene. Dual interface will arrive later, although they are in production and rolling out slowly now, according to Ferenczi. Dual-interface cards, which in 2016 represented less than 5 percent of total EMV cards in the U.S., will have significant growth in 2017, Ferenczi said. Issuers want to offer their cardholders the added level of speed and convenience provided by tapping. 4. Will I still have to sign or enter a PIN for my card transaction? Yes and no. You will have to do one of those verification methods, but it depends on the verification method tied to your EMV card, not if your card is debit or credit. Chip-and-PIN cards operate just like the checking-account debit card you have been using for years. Entering a PIN connects the payment terminal to the payment processor for real-time transaction verification and approval. However, many payment processors are not equipped with the technology needed to handle EMV chip-and-PIN credit transactions. So it is not likely you will have to memorize new PINs anytime soon, according to Conroy. ""There aren't going to be many issuers requiring a PIN,"" she says. ""A vast majority will be issuing chip-and-signature cards, which aren't all that different from how credit cards work now."" As with a magnetic-stripe credit card, you sign on the point-of-sale terminal to take responsibility for the payment when making a chip-and-signature card transaction. U.S. chip-and-PIN cards will be transitioned in slowly, according to Ferenczi. ""The card production demand today is really based on chip-and-signature cards,"" he says. ""It will probably take two to three years to fully convert to chip-and-PIN."" Despite a slow transition overall, those who get chip-and-PIN cards will be able to use them right away. ""If a terminal doesn't have the ability to accept a PIN, it will then step down to accepting a signature,"" says Randy Vanderhoof, executive director of the Smart Card Alliance. ""There will always be a secondary option."" Chip cards, by the numbers The Numbers 855 million: Estimated number of chip cards issued to U.S. consumers so far, per U.S. Payments Forum estimates 85%: Estimated percentage of all U.S. credit cards issued with chips at the end of July 2017, per CPI Card Group 60%: Percentage of U.S. debit cards issued with chips by the end of July 2017, per CPI Card Group $2-$4: Approximately cost of issuing a new EMV card, per First Data 15 million: Estimated total number of point-of-sale terminals that have to be upgraded to accept chip cards, per Javelin Research & Strategy $6.75 billion: Estimated cost of replacing the 15 million POS terminals with chip card-compliant machines, per Javelin Research & Strategy 50-52%: Estimated percentage of merchant locations currently ready to process chip card payments, per Visa, U.S. Payments Forum and Strawhecker Group estimates 1.81-2.3 million: Estimated number of U.S. point-of-sale terminals enabled to accept chip card payments, per Mastercard and Visa estimates. 5. If fraud occurs after EMV cards are issued, who will be liable for the costs? If an in-store transaction is conducted using a counterfeit, stolen or otherwise compromised card, consumer losses from that transaction fall back on the payment processor or issuing bank, depending on the card's terms and conditions. Since the Oct. 1, 2015 deadline created by major U.S. credit card issuers Mastercard, Visa, Discover and American Express, the liability for card-present fraud has shifted to whichever party is the least EMV-compliant in a fraudulent transaction. Consider the example of a financial institution that issues a chip card used at a merchant that has not changed its system to accept chip technology. This allows a counterfeit card to be successfully used. ""The cost of the fraud will fall back on the merchant,"" Ferenczi says. The change is intended to help bring the entire payment industry on board with EMV by encouraging compliance to avoid liability costs. Today, any parties not EMV-ready could face much higher costs in the event of a large data breach. Until recently, automated fuel dispensers had until 2017 to make the shift to EMV. However, a December 2016 Visa and Mastercard agreement now gives pay-at-the-pump gas terminals until October 2020 to become EMV-compliant. Given the migration challenges for implementing EMV in the petroleum environment, Visa's and Mastercards modification of the liability shift dates will be beneficial to the retail petroleum industry and the U.S. chip migration, Vanderhoof explained in an emailed statement. So for now, gas stations do not fall under the existing EMV fraud liability shift rules. ATMs still have two fraud liability shift dates: Mastercards that passed in October 2016 and Visas in October 2017. Until both dates pass, ATMs will follow existing fraud liability rulings. See ATMs changing to accept EMV chip cards for more ATM migration information. 6. So since Oct. 1, 2015, is the transition to EMV technology complete? Not yet. Although the deadline was strong encouragement for all payment processing parties to become EMV-compliant as soon as possible, not everyone has made the transition yet. Most countries that migrated to EMV have four or five banks that issue cards and a couple of acquirers that provide a service to merchants, said Jason Oxman, chief executive officer of the Electronic Transactions Association. We have 13,000 financial institutions in the U.S. that issue credit and debit cards, and we have 5 million merchant locations in the U.S. that accept debit and credit cards. So its a massive undertaking. EMV debit cards have rolled out at a slower pace. Approximately 25 percent of U.S. debit cards were issued as EMV chip cards by the end of 2015, according to Mercator Advisory Groups Sarah Grotta, director of Debit Advisory Service. That ratio rose to 33 percent by the end of June 2016, and today, approximately 60 percent of issuer's debit cards are EMV chip-equipped, according to CPI Card Group estimates. EMV debit cards are slowly being issued because banks have to prep their software to accept those new cards as well, according to Ferenczi. The majority of chip cards in the hands of cardholders today have come from larger issuers auch as Bank of America and Chase, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. The cost of this EMV transition is causing smaller banks to convert their cards more slowly. The EMV credit card rollout, however, is progressing steadily. More than 449 million Visa chip cards have been issued in the U.S. overall so far, as of June 2017. About 68 percent of Mastercard-branded credit and debit cards have been issued with chips so far, as of Oct. 1, 2016. For all U.S. credit cards, CPI Card Group estimates approximately 85 percent of cards now have chips on them. Overall, 70 percent of cards (debit and credit) have been converted to EMV, per CPI Card Group. If some of the cards in your wallet have yet to be issued with chips, don't fret. ""Different companies have different rollout strategies,"" says Doug Johnson, vice president of risk management policy for the American Bankers Association. Some will base their actions on card expiration dates; others will work to get chip cards into the consumer's hands as soon as possible. I think the progress we are seeing today is promising, said Chiro Aikat, senior vice president of product delivery (EMV) at Mastercard. What about mobile payment readers? EMV-compatible card readers for Android and iOS devices that can read contactless mobile payments and process dipped chip cards. Merchants can purchase the devices for $49. 7. If I want to use my chip-card at a retailer that doesn't support EMV technology yet, will it work? Yes. The first round of EMV cards -- many of which are in consumers' hands -- will be equipped with both chip and magnetic-stripe functions so consumer spending is not disrupted and merchants can adjust. If you find yourself at a point-of-sale terminal and are not sure whether to dip or swipe your card, have no fear. The terminal will walk you through the process. ""For example, if you enter a card into the chip reader slot but the reader isn't activated yet, it will come up with an error and you'll be prompted to swipe the card in order to use it,"" Vanderhoof says. And vice-versa. ""If a consumer tries to swipe a chip card instead of inserting it, an error will appear and they will be prompted to insert the card for chip processing instead,"" Vanderhoof says. If chip-card readers are not in place at a merchant at all, your EMV card can be read with a swipe, just like a traditional magnetic-stripe card. ""You can still conduct transactions, you just lose that extra level of chip security,"" Johnson says. See Mag stripe begins its farewell tour for details about the move away from magnetic stripe cards. While many large retailers, such as Walmart, Target and Costco, have upgraded their POS terminals and have activated them for chip card acceptance, many U.S. retail locations are still not EMV-ready. Visa says 50 percent of U.S. stores (approximately 2.3 million merchant locations) now accept chip cards, as of June 2017. Mastercard has tallied 2.3 million chip-active merchant locations on its network, representing 38 percent of all U.S. merchants back in October 2016. Industry experts expect the merchant migration to slowly continue over the next few years, especially as the remaining liability shift dates get closer. I expect to see a slow and gradual increase of merchant moving over, just like weve seen up until today, as each merchant makes an assessment if this expenditure makes sense for them and their particular business, said Mallory Duncan, senior vice president and general counsel at the National Retail Federation. In July 2017, U.S. Payments Forum estimated 45 to 50 percent of U.S. credit and debit card transactions were chip-on-chip. See ""7 merchant tips to understanding EMV fraud liability shift"" for answers to additional liability shift questions. 8. Will I be able to use my EMV card when I travel outside the country? Yes and no. The U.S. is the last major market still using the magnetic-stripe card system. Many European countries moved to EMV technology years ago to combat high fraud rates. That shift has left many U.S. consumers who have magnetic-stripe cards looking for other forms of payment when they travel. Since many foreign merchants are wary of magnetic-stripe cards, consumers who hold some type of chip card may run into fewer issues than those without one, according to Ferenczi. ""Just the existence of the chip will likely make European merchants more willing to accept transactions that they wouldn't have likely accepted if a customer presented a mag-stripe card,"" he say, which is good news for traveling U.S. cardholders. However, chip-and-PIN cards are the norm in most other countries that support EMV technology. So consumers with chip-and-signature cards may find some merchants who are unwilling or unable to process their card, even though it does have an embedded chip. But despite any difficulties in the transition, Ferenczi says the change is a step in the right direction. ""Nobody likes to think that his or her card is being secretly used for other purposes,"" he says. ""So I think regardless, there is a level of comfort knowing that it will be far more difficult to counterfeit EMV cards.""

12291,Is Your Semen Volume Normal? Here's How to Tell.,"Is your semen volume normal? If you're producing less than a third of a teaspoon, it might be time to get checked for underlying health problems Low semen volume could be a sign of health issues like low testosterone or diabetes. Some of the causes of low semen volume are treatable, so don't be afraid to bring up the topic with your doctor. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Of course youve measured your penis to see how your member matches up, but youve probably never taken the steps to actually quantify how your after-sex eruptions compare to those of other dudes. But still, it might have crossed your mind: Is the amount youre ejaculating normal? Lots of guys worry about whether the volume of their ejaculate is cause for concern, says Daniel Williams, M.D., an associate professor in the department of urology and director of male reproductive medicine and microsurgery at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. According to parameters developed by the World Health Organization Even if your eruptions dont quite hit that benchmark, you still might be perfectly normal. But if youre only producing 1.5 ml or less of the sticky stuff  less than one-third of a teaspoon  thats when you may need further evaluation. Levels under that  or having a noticeable change  can raise your suspicion that a man may have an underlying issue thats contributing to the low volume of his ejaculate, Dr. Williams says. Is low semen volume definitely a problem? Just as erectile function declines with age, ejaculation volume generally follows a similar course, Dr. Williams says. So if youve been noticing a gradual decrease in the amount that youre spurting, say, over the last 5 or 10 years, it might just be a normal, age-related decline. And this can actually start in any decade of life. In some men, it can start in their 20s and 30s, but most men may not notice any changes until later on, he says. Whats more concerning is if you notice a sudden difference in the amount you ejaculate. This can signal something else is going on.

Youre probably familiar with something called hypogonadism, the official term for low testosterone. Along with making it hard to, well, get hard, low T can also decrease the amount of ejaculate youre producing. You may also feel nonspecific symptoms like fatigue, weakness, or trouble concentrating  all factors that should prompt your doc to check you for low testosterone, Dr. Williams says. Other sneaky signs of low T include your sex drive disappearing and your penis, scrotum, and testicles shrinking. Getty Images Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Advertisement - Continue Reading Below One condition you may not have thought about, though, is diabetes. If your blood sugar has been haywire for a while, it can damage the nerves and your blood vessels. This can make it harder for the nerve signals to communicate, which may result in erectile dysfunction and ejaculation problems. Diabetics are also more likely to develop a surprising condition called retrograde ejaculation, where the semen spurts back into the bladder instead of out the tip of the penis. Other neurological problems, such as multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injuries, can also cause low semen volume in a similar way. You may also notice a decrease in the volume of your ejaculations if you have an enlarged prostate, take meds like alpha blockers  which treat high blood pressure or urinary problems  or if youve recently had an abdominal surgery. Getty Advertisement - Continue Reading Below What should you do if you think your semen volume has dropped? Feeling like youre dribbling when you should be dousing can throw any guy for a loop. In fact, according to a recent Brazilian study, men who were unsatisfied with the amount of their ejaculate scored lower on measures of psychological and relationship health than guys who were unconcerned with it. Some men do identify with their sexual function and perceive their ejaculatory function as sort of a marker of their virility, or a mark of their manliness, Dr. Williams says. If they see that their sexual function has diminished, that can impact other domains of their lives. Getty So its not something you should stress about silently. If you notice a significant decrease in the volume of your ejaculation, its a good idea to make an appointment with a urologist so you can be evaluated for ejaculatory dysfunction, Dr. Williams says. This may include tests for some of the potential causes, such as low testosterone or diabetes. Your doc will also evaluate your medical and surgical history to see if any conditions or medications may be contributing to your low semen volume. Treating the causes of low semen volume So you've found the culprit behind your low semen volume. The next step is taking care of it, if possible.

12362,Monsanto Buys Whole Foods: Fact or Rumor?,"Since early 2011, there has been a lot of information circulating regarding Monsantos purported purchasing of the natural health food store known as Whole Foods; topics like Monsanto buys whole foods and others quickly became hot search terms. Interestingly enough, Monsanto was also rumored to have bought Blackwater (Xe), a private military company. While it is understandable that Monsanto would buy or at least work with Blackwater (as they are both in the same corrupt business), who would believe that Monsanto could scoop up Whole Foods? In actuality, the biotechnology giant did not buy Blackwater, and did not buy Whole Foods. Here are the details. Monsanto Buys Whole Foods? It all started in early 2011, when the USDA finally made the decision to deregulate genetically modified alfalfa without restrictions  a decision which caused many individuals, companies, and farmers to become very upset. Before the decision was made, the USDA was considering two options which they would present to the industry: to fully deregulate the alfalfa or to deregulate it with restrictions. Unfortunately, there was no option presented to the industry by the USDA for an outright ban on GM alfalfa, so Whole Foods went with the better option available. Whole Foods Market advocated strongly for deregulation with restrictions to preserve the ability of non-GE and organic growers to avoid contamination. It seemed that the USDA was finally recognizing that cross-contamination of GE alfalfa could potentially impact organic and non-GE farmers and consumers, both domestically and for our export marketsUnfortunately, the USDAs decision fell far short of this mark, and we believe that unrestricted planting of GE alfalfa without setting any clear coexistence framework, with thresholds for contamination and providing for ongoing testing and verification, is irresponsible, states a post on the Whole Foods website. Many people have asked us why we endorsed the coexistence option rather than an outright ban on GE alfalfa. That was never an option in Washington!..the option of an outright ban was not on the table, the post on the Whole Foods website said. Whole Foods Market  along with the National Cooperative Grocers Association, the National Organic Coalition, the Organic Trade Association, and other companies and groups  endorsed the path of deregulation with restrictions, or coexistence, not because it was a perfect path, but because it was a path to create meaningful change right now in the regulating of genetically engineered foods and the protection of non-GE foods.  Since Whole Foods supported the USDAs approach of coexistence, some consumer groups said the company started supporting GM foods, but along with the Monsanto buys Whole Foods rumors, this also wasnt true. The Organic Consumer Associations (OCA) released a rather misleading article titled Whole Foods Caves to Monsanto in 2011, which was the start of Monsanto buys Whole Foods rumors. No! What crazy talk! Weve never had any affiliation with that company. We are publicly traded; our majority shareholders are listed in documents filed with the SEC and, I promise, Monsanto is not on the list and never has beenYou see, Whole Foods Market and others in the organic food industry met with the US Secretary of Agriculture in support of farmers rights to grow Non-GMO crops. Because we did not take the exact hard-line stance that the OCA did, they accused us of being in bed with Monsanto' said a Whole Foods employee.

Young of Young, vanAssenderp, Varnadoe & Anderson, P.A., Tallahassee, for Amicus Curiae The Florida Chamber of Commerce. Robert Corn-Revere and Brad C. Deutsch of Hogan & Hartson, LLP, Washington, DC, for Amicus Curiae Belo Corp., Cox Television, Inc., Gannett Co., Inc., Media General Operations, Inc., and Post-Newsweek Stations, Inc. New World Communications of Tampa, Inc., d/b/a WTVT-TV, a subsidiary of Fox Television, challenges a judgment entered against it for violating Florida's private sector whistle-blower's statute, section 448.102, Florida Statutes (Supp.1998). We reverse. In December 1996, WTVT hired the appellee, Jane Akre, and her husband, Steve Wilson, as a husband-and-wife investigative reporting team. Shortly after Akre and Wilson arrived at WTVT, they began working on a story about the use of synthetic bovine growth hormone (BGH) in Florida dairy cattle. Their work on this story led to what could be characterized as an eight-month tug-of-war between the reporters and WTVT's management and lawyers over the content of the story. Each time the station asked Wilson and Akre to provide supporting documentation for statements in the story or to make changes in the content of the story, the reporters accused the station of attempting to distort the story to favor the manufacturer of BGH. In September 1997, WTVT notified Akre and Wilson that it was exercising its option to terminate their employment contracts without cause. Akre and Wilson responded in writing to WTVT threatening to file a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) alleging that the station had illegally edited the still unfinished BGH report in violation of an FCC policy against federally licensed broadcasters deliberately distorting the news. The parties never resolved their differences regarding the content of the story, and consequently, the story never aired. In April 1998, Akre and Wilson sued WTVT alleging, among other things, claims under the whistle-blower's statute. Those claims alleged that their terminations had been in retaliation for their resisting WTVT's attempts to distort or suppress the BGH story and for threatening to report the alleged news distortion to the FCC. Akre also brought claims for declaratory relief and for breach of contract. After a four-week trial, a jury found against Wilson on all of his claims. The trial court directed a verdict against Akre on her breach of contract claim, Akre abandoned her claim for declaratory relief, and the trial court let her whistle-blower claims go to the jury. The jury rejected all of Akre's claims except her claim that WTVT retaliated against her in response to her threat to disclose the alleged news distortion to the FCC. The jury awarded Akre $425,000 in damages. While WTVT has raised a number of challenges to the judgment obtained by Akre, we need not address each challenge because we find as a threshold matter that Akre failed to state a claim under the whistle-blower's statute. The portion of the whistle-blower's statute pertinent to this appeal prohibits retaliation against employees who have [d]isclosed, or threatened to disclose, employer conduct that is in violation of a law, rule, or regulation.  448.102(1)(3). The statute defines a law, rule or regulation as includ[ing] any statute or  any rule or regulation adopted pursuant to any federal, state, or local statute or ordinance applicable to the employer and pertaining to the business.  448.101(4), Fla. Stat. (1997). We agree with WTVT that the FCC's policy against the intentional falsification of the news-which the FCC has called its news distortion policy-does not qualify as the required law, rule, or regulation under section 448.102. The FCC has never published its news distortion policy as a regulation with definitive elements and defenses. Instead, the FCC has developed the policy through the adjudicatory process in decisions resolving challenges to broadcasters' licenses. The policy's roots can be traced to 1949 when the FCC first expressed its concern regarding deceptive news in very general terms stating that [a] licensee would be abusing his position as a public trustee of these important means of mass communications were he to withhold from expression over his facilities relevant news of facts concerning a controversy or to slant or distort the news. See Chad Raphael, The FCC's Broadcast News Distortion Rules: Regulation by Drooping Eyelid, 6 Comm. L. & Policy 485, 494 (2001) (quoting Editorializing by Broadcast Licensees, 13 F.C.C. 1246, 1246 (1949)). The policy did not begin to take shape, however, until 1969 when the FCC was called upon to investigate complaints regarding news distortion. Raphael at 494. Notably, the FCC did not take the initiative to investigate these complaints, but rather acted only after Congress referred complaints it had received to the FCC. In a series of opinions issued in licensing proceedings between 1969 and 1973, the FCC stated that when considering the status of a broadcaster's license, it would take into consideration proven instances of deliberate news distortion, also called intentional falsification of the news or rigging or slanting the news. In re CBS Program Hunger in America, 20 F.C.C.2d 143, 150-51 (1969). This series of FCC opinions has come to be known as the FCC's news distortion policy. Akre argues that the FCC's policy is a rule as defined by section 120.52(15), Florida Statutes (1997), which provides: Rule means each agency statement of general applicability that implements, interprets, or prescribes law or policy or describes the procedure or practice requirements of an agency and includes any form which imposes any requirement or solicits any information not specifically required by statute or by an existing rule. Even if we agreed with Akre that the FCC's news distortion policy was a rule as defined by section 120.52(15), her argument overlooks the fact that the whistle-blower's statute specifically limits the definition of rule to an adopted rule.  448.101(4). This limitation to adopted material only appears deliberate, and well serves the public by hinging civil liability upon matters of which due notice, actual or imputed, has been conveyed. Forrester v. John B. Phipps, Inc., 643 So.2d 1109 (Fla. 1st DCA 1994). We find the legislature's use of the word adopted in the statute to be a limitation on the scope of conduct that will subject an employer to liability under the statute. It is undisputed that the FCC's news distortion policy has never been adopted as defined by section 120.54, Florida Statutes (1997). In that regard, Akre notes that federal agencies may announce general policies and interpretive principles through the adjudicative process and argues that the fact that the FCC adopted the news distortion policy through an adjudicative process does not affect its validity or enforceability as a matter of federal law. This argument is flawed in two respects. First, federal law recognizes a dichotomy between rulemaking and adjudication; it does not equate the two. See Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 109 S.Ct. 468, 102 L.Ed.2d 493 (1988) (Scalia, J., concurring). Second, while federal agencies may have discretion to formulate policy through the adjudicative process, the same is not true under Florida law. The Florida Legislature has limited state agencies' discretion to formulate policy through the adjudicative process by requiring agencies to formally adopt each agency statement that fits the definition of a rule under section 120.52. See  120.54. As noted above, the legislature's use of the word adopted in the whistle-blower's statute was deliberate and was intended to limit the scope of conduct that will subject an employer to liability. This limitation is consistent with the legislature's requirement that agency statements that fit the definition of a rule be formally adopted. Recognizing an uncodified agency policy developed through the adjudicative process as the equivalent of a formally adopted rule is not consistent with this policy, and it would expand the scope of conduct that could subject an employer to liability beyond what Florida's Legislature could have contemplated when it enacted the whistle-blower's statute. Because the FCC's news distortion policy is not a law, rule, or regulation under section 448.102, Akre has failed to state a claim under the whistle-blower's statute. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment in her favor and remand for entry of a judgment in favor of WTVT. Reversed and remanded. ORDER ON APPELLEE'S MOTION FOR REHEARING, MOTION FOR CLARIFICATION, MOTION FOR REHEARING EN BANC, AND MOTION FOR CERTIFICATION OF QUESTION OF GREAT PUBLIC IMPORTANCE. This court entered an order granting appellate attorney's fees to the appellant, New World Communications of Tampa, Inc., d/b/a WTVT-TV, a subsidiary of Fox Television. Thereafter, the appellee, Jane Akre, sought rehearing, clarification, rehearing en banc, and certification of a question of great public importance. We grant Akre's requests for rehearing and clarification and deny her requests for rehearing en banc and certification. WTVT appealed a final judgment entered against it for violating Florida's private sector whistle-blower's statute, section 448.102, Florida Statutes (1997). The final judgment was entered pursuant to a jury verdict awarding Akre $425,000 in damages. We reversed after concluding that Akre had failed to state a claim under the whistle-blower's statute. We also granted WTVT's motion for appellate attorney's fees under section 448.104, Florida Statutes (1997), which states, [a] court may award reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and expenses to the prevailing party. In her motion for rehearing, Akre argues that because section 448.104 authorizes an award of attorney's fees to prevailing defendants as well as to prevailing plaintiffs, this court should apply the standard articulated in Christiansburg Garment Co. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 434 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978). In Christiansburg, the Court had to determine the proper standard for an award of attorney's fees to a prevailing defendant in an action brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII gives courts discretion to award fees to the prevailing party, as does section 448.104, but it does not give any indication of when a court should award fees to a prevailing plaintiff or a prevailing defendant. The Christiansburg Court concluded that equitable considerations embodied in Title VII justified applying different standards depending on whether the prevailing party was a plaintiff or a defendant. The Court found that while fees should be awarded to every prevailing plaintiff unless special circumstances would make such an award unjust, fees should only be awarded to a prevailing defendant when the plaintiff's action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation. Christiansburg, 434 U.S. at 420. We do not agree with Akre's contention that this same standard should apply to an action brought under Florida's whistle-blower's statute. We are not persuaded that the reasons cited by the Christiansburg Court for applying different standards to prevailing plaintiffs and defendants apply to cases brought under section 448.103. To the extent that this question has been addressed by other courts, they have likewise concluded that the Christiansburg standard is not applicable to fee awards under section 448.104. See Gamb v. Hilton Hotels Corp., No. 95-466-CIV-ORL-19, 1997 WL 893874 (M.D.Fla. Sept.26, 1997), aff'd, 132 F.3d 46 (11th Cir.1997); McGregor v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 130 F.R.D. 464 (S.D.Fla.1990), aff'd, 956 F.2d 1017 (11th Cir.1992). Nevertheless, because section 448.104 is not mandatory, we must consider whether to exercise our discretion and make such an award in this case. Under the circumstances of this appeal, we conclude that WTVT is not entitled to appellate attorney's fees. Akre came to this court as an appellee defending a final judgment entered in her favor at the conclusion of a jury trial. We do not believe that it is either realistic or good policy to require an appellee who has obtained a favorable jury verdict to abandon it on appeal or risk an award of attorney's fees if it is reversed. We reach this conclusion even though the whistle-blower aspect of Akre's case was without legal merit from its inception. This court has held that because all final judgments have a presumption of correctness, attempting to uphold one is not frivolous. Cf. Dep't of Highway Safety & Motor Vehicles v. Salter, 710 So.2d 1039 (Fla. 2d DCA 1998). Accordingly, even the lack of legal merit in Akre's position does not convince us that we should exercise our discretion to award appellate attorney's fees to WTVT. We emphasize that we are only considering the issue of a proper exercise of discretion for an award of appellate attorney's fees. On remand, the trial court will have to make its own determination regarding whether to award trial court attorney's fees to WTVT as the prevailing party. To be entitled to such an award, however, WTVT does not have to demonstrate that Akre's suit was frivolous. No further motions for rehearing will be entertained. FOOTNOTES . We are aware of the Fourth District's decision in Forum v. Boca Burger, Inc., 788 So.2d 1055 (Fla. 4th DCA 2001), review granted, 817 So.2d 844 (Fla.2002). We have concluded that it is not pertinent to our decision because Salter still represents this district's position regarding whether defense of a judgment on appeal can ever be considered frivolous. Additionally, we find nothing in Forum that expressly repudiates that principle, which was the law in the Fourth District when Forum was decided. See Coral Springs Roofing Co. v. Campagna, 528 So.2d 557 (Fla. 4th DCA 1988). Rather, the holding in Forum is directed to the proper construction of a 1999 amendment to section 57.105, Florida Statutes, that the Fourth District concluded broadened the circumstances under which a fee award could be made under that statute.

13837,Hebrew numerals,"The system of Hebrew numerals is a quasi-decimal alphabetic numeral system using the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The system was adapted from that of the Greek numerals in the late 2nd century BC. The current numeral system is also known as the Hebrew alphabetic numerals to contrast with earlier systems of writing numerals used in classical antiquity. These systems were inherited from usage in the Aramaic and Phoenician scripts, attested from c. 800 BC in the so-called Samaria ostraca and sometimes known as Hebrew-Aramaic numerals, ultimately derived from the Egyptian Hieratic numerals. The Greek system was adopted in Hellenistic Judaism and had been in use in Greece since about the 5th century BC. [1] In this system, there is no notation for zero, and the numeric values for individual letters are added together. Each unit (1, 2, ..., 9) is assigned a separate letter, each tens (10, 20, ..., 90) a separate letter, and the first four hundreds (100, 200, 300, 400) a separate letter. The later hundreds (500, 600, 700, 800 and 900) are represented by the sum of two or three letters representing the first four hundreds. To represent numbers from 1,000 to 999,999, the same letters are reused to serve as thousands, tens of thousands, and hundreds of thousands. Gematria (Jewish numerology) uses these transformations extensively. In Israel today, the decimal system of Arabic numerals (ex. 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.) is used in almost all cases (money, age, date on the civil calendar). The Hebrew numerals are used only in special cases, such as when using the Hebrew calendar, or numbering a list (similar to a, b, c, d, etc.), much as Roman numerals are used in the West. Numbers [ edit ] The Hebrew language has names for common numbers that range from zero to one million. Letters of the Hebrew alphabet are used to represent numbers in a few traditional contexts, for example in calendars. In other situations Arabic numerals are used. Cardinal and ordinal numbers must agree in gender with the noun they are describing. If there is no such noun (e.g. telephone numbers), the feminine form is used. For ordinal numbers greater than ten the cardinal is used and numbers above the value 20 have no gender. Early 20th century pocket watches with Hebrew numerals in clockwise order ( Jewish Museum, Berlin ). Ordinal values [ edit ] Ordinal (English) Ordinal (Hebrew) Masculine Feminine First (rishon)  (rishona)  Second (sheni)  (shniya)  Third (shlishi)  (shlishit)  Fourth (revi'i)  (revi'it)  Fifth (chamishi)  (chamishit)  Sixth (shishi)  (shishit)  Seventh (shvi'i)  (shvi'it)  Eighth (shmini)  (shminit)  Ninth (tshi'i)  (tshi'it)  Tenth ('asiri)  ('asirit)  Note: For ordinal numbers greater than 10, cardinal numbers are used instead. Cardinal Values [ edit ] Note: For numbers greater than 20, gender does not apply. Officially, numbers greater than million were represented by the long scale; However, since January 21st, 2013, the modified short scale (under which the long scale milliard is substituted for the strict short scale billion), which was already the colloquial standard, became official.[2] Speaking and writing [ edit ] Cardinal and ordinal numbers must agree in gender (masculine or feminine; mixed groups are treated as masculine) with the noun they are describing. If there is no such noun (e.g. a telephone number or a house number in a street address), the feminine form is used. Ordinal numbers must also agree in number and definite status like other adjectives. The cardinal number precedes the noun (e.g., shlosha yeladim), except for the number one which succeeds it (e.g., yeled echad). The number two is special: shnayim (m.) and shtayim (f.) become shney (m.) and shtey (f.) when followed by the noun they count. For ordinal numbers (numbers indicating position) greater than ten the cardinal is used. Calculations [ edit ] The Hebrew numeric system operates on the additive principle in which the numeric values of the letters are added together to form the total. For example, 177 is represented as  which (from right to left) corresponds to 100 + 70 + 7 = 177. Mathematically, this type of system requires 27 letters (1-9, 10-90, 100-900). In practice the last letter, tav (which has the value 400) is used in combination with itself and/or other letters from kof (100) onwards, to generate numbers from 500 and above. Alternatively, the 22-letter Hebrew numeral set is sometimes extended to 27 by using 5 sofit (final) forms of the Hebrew letters.[3] Key exceptions [ edit ] By convention, the numbers 15 and 16 are represented as  (9 + 6) and  (9 + 7), respectively, in order to refrain from using the two-letter combinations - (10 + 5) and - (10 + 6), which are alternate written forms for the Name of God in everyday writing. In the calendar, this manifests every full moon, since all Hebrew months start on a new moon (see for example: Tu BiShvat). Combinations which would spell out words with negative connotations are sometimes avoided by switching the order of the letters. For instance, 744 which should be written as  (meaning ""you/it will be destroyed"") might instead be written as  or  (meaning ""end to demon""). Use of final letters [ edit ] The Hebrew numeral system has sometimes been extended to include the five final letter forms (500),  (600),  (700),  (800),  (900)which are then used to indicate the numbers from 500 to 900. The ordinary forms for 500 to 900 are (500),  (600),  (700),  (800),  (900) Gershayim [ edit ]            Passed away on day 20 Iyar And buried on day 23 Iyar Year 695 without the thousands [i.e. year 5695] Note the dots above each letter in each number. A tombstone from 1935 in Baiersdorf Germany , reading:In English:Note the dots above each letter in each number. Gershayim (U+05F4 in Unicode, and resembling a double quote mark) (sometimes erroneously referred to as merkha'ot, which is Hebrew for double quote) are inserted before (to the right of) the last (leftmost) letter to indicate that the sequence of letters represents a number rather than a word. This is used in the case where a number is represented by two or more Hebrew numerals (e.g., 28  ). Similarly, a single Geresh (U+05F3 in Unicode, and resembling a single quote mark) is appended after (to the left of) a single letter to indicate that the letter represents a number rather than a (one-letter) word. This is used in the case where a number is represented by a single Hebrew numeral (e.g., 100  ). Note that Geresh and Gershayim merely indicate ""not a (normal) word."" Context usually determines whether they indicate a number or something else (such as ""abbreviation""). An alternative method found in old manuscripts and still found on modern-day tombstones is to put a dot above each letter of the number. Decimals [ edit ] In print, Arabic numerals are employed in Modern Hebrew for most purposes. Hebrew numerals are used nowadays primarily for writing the days and years of the Hebrew calendar; for references to traditional Jewish texts (particularly for Biblical chapter and verse and for Talmudic folios); for bulleted or numbered lists (similar to A, B, C, etc., in English); and in numerology (gematria). Thousands are counted separately, and the thousands count precedes the rest of the number (to the right, since Hebrew is read from right to left). There are no special marks to signify that the count is starting over with thousands, which can theoretically lead to ambiguity, although a single quote mark is sometimes used after the letter. When specifying years of the Hebrew calendar in the present millennium, writers usually omit the thousands (which is presently 5 []), but if they do not this is accepted to mean 5 * 1000, with no ambiguity. The current Israeli coinage includes the thousands.[clarification needed] Monday, 15 Adar 5764 (where 5764 = 5(1000) + 400 + 300 + 60 + 4, and 15 = 9 + 6): In full (with thousands): Monday, 15(th) of Adar, 5764      Common usage (omitting thousands): Monday, 15(th) of Adar, (5)764      Thursday, 3 Nisan 5767 (where 5767 = 5(1000) + 400 + 300 + 60 + 7): In full (with thousands): Thursday, 3(rd) of Nisan, 5767      Common usage (omitting thousands): Thursday, 3(rd) of Nisan, (5)767      To see how today's date in the Hebrew calendar is written, see, for example, Hebcal date converter.

86,Ohio Has the Highest Payday Loan Prices in the Nation,"Nationwide, Americans in all demographic groups use payday loans. The only requirements to obtain such credit are a checking account and a source of income. Typical borrowers earn about $30,000 per year, and most use the loans to cover recurring expenses such as rent, mortgage payments, groceries, and utilities.1 Payday loans in Ohio are the countrys most expensive, with a typical annual percentage rate (APR) of 591 percent.2 Lenders charge higher prices in Ohio than in any neighboring state. Distressing signals 1 in 10 adults in Ohioroughly 1 million peoplehas taken out a payday loan. 3 No payday or auto title lenders are licensed under the Short-Term Loan Act, which passed the Ohio Legislature with bipartisan support in 2008 and was an attempt to curb payday loan rates. The industry then tried to get Ohio voters to repeal the legislative action. When that effort failed, lenders circumvented the law by obtaining licenses to operate as credit service organizations, which are not subject to fee limits. 4 Ohios market consists of more than 650 payday loan storefronts in 76 counties, more than 90 percent of which are owned and operated by companies that also do business in other states. 5 Payday loans in Ohio have unnecessarily high prices: Borrowers are charged up to four times what their peers pay in other states.6 (See Table 1.) Ohio can balance affordability and access to credit In 2010, Colorado lawmakers replaced conventional two-week payday loans with six-month installment payday loans at lower prices. Each year, borrowers in that state save more than $40 million, which goes back into the states economy. 7 After reform, access to credit remains widely available in Colorado. 8 An average loan payment consumes 4 percent of a borrowers next paycheck. 9 Borrowers have a pathway out of debt, and 75 percent of loans are repaid early. 10 With similarly sensible reforms, Ohio policymakers can reduce costs for their constituents, creating affordability for borrowers and a viable market for lenders. Federal rules are not enough to protect Ohioans Nationally, borrowers overwhelmingly want reform, with 8 in 10 favoring requirements that payments take up only a small amount of a borrowers paycheck with more time to repay the loan. 11 The federal agency that sets rules for these loans, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has proposed a requirement that lenders review borrowers credit reports and evaluate their debt obligations before making loans. 12 Under this requirement, however, the 400 and 500 percent APR payday and auto title loans that are on the market today would still be allowed in Ohio. Further, Ohios market has begun shifting to longer-term payday installment loans with similarly high APRs and unaffordable payments. 13 The Ohio General Assembly has the power to license and set reasonable terms for these loans; the federal agency does not.

During the meeting, shareholder Tom Strobhar (who founded the Corporate Morality Action Center) pointed out that after the company voiced its support for a referendum backing gay marriage in Washington state, a boycott by traditional marriage supporters caused a drop in sales revenue. Schultz told him You can sell your shares in Starbucks and buy shares in another company if he did not agree with the companys pro-gay marriage stand. Despite strong opposition from the religious and political right, support for gay marriage in America has risen in recent years. The rise of support for gay marriage has also seen a rise of intolerance for those who oppose it. Many who joined the boycott of Starbucks last yearwere dismissed as bigots, even though the boycott did cause revenue to drop. A website,DumpStarbucks.com, has earned tens of thousands of supporters who refuse to buy from the coffee chain in response.

18,Attention children of the 90s: you can still get McDonalds pizza,"Remember the crunch of the cornmeal crust? And the stringy cheese, with a slightly sweeter-than normal marinara underneath? Maybe you shoved french fries in it like birthday candles. Or ate it crust first, as was the style at the time. In any case, if youre a child of the nineties, you remember it well: McDonalds pizza. And, like pogs and Beanie Babies, it too disappeared with the innocence of your childhood. Except, in two magical locations in Ohio and West Virginia, where one hero owner has kept the McDonalds pizza ovens burning all these years later. So bust out a gel pen to jot down these directions, because Im about to tell you where you can still buy McDonalds pizza. Neslted on the banks of the Ohio River, along the border with West Virginia sits the village of Pomeroy, population 1,852 in the 2010 census. And its McDonalds, located along Main Street on the riverbank, still pumps out pizza in five minutes or less, of course. Its just a seven-and-a-half hour drive from Toronto in zero traffic, according to Google Maps. And, thanks to owner Greg Mills, theres another McDs where you can still get a slice, just over ninety kilometres away, across the state border. Spencer, West Virginia also boasts a McDonalds thats still lighting the pizza fires or electrical coils, as the case may be. According to employee Judy Norman, its the same pizza as they sold when she started there 11 years ago and its presumably the same that children everywhere enjoyed throughout the 1990s. She said the location sold 13 pizzas yesterday, but there are days when everyone wants pizza and there are days where just every so often you get a pizza [order]. Mills, who its pretty safe to call an American hero for preserving this very unique pizza, couldnt not be immediately reached for comment, but this post will be updated should he return our calls. Whatever actually happened to McDonalds pizza, you ask? Well, for starters, it turned out adult palates didnt quite take to it the same way kids did. When McDonalds first launched its pizza in the Canadian market in the early 90s, it was tapping into a growing appetite for pizza as burger sales dwindled. It even launched hockey-themed TV ads. The market for the savoury pie topped $2 billion in the early 90s, according to a 2004 National Post article on the death of McDonalds pizza. And the company poured $25 million into the ovens alone across Canada, to moderate success throughout the decade. Then the-drive through took over remember waiting for your pizza to be delivered with a plastic number on top of your car? and pizza slowed things down as its own sales were dragging. So the ovens were scrapped and McDonalds turned its sights on other gimmicky productions like the Arch Deluxe, which I think we can blame for Jessica Biel becoming a thing. The saddest clarification of all time: As first reported by Metro Montreal and translated by Emergent, it appears theres some confusion as to whether the pizza being sold at these two locations is the McPizza we all remember. Unfortunately, McDonalds headquarters says its not the exact recipe, but its also reviewed online as being very close. So, the only way to sure is a road trip followed by a taste test.

McDonalds has just announced that it will be phasing out 8 menu items the beginning of next year and most McDonalds customers are not happy. With McDonalds profits tanking over the recent months, the company has had to make some tough decisions to find adequate solutions for their financial distress by shrinking menu sizes. Our intent is to have a cleaner menu board that is easier for customers to absorb, spokeswoman Lisa McComb said in a statement. To do so we must simplify our current menu. This means the end of the Big Mac, apple pie and large size menu items. Currently, the Big Mac has a whopping 550 calories and 29g of fat. The Apple pie contains 250 cal, and it would take a full 69 minute to walk that off! With that being said, those two menu items were not a tough decision for elimination. McDonalds is currently testing out a new version of their slim down menu in Delaware, Little Rock, Waco, Bakersfield, Macon and Knoxville. They plan a full nationwide rollout beginning February 1, 2015. One notable ingredient preservatives might also be eliminated from the menu altogether. Mark Andrs, President of McDonalds USA, sparked widespread speculation when he asked investors, Why do we need to have preservatives in our food? And then answered himself with a We probably dont. What do you think about this new menu transformation at McDonalds? In an attempt to make America healthier, do you think it will work?

21,Reasons to Love New York 2014,"Editor's Note: In the most recent edition of New York, its annual Reasons to Love New York issue, the magazine published this story about a Stuyvesant High School senior named Mohammed Islam, who was rumored to have made $72 million trading stocks. Islam said his net worth was in the ""high eight figures."" As part of the research process, the magazine sent a fact-checker to Stuyvesant, where Islam produced a document that appeared to be a Chase bank statement attesting to an eight-figure bank account. After the story's publication, people questioned the $72 million figure in the headline, which was written by editors based on the rumored figure. The headline was amended. But in an interview with the New York Observer last night, Islam now says his entire story was made up. A source close to the Islam family told the Washington Post that the statements were falsified. We were duped. Our fact-checking process was obviously inadequate; we take full responsibility and we should have known better. New York apologizes to our readers. Rumors, on Wall Street, can be powerful. A whisper can turn into a current that moves markets, driving a stock price up or sending it tumbling. There may be only one other place where gossip holds such sway, and that is high school. Late last year, a rumor began circulating at Stuyvesant that a junior named Mohammed Islam had made a fortune in the stock market. Not a small fortune, either. Seventy-two million. An unbelievable amount of money for anyone, not least a high-school student, but as far as rumors go, this one seemed legit. Everyone at Stuy knew that Mohammed, the soft-spoken son of Bengali immigrants from Queens and the president of the schools Investment Club, was basically a genius. As the news spread, Mos stock went up. The school paper profiled him, Business Insider included him on a list of 20 Under 20, and Mo became a celebrity, as his friend Damir Tulemaganbetov put it on a recent Friday night at Mari Vanna near Union Square. A VIP! Mo, a cherubic senior with a goatee and slight faux-hawk, smiled shyly. Hes quiet today, said Patrick Trablusi, who was seated with Mo and Damir at a table littered with empty glasses. Humble. And tired: This is our third meeting of the day, Damir said, signaling to the waitress for another round. We saw a real-estate agent, a lawyer, you Next were going to see a hedge-fund guy, Patrick said. The friends locked eyes and started to giggle. He basically wants to give us $150 million, Mo explained, a blush like a sunset creeping over his cheeks. The waitress arrived with a tray of green drinks. Freshly squeezed apple juice, Damir said, passing them around. Its very good. Do you like caviar? After Mo became a celebrity, things got a little awkward at school. (Arent you the kid who made all that money? a teacher asked him.) So he reconnected with kids from his old school, Allen-Stevenson. One of them introduced him to Patrick, an aspiring financier, who introduced him to Damir at a poker game attended by kids whose parents are, according to Damir, the one percent of the one percent. The son of a Kazakh oligarch, Damir is tall, slim, and cocky, like a cigarette wearing a fedora. I call the poker game Destiny,'""he said. The waitress arrived with a plate. Here, have some caviar. Over late nights out and dinners at Morimoto, the three hatched a plan to start a hedge fund. There are a lot of steps we have to follow through, said Patrick, calling to mind a more serious Chuck Bass. But were on the right track. They plan to launch in June, after Mo turns 18 and can get his broker-dealer license. Mos our maestro, Patrick said. Hes going to be earning the big bucks. Were just going to try to fill his needs. All three plan to attend college next year, but theyre not concerned about classes getting in the way of their goal: A billion dollars! Damir said. By next year! Mo affirmed the number with a nod. But its not just about money, he added. We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence, like the Koch brothers Like in Wolf of Wall Street! Damir interjected. And Mo is Jordan Belfort. No, but, not like that, Patrick said, blanching slightly. Like Belfort, Mo started with penny stocks. A cousin showed him how to trade. He loved the feeling of riskthe way his hand shook making the tradebut he swore it off after losing a chunk of the money hed made tutoring. I didnt have the balls for it, he said. He was 9. It was a while before he was ready to try again. In the meantime, he became a scholar of modern finance, studying up on hedge-fund managers. He was particularly enamored of Paul Tudor Jones. I had been paralyzed by my loss, Mo said. But he was able to go back to it, even after losing thousands of dollars over and over. Paul Tudor Jones says, You learn more from your losses than from your gains. Mo got into trading oil and gold, and his bank account grew. Though he is shy about the $72 million number, he confirmed his net worth is in the high eight figures. More than enough to rent an apartment in Manhattanthough his parents wont let him live in it until he turns 18and acquire a BMW, which he cant drive because he doesnt yet have a license. Thus, it falls to his father to drive him past Tudor Joness Greenwich house for inspiration. Its because he is who he is that made me who I am today, Mo said. Which is to say: a believer in Wall Street. A lot of young people do start-ups, but I think its a bubble. Trading and investments will always be there. Money will always be rotating Money never sleeps! Damir added. Thats from the Wall Street movie. It all comes down to this, Mo continued. What makes the world go round? Money. If money is not flowing, if businesses dont keep going, theres no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs. The check arrived for the caviar and apple juice. It totaled $400. New York, thats where the moneys at, Damir shouted, pulling out a credit card. This reminded me of an old joke about robbing banks because thats where the money is. Damir grinned. My father has a quote, he said. Its really dope: You can rob a bank with a gun, but you can rob the whole world with a bank. Patrick buried his face in his hands. At the end of the day, he said, were young kids.",FALSE,http://nymag.com/news/articles/reasonstoloveny/2014/mohammed-islam-stock-trading/,Economy,Emergent
22,Here come the autonomous robot security guards: What could possibly go wrong?,"Showing a rather shocking disregard for the long-term safety of human civilization, Microsoft has become one of the first companies to deploy autonomous robot security guards. Dubbed the K5, Microsofts Silicon Valley campus was being policed last week by five of these roughly human-sized 300-pound (136 kg) robots, each equipped with enough cameras, sensors, artificial intelligence, and alarms that they can replace most human security patrols. Fortunately, despite looking like uncomfortably like a Dalek from the Doctor Who universe, the K5 is not (yet) equipped with a ray gun or any other method for harming or detaining humans. Updated: Microsoft contacted ExtremeTech to tell us that the robots were only temporarily deployed at its Silicon Valley campus, as part of a demonstration put on by Knightscope. Microsoft PR says it isnt aware of any future plans to deploy such robots. The K5, built by the Californian company Knightscope, is billed rather euphemistically as an autonomous data machine that provides a commanding but friendly physical presence. Basically, its a security guard on wheels. Inside that rather large casing (its 5 foot tall!) there are four high-def cameras facing in each direction, another camera that can do car license plate recognition, four microphones, gentle alarms, blaring sirens, weather sensors, and WiFi connectivity so that each robot can contact HQ if theres some kind of security breach/situation. For navigating the environment, theres GPS and laser scanning (LIDAR I guess). And of course, at the heart of each K5 is a computer running artificial intelligence software that integrates all of that data and tries to make intelligent inferences like, should I tell HQ about that large gathering of teenagers, or should that man be climbing in through that window? If a K5 decides that theres a situation, it can use one of its built-in sirens to try and diffuse things or it can message HQ to summon a human. If you step in front of the K5, or otherwise interfere with it, it will gently warn you with some chimes but if you dont move, an ear-piercing alarm is triggered. Other than its sirens and its rather imposing design, the K5 isnt equipped with any weapons or other tools for resolving situations. (Does anyone else think it looks like the lovechild of a Dalek and EVE from WALL-E?) K5 isnt just for catching criminals, either: If you find yourself in trouble/danger, theres also a button on the top of the robot that summons help from HQ. Read: Microsoft wants to be part of Judgment Day, too The purpose of the K5, like most robots, is straightforward: To replace expensive human workers. The K5 can run for around 24 hours on a single battery charge, automatically navigates back to the charging point when its running low, and only takes 15-20 minutes to recharge. Obviously, in the long run, this is cheaper and more efficient than a human security guard plus, as technology improves, the K5 will probably be more vigilant and capable of spotting smaller discrepancies than a human. In theory, because of the lower cost, you could also field lots of K5 robots, reducing the number of potential holes in security coverage. It goes without saying, though, that deploying a fleet of roughly human-sized, autonomous robots is just a little bit scary. At the very least, a 300-pound robot would cause a lot of damage if it ran into something a car, a shop window, a child. In all likelihood, though, if these robotic security guards are popular, theyll eventually be equipped with weapons perhaps a taser for subduing a suspect, and a tear gas launcher for clearing groups of people. At that point, you need to be really sure that the AI is free of bugs.

27,Jeff Bezos's New Plan for News: The Washington Post Becomes an Amazon Product,"SHARE THIS ARTICLE Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Jeff Bezos wants to turn the Washington Post into a national publication, and hes going to use his other companyAmazon.comto help achieve that goal. For the past few months, a group inside the Post has been working on a new application that will offer a curated selection of news and photographs from the daily newspaper in a magazine-style, tablet-friendly format. The application will come preinstalled on Amazons newly updated Kindle Fire tablet, expected to be launched later this fall with the larger 8.9-inch screen, according to people with knowledge of the Posts plans. The app will be free for owners of the larger Kindle, at least at first. It will eventually be available for download on other Kindles as well as to owners of Apples iPad and various Android devices, and it will carry a monthly subscription fee. A Post spokesperson declined to comment. Inside the Post, the effort has been dubbed Project Rainbow and is being led by Kerry Lauerman, the former editor-in-chief of Salon.com. Lauerman joined the paper as a senior editor in July to work on an initiative focused on the fast-growing mobile readership, according to a Post press release announcing the hire. Lauerman reports to Cory Haik, the Posts executive producer for digital news. One person with knowledge of Project Rainbow called it an experiment and part of a larger effort to find ways to expand the Posts reach. Its the first sign that Bezos will create ties between the newspaper and the e-commerce giant he started 20 years ago. Since Bezos bought the paper last year, media observers have wondered how he will resuscitate a franchise with plenty of old-media challenges, such as declining print advertising and a readership that increasingly gets its news online and from mobile devices. The paper introduced a novel program that allows smaller publications to give their paying readers online access to the Posts website. In September, meanwhile, Bezos dismissed the Posts longtime publisher, Katharine Weymouth, and replaced her with Frederick J. Ryan Jr., a former aide to President Ronald Reagan. Bezos has also accelerated hiring at the newspaper, bringing in 100 new journalists while cutting pensions and other retirement benefits for current employees. The resulting buzz has been positive, on balance. David Carr, media columnist at the New York Times, just heralded a recent turnaround in quality: The once-embattled newspaper, he wrote, is in the middle of a great run, turning out the kind of reporting that journalistsand readerslive for. Amazons Kindle Fire tablets and its new Fire Phone lag in popularity behind competing tablets and phones from Apple, Samsung Electronics, and others. But Amazon has placed a unique bet that editorially produced content, such as Amazon-published books, Amazon-produced TV shows, and now perhaps Washington Post-published news, can attract additional users.",TRUE,http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-06/jeff-bezos-plan-for-news-washington-post-becomes-an-amazon-product,Economy,Emergent
30,Comcast Declares War on Tor?,"If you needed another reason to hate Comcast, the most hated company in America, theyve just given it to you: theyve declared war on Tor Browser. >>Hide Your Tor Usage From your ISP Click here For Our Best VPNs Chart!<<< Reports have surfaced (The first one was via /r/darknetmarkets and another one submitted to us) that Comcast agents have contacted customers using Tor and instructed them to stop using the browser or risk termination of service. A Comcast agent named Jeremy allegedly called Tor an illegal service. The Comcast agent told its customer that such activity is against usage policies. The Comcast agent then repeatedly asked the customer to tell him what sites he was accessing on the Tor browser. The customer refused to answer. The next day the customer called Comcast and spoke to another agent named Kelly who reiterated that Comcast does not want its customers using Tor. The Comcast agent then allegedly told the customer: Users who try to use anonymity, or cover themselves up on the internet, are usually doing things that arent so-to-speak legal. We have the right to terminate, fine, or suspend your account at anytime due to you violating the rules. Do you have any other questions? Thank you for contacting Comcast, have a great day. How did Comcast know its customers were using Tor in the first place? Because Tor Browser provides online anonymity to its users, This would mean that Comcast is monitoring the online activities of its users, to (among other things) check if they are following their Acceptable Use Policy. Comcast has previously been listed by the Tor project as a Bad ISP. The users of the Tor project listed Comcast as a bad ISP that is not friendly to Tor. The Tor project cited Comcasts Acceptable Use Policy for its residential customers which claims to not allow servers or proxies under technical restrictions.: use or run dedicated, stand-alone equipment or servers from the Premises that provide network content or any other services to anyone outside of your Premises local area network (PremisesLAN), also commonly referred to as public services or servers. Examples of prohibited equipment and servers include, but are not limited to, email, web hosting, file sharing, and proxy services and servers; A Comcast spokesperson told DeepDotWeb that: We respect customer privacy and security and would only investigate the specifics of a customers account with a valid court order. And if were asked by a court to provide customer information, then we ask for a reasonable amount of time to notify the customer so they can decide if they would like to hire a lawyer and if they do, then we turn the case over to them and they proceed with the judge directly and we step away. However, this statement appears to be at odds with Comcasts treatment of Ross Ulbricht, alleged Dread Pirate Roberts. Comcast previously corroborated with the FBI by providing information on alleged Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbrichts internet usage. Ulbrichts legal defense without a warrant. Ulbricht was most certainly never given a warning by Comcast or given time to contact a lawyer before he was arrested in a San Francisco library last October. Comcast already monitors its customers internet usage to prevent them from downloading pirated media in violation of copyright laws. Under the Six Strikes plan, Comcast customers who are caught by Comcast pirating copy-written material are emailed by Comcast and told to cease the activity. Comcast will continue monitoring them, and if they violate the Six Strikes plan five more times, their internet service will be terminated. EDIT 14.9.14: Removed a sentence that was wrong.

34,Apples next major Mac revealed: the radically new 12-inch MacBook Air,"Apple is preparing an all-new MacBook Air for 2015 with a radically new design that jettisons standards such as full-sized USB ports, MagSafe connectors, and SD card slots in favor of a markedly thinner and lighter body with a higher-resolution display. Sources within Apple, who have used internal prototype versions of the upcoming computer, have provided in-depth details about the machine, and our exclusive artist renditions of the revamped MacBook Air provide the first close look at Apples first major step in mobile Mac computing since the Retina MacBook Pro launch in 2012. iPad Air 2 The 12-inch MacBook Air will be considerably smaller than the current 13-inch version, yet also slightly narrower than the 11-inch model. The new 12-inch version is approximately a quarter-of-an-inch narrower than the 11-inch version, yet it is also a quarter-of-an-inch taller in order to accommodate the slightly larger display. In order to fit the larger screen into a footprint about the size of the current 11-inch model, the bezels on the display have been reduced on all sides. Besides a new look for the front of the computer, the entire unibody has been revamped from the keyboard to the trackpad to the speakers. Taking cues from the 12-inch PowerBook introduced by Steve Jobs over a decade ago, the new keyboard sits edge-to-edge across the width of the laptop. In addition to going edge-to-edge, the entire key set has been subtly redesigned so that each key sits noticeably closer together. Apple has squeezed the keys closer in order for the computer to be as narrow as possible, which can be seen in the rendition below: Apple has also relocated some of the function keys across the top and simplified the arrow key array in order to keep the keyboard as narrow as possible without taking away from overall usability. In addition to the keyboard, the trackpad has been changed. The trackpad is approximately the same width as that on the 11-inch MacBook Air (if not ever-so-slightly wider), but it is apparently slightly taller, nearly touching the bottoms of the keyboard and the frame. In line with earlier rumors, it also appears that the new trackpad does not have the same clicking effect as found on current and earlier MacBook models. The elimination of physical feedback in the click is part of Apples plan to reduce the thickness of the MacBook to a bare minimum. As can be seen in 9to5Mac artist Michael Steebers rendition above, the new 12-inch Air (on the left) is far thinner than the current 11-inch model (on the right). Taking cues from the current Air, the future model has a teardrop-like, tapered design that gets thinner from top to bottom. Above the keyboard are four redesigned speaker grills that actually double as ventilation holes for the fan-less device to keep cool. The upcoming laptop is so thin that Apple employees are said to refer to the device as the MacBook Stealth internally. In order to reach that new level of portability, Apple not only slimmed down the trackpad and tweaked the speakers but the ports as well: The upcoming 12-inch Air has the fewest amount of ports ever on an Apple computer, as can be seen in the rendition above. On the right side is a standard headphone jack and dual-microphones for input and noise-canceling. On the left side is solely the new USB Type-C port. Yes, Apple is currently planning to ditch standard USB ports, the SD Card slot, and even its Thunderbolt and MagSafe charging standards on this new notebook. We must note that Apple tests several designs of upcoming products, so Apple may choose to ultimately release a new Air that does include the legacy components, though there is very little space on the edges for them. As weve reported on multiple occasions, the new USB Type-C connector is smaller, faster, and more capable than the standard USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports on existing computers. The connector is able to replace the Thunderbolt Display port on the current Apple laptops as USB Type-C actually has the technology to drive displays. Additionally, the latest specifications from the USB foundation indicate that USB Type-C can actually be used to power computers, which makes the standard MagSafe plugs unnecessary on this new device. The connector is also reversible like Lightning on iPads and iPhones, which should make the overall experience a bit more intuitive. As the new MacBook may only have a single port, it would make sense for Apple to create a hub of some sort for users to be able to plug in multiple devices into the new laptop. Apple already ships all sorts of adapters for its Macs and iOS Devices, so adding yet another attachment to the accessory portfolio would not be unprecedented. With Apple moving to a new Space Gray color on its iOS devices and on some Macs (such as with the 2013 Mac Pro), it seems possible that this new MacBook may come in a new gray color, as shown off in some of our renditions. The latest rumors indicate that the new MacBook Air will ship in mid-2015 (perhaps around WWDC), while other reports have claimed that the new Air is already nearing production. With Intel revealing the latest news on the Broadwell chipset family at CES this week, the ball is likely now in Apples court for pushing the future of mobile computing into the world.",TRUE,http://9to5mac.com/2015/01/06/macbook-air-12-inch-redesign/,Economy,Emergent

The company, based in Seattle, also raised its annual prime membership fee to $139 per year from $119. This is the first time Amazon has raised the price of Prime membership since 2018.

The company reported a profit of $14.32 billion, or $27.75 per share, for the three-month period ended Dec. 31, 2021. That compared with a profit of $7.22 billion, or $14.09 per share, a share, during the year-ago period. Revenue rose 9% to $137.41 billion, the company���s fifth consecutive quarter of revenue topping $100 billion.

Analysts surveyed by FactSet, however, on average expected $137.68 billion in quarterly revenue and per-share earnings of $3.61 per share.

The company said that sales are expected to be between $112 billion and $117 billion for the current fiscal quarter. Analysts were expecting $120.93 billion, according to FactSet estimates.

Amazon was one of the few retailers that has prospered during the COVID-19 outbreak: As physical stores selling non-essential goods temporarily or permanently closed, homebound people turned to Amazon for everything from groceries to cleaning supplies.

There���s ���continued concern that Facebook���s past challenges will follow Meta into the metaverse,��� said Mike Proulx, research director at Forrester Research. ���The company has work to do to convince consumers that Meta���s expression of the metaverse is a good thing,���

Since Meta took on its new name last fall, the company has been shifting resources and hiring engineers ��� including from competitors like Apple and Google ��� who can help Zuckerberg realize his vision.

Think of the metaverse as the internet brought to life, or at least rendered in 3D. Zuckerberg has described it as a ���virtual environment��� in which you can immerse yourself instead of just staring at a screen. Theoretically, the metaverse would be a place where people can meet, work and play using virtual reality headsets, augmented reality glasses, smartphone apps or other devices.

It might sound like science fiction, but then again, not long ago so were computers that fit in your pocket, driverless cars and microwaves that talk to you. Technology barrels ahead whether we like it or not and, to quote a vintage Facebook motivational poster in the company���s headquarters, ���fortune favors the bold.��� Despite an enormous backlash to Facebook���s problems ranging from misinformation and privacy mishaps to teen mental health and hate speech, Zuckerberg continues to believe that bold bets to steer the company in new directions have generally paid off.

In a Wednesday conference call, Zuckerberg said the company���s investments this year will focus on Reels ��� a TikTok-esque short form video service on Instagram ��� as well as messaging, ads, commerce, privacy, artificial intelligence ���and, of course, the metaverse.���

���Making meaningful progress across all seven of these areas is going to improve the services we offer today and will help power a social, intuitive, and entertaining metaverse,��� he said. But he acknowledged that ���this fully realized vision is still a ways off, and although the direction is clear, our path ahead is not perfectly defined.���

But while Wall Street���s metaverse optimism appears to fall well short off Zuckerberg���s, Meta���s rivals are ramping up their own metaverse projects. This includes Apple, Google and Microsoft, which recently bought the video game company Activision Blizzard with the hopes of accelerating its ambitions for the metaverse.

But it���s not just the big companies. According to app analytics company SensorTower, 86 apps added ���metaverse��� to their title or description from November 2021 through January of this year. To date, 552 mobile apps include the term ���metaverse��� in their title or description.

Stifel analyst Mark Kelley sought to calm investors, noting that Zuckerberg outlined not one but seven investment priorities for the company this year. He said he doesn���t think Meta���s initial goal of reaching 1 billion metaverse users is a stretch ��� and importantly, he believes only 40% would be gamers, signaling its broader appeal.

Meta���s stock plunge doesn���t discourage metaverse enthusiast and venture capitalist Matthew Ball, who months before Facebook���s renaming started an index fund of metaverse-related companies. Meta the company is one of the 45 stocks in Ball���s index.

���Mark���s focus on the next-generation internet is actually justified by the fact they can see in their core business that growth is slowing, that users are shifting elsewhere, and in particular, young users are shifting to these virtual and immersive worlds where they���re a small participant and where their investments are focused,��� he said.

0,Japanese game maker Nintendo���s profits hurt by chips crunch,"TOKYO (AP) ��� Nintendo���s profit for the nine months through December slipped 2.5%, as shortages of computer chips hurt production, the Japanese video game maker behind the Super Mario and Pokemon franchises said Thursday.

Kyoto-based Nintendo Co. recorded a 367 billion yen ($3.2 billion) profit for the period, down from 377 billion yen the previous year. Its sales in the same period fell 6% to 1.3 trillion yen ($11 billion).

Game makers have reaped windfall profits from more people staying home during the pandemic. But sales of Nintendo Switch consoles had more momentum in the previous fiscal year, driven by its hit ���Animal Crossing: New Horizons.���

Console sales are often driven by hit games, although the devices tend to sell better early on and then slowly decline in popularity.

Nintendo cut its forecast for Switch console sales for the fiscal year through March to 23 million machines. It had forecast 24 million units, previously slashed from an projection of 25.5 million units.

President Shuntaro Furukawa has said the dearth of computer chips has hindered output, complicating planning for the next fiscal year and beyond.

The problem has also slowed the design process for its next game machine. Nintendo is developing a device to follow the Switch.

Despite the setbacks, more than 100 million Switch machines have sold so far globally. Its most popular games for the latest period were ���Pok��mon Brilliant Diamond��� and ���Pok��mon Shining Pearl,��� and new Mario Kart and Mario Party games.

���Pokemon Legends Arceus,��� which went on sale last month, and the latest Kirby game, set for release in March, are expected to boost sales in the final fiscal quarter, according to Nintendo.

Nintendo faces stiff competition both from longtime rivals such as Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp. and from newcomers like Netflix and Google.

Microsoft recently announced it���s acquiring Activision Blizzard, the maker of Candy Crush and Call of Duty, for $68.7 billion, turning the maker of the Xbox into one of the world���s largest game companies.

Sony, which makes the PlayStation series of consoles, is acquiring Bungie Inc., known for its Halo and Destiny games, for $3.6 billion. Such acquisitions add game titles under their wings and in effect dwarf Nintendo.
