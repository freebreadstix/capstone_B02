516,United States health care facilities face an intravenous bag shortage because of the devastation wreaked by Hurricane Maria in September 2017.,"SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO — When things went bad during Hurricane Maria, they went bad all at once, across this entire island. Suddenly, everything was dysfunctional, including the power grid, the cellphone towers, the banking system. Even the disaster managers, the professionals in charge of responding to hurricanes, were forced to evacuate the buildings where they had sheltered during the powerful storm.

They shifted operations to the convention center here, an improvised maneuver that was just one of the reasons the government struggled to meet the challenges Maria presented. They were in the dark. The island’s residents were in the dark. No one knew the extent of what had happened — or what was happening — for days.

“Everything collapsed,” said Héctor Pesquera, the Puerto Rico governor’s director of safety and public protection. “Everything collapsed simultaneously.”

Nearly two weeks after Maria caused a historic catastrophe and thrust Puerto Rico into a humanitarian crisis, President Trump on Tuesday is scheduled to make his first visit to the island since the storm hit on Sept. 20.

Trump is expected to meet with Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, who has repeatedly expressed appreciation for federal support from Washington. It is unclear whether Trump will encounter San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, who has sharply criticized the federal effort, saying that Puerto Ricans are dying while the nation’s bureaucracy stumbles.

Trump has tweeted attacks on Cruz’s leadership, and the president has repeatedly said that stories highlighting the slow response to the crisis are fake news.

That view was echoed, if in a more subtle way, by the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s administrator on Monday after he flew to the island and, as he told reporters, saw signs of civic vibrancy in San Juan. William “Brock” Long said he managed to get a cellphone signal when he was 20 minutes outside the capital and heading to a remote area.

“As we were going down the road, I saw numerous fuel trucks with security, I saw numerous water trucks with security,” he said. “I saw a lot of resilient Puerto Ricans. I saw neighbors helping neighbors. I didn’t see anybody in a life-threatening situation at all.”

[Trapped in the mountains, Puerto Ricans don’t see help, or a way out]

The statutory requirements and protocols of disaster management are complex. The Defense Department has authority to send some of its assets where it sees fit, and in the case of Hurricane Maria did not initially deploy as many ships, sailors and soldiers as it could have. But the Defense Department is supposed to support, and follow the guidance of, FEMA. FEMA, in turn, is supposed to support the local and state (and in this case, territory) government.

Political sensitivities enter the calculation — with governors invariably wanting to show command and control — as was the case with Rosselló, who on Thursday took pains to say that the government of Puerto Rico is fully in charge of the Maria disaster response.

“The last thing a political leader wants to admit is that the problem is beyond their control,” said retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, who played a critical role in the federal responses to Hurricane Katrina and the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. “There has to be a frank, unvarnished conversation about the scope of the problem and how to deal with it. It is politically hard but operationally essential.”

Even before Maria, Puerto Rico had been hobbling along economically amid a financial crisis and at the same time convulsing politically. Now comes the longer-term question of whether the island can rebuild its economy and stave off wholesale flight of its residents to the mainland.

Rosselló, trying to steer attention toward the broader issues facing Puerto Rico, said on Sunday: “I invite you to reflect on why Puerto Rico is in the current state of disadvantage and inequality. It’s not something that happened just a few months or few weeks before this storm. It is a condition that has happened for more than a century in Puerto Rico. . . . I invite you to reflect on the reality that even after the storm hit Puerto Rico, even when it was evident that it was a disaster in the United States, only half of our U.S. citizens knew that Puerto Ricans were U.S. citizens.”

Roselló and other officials have not denied that the government struggled to provide food, water, medicine and fuel in the wake of Maria, but they have pointed to the challenges of being an island 1,000 miles from the mainland, as well as the communication breakdowns they experienced.

The scale of the disaster became clear only when mayors from across the island arrived in San Juan on Sept. 23, three days after the storm, for a meeting at the convention center at which they delivered dire reports in person. The U.S. government did not ramp up all of its capabilities until six days had passed. Last Tuesday, the Pentagon dispatched an Army one-star general to the island and then quickly elevated that command by sending in a three-star general.

[‘If anyone can hear us . . . help.’ Puerto Rico’s mayors describe widespread devastation from Hurricane Maria]

“Every day we get more and more situational awareness,” said John Rabin, the acting administrator for the FEMA division that oversees Puerto Rico. “As soon as we recognized there was a need for more resources and more capability, we ordered up that proverbial bigger boat.”

Asked if the response was slow, he went silent for a few beats.

“It’s not that it was ‘slow’; it’s ‘complex,’ is the way I would describe it,” Rabin said.

He cited one example of the way the response is evolving: FEMA and the Puerto Rico emergency managers sent relief supplies to 11 locations around the island. But the lack of communication meant that many people were not showing up for the supplies. Officials since have been using military helicopters to carry aid to rural locations.

The difficulty in responding to Maria has revealed how unique each disaster is — and how resistant to a one-size-fits-all approach. Hurricane Harvey, for example, created a flooding disaster in Houston and other cities in southern Texas, and thousands of people had to be rescued from their homes, often by civilians using private boats.

For Maria, numerous Coast Guard and FEMA urban-search-and-rescue teams were on hand or arrived quickly. But it soon became clear that what people needed most were life-sustaining provisions — including water, food and diesel fuel for generators — that the search-and-rescue teams didn’t have.

Senior officials in the Pentagon debated sending additional assistance in the first few days after the storm, including deploying a 1,000-bed hospital ship, the USNS Comfort, under their own authority. They decided instead to fill requests from the Puerto Rico government to send a couple of 50-bed hospital units that could be set up on shore.

Long visited Puerto Rico last Monday, and afterward the Pentagon’s effort changed. The next day Long appeared at the White House and announced the deployment of the Comfort.

Several U.S. military officials with knowledge of Puerto Rico operations said afterward that they hadn’t known about the ship’s deployment. The Comfort was not yet ready to sail.

Military officials said they have filled every request they have received in a timely fashion. The Navy had two amphibious combat ships, the USS Kearsarge and the USS Oak Hill, already in the region in response to Hurricane Irma, and after maneuvering to avoid Maria they sailed to Puerto Rico with a complement of Marines and sailors aboard. The Coast Guard had at least nine ships off the Puerto Rico coast shortly after the storm.

The unpredictable path of the storm played a role in the decision to send some ships, notably the USS Iwo Jima and USS New York, to ports on the mainland rather than to Puerto Rico in advance of Maria, the officials said. When pressed, they acknowledged that the ships could have steered clear of the storm while at sea and responded to the storm sooner.

As of Monday, there were 10 Army helicopters, 17 Navy and Marine Corps helicopters, and 10 National Guard helicopters involved in the Maria response, with an additional 12 Army Black Hawk helicopters and four MV-22 Osprey arriving soon, the Pentagon said.

546,Does the 2017 Tax Reform Bill Help Private Schools and Hurt Public Schools?,"The SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy is issuing this Investor Bulletin to provide investors with background information on 529 plans. Please also see our companion Bulletin for a few questions to consider before opening a 529 plan account. 

What is a 529 plan?

A 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings plan designed to encourage saving for future education costs. 529 plans, legally known as “qualified tuition plans,” are sponsored by states, state agencies, or educational institutions and are authorized by Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code. 

There are two types of 529 plans: prepaid tuition plans and education savings plans. All fifty states and the District of Columbia sponsor at least one type of 529 plan. In addition, a group of private colleges and universities sponsor a prepaid tuition plan. 

What are the differences between prepaid tuition plans and education savings plans? 

Prepaid Tuition Plans. Prepaid tuition plans let a saver or account holder purchase units or credits at participating colleges and universities (usually public and in-state) for future tuition and mandatory fees at current prices for the beneficiary. Prepaid tuition plans usually cannot be used to pay for future room and board at colleges and universities and do not allow you to prepay for tuition for elementary and secondary schools.

Most prepaid tuition plans are sponsored by state governments and have residency requirements for the saver and/or beneficiary. Prepaid plans are not guaranteed by the federal government. Some state governments guarantee the money paid into the prepaid tuition plans that they sponsor, but some do not. If your prepaid tuition payments aren’t guaranteed, you may lose some or all of your money in the plan if the plan’s sponsor has a financial shortfall. In addition, if a beneficiary doesn’t attend a participating college or university, the prepaid tuition plan may pay less than if the beneficiary attended a participating college or university. It may only pay a small return on the original investment.

Education Savings Plans. Education savings plans let a saver open an investment account to save for the beneficiary’s future qualified higher education expenses – tuition, mandatory fees and room and board. Withdrawals from education savings plan accounts can generally be used at any college or university, including sometimes at non-U.S. colleges and universities. Education savings plans can also be used to pay up to $10,000 per year per beneficiary for tuition at any public, private or religious elementary or secondary school.  

A saver may typically choose among a range of investment portfolio options, which often include various mutual fund and exchange-traded fund (ETF) portfolios and a principal-protected bank product. These portfolios also may include static fund portfolios and age-based portfolios (sometimes called target-date portfolios). Typically age-based portfolios automatically shift toward more conservative investments as the beneficiary gets closer to college age. If you are using a 529 account to pay for elementary or secondary school tuition, you may have a shorter time horizon for your money to grow. You also may not feel comfortable taking on riskier or more volatile investments if you plan on withdrawing the money soon. Because of these things, you may consider different investment options depending on when you plan to use the money that is invested.

All education savings plans are sponsored by state governments, but only a few have residency requirements for the saver and/or beneficiary. State governments do not guarantee investments in education savings plans. Education savings plan investments in mutual funds and ETFs are not federally guaranteed, but investments in some principal-protected bank products may be insured by the FDIC. As with most investments, investments in education savings plans may not make any money and could lose some or all of the money invested.

What fees and expenses will I pay if I invest in a 529 plan? 

It is important to understand the fees and expenses associated with 529 plans because they lower your returns. Fees and expenses will vary based on the type of 529 plan (education savings plan or prepaid tuition plan), whether it is a broker- or direct-sold plan, the plan itself and the underlying investments. You should carefully review the plan’s offering circular to understand what fees are charged for the plan and each investment option.

Prepaid Tuition Plans. Prepaid tuition plans may charge an enrollment/application fee and ongoing administrative fees.  

Education Savings Plans. Education savings plans may charge an enrollment/application fee, annual account maintenance fees, ongoing program management fees, and ongoing asset management fees. Some of these fees are collected by the state sponsor of the plan and some are collected by the plan manager. The asset management fees will depend on the investment option you select. Investors that purchase an education savings plan from a broker are typically subject to additional fees, such as sales loads or charges at the time of investment or redemption and ongoing distribution fees.

Fee Saving Tips. Many states offer direct-sold education savings plans in which savers can invest without paying additional broker-charged fees. In addition, some education savings plans will waive or reduce the administrative or maintenance fees if you maintain a large account balance, participate in an automatic contribution plan, or are a resident of the state sponsoring the 529 plan. Some 529 plans also offer fee waivers if the saver accepts electronic-only delivery of documents or enrolls online.

How does investing in a 529 plan affect federal and state income taxes? 

Investing in a 529 plan may offer savers special tax benefits. These benefits vary depending on the state and the 529 plan. In addition, state and federal laws that affect 529 plans could change. You should make sure you understand the tax implications of investing in a 529 plan and consider whether to consult a tax adviser.

Contributions. Many states offer tax benefits for contributions to a 529 plan. These benefits may include deducting contributions from state income tax or matching grants but may have various restrictions or requirements. In addition, savers may only be eligible for these benefits if you invest in a 529 plan sponsored by your state of residence.


Withdrawals. If you use 529 account withdrawals for qualified higher education expenses or tuition for elementary or secondary schools, earnings in the 529 account are not subject to federal income tax and, in many cases, state income tax. However, if 529 account withdrawals are not used for qualified higher education expenses or tuition for elementary or secondary schools, they will be subject to state and federal income taxes and an additional 10% federal tax penalty on earnings.

One of the benefits of 529 plans is the tax-free earnings that grow over a period of time. The longer your money is invested, the more time it has to grow and the greater your tax benefits. You will lose some of these potential benefits if you withdraw money from a 529 plan account within a short period of time after it is contributed.

What restrictions apply to an investment in a 529 plan?

There will likely be restrictions on any 529 plan you may be considering. Before you invest in a 529 plan, you should read the plan’s offering circular to make sure that you understand and are comfortable with any plan restrictions.

Investments. Education savings plans have certain pre-set investment options. It is not permitted to switch freely among the options. Under current tax law, an account holder is only permitted to change his or her investment option twice per year or when there is a change in the beneficiary.


Withdrawals. With limited exceptions, you can only withdraw money that you invest in an education savings plan for qualified higher education expenses or tuition for elementary or secondary schools without incurring taxes and penalties. Beneficiaries of prepaid tuition plans may only use their purchased credits or units at participating colleges or universities.  If a beneficiary doesn’t attend a participating college or university, the prepaid tuition plan may pay less than if the beneficiary attended a participating college or university. It may only pay a small return on the original investment.

Does investing in a 529 plan impact financial aid eligibility?

While each educational institution may treat assets held in a 529 account differently, investing in a 529 plan will generally impact a student’s eligibility to receive need-based financial aid for college. You may also need to consider how having money in your 529 account for future qualified higher education expenses might affect financial aid for your student’s elementary or secondary school tuition. For many families, the larger part of a financial aid package may be in loans. So, the more you can save for school, the less debt you or your student may have to incur.

Where can I find more information? 

Offering Circulars for 529 Plans. You can find out more about a particular 529 plan by reading its offering circular. The National Association of State Treasurers created the College Savings Plan Network, which provides links to most 529 plan websites. 


529 Expense Analyzer. 529 education savings plans have fees and expenses that can vary widely from plan to plan.  The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has developed a tool to help you compare how these fees and expenses can reduce returns.


Underlying Mutual Funds or Exchange-Traded Funds. Additional information about a mutual fund or ETF that is an investment option in an education savings plan is available in its prospectus, statement of additional information, and semiannual and annual shareholder reports. You can obtain these documents from the plan manager for no charge. You can also review these documents on the SEC’s EDGAR database. 

Fees and Expenses. You can read about the impact fees and expenses have on your investment portfolios in the SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy’s Investor Bulletin:  How Fees and Expenses Affect Your Investment Portfolio.


Brokers or Investment Advisers. Many education savings plans’ program managers are registered investment advisers. You can search for an investment adviser and view its Form ADV on Investor.gov. You can also search for any disciplinary sanctions against a broker who may sell a 529 savings plan product, as well as information about his or her professional background and registration and licensing status, on Investor.gov. 

Financial Aid.  You can read more about federal financial aid at the U.S. Department of Education’s Federal Student Aid website. 


Other Online Resources. You can learn more about 529 plans and other education saving options on FINRA’s Saving for College website. The website contains links to other sites, including the College Savings Plan Network and the Internal Revenue Service’s Publication 970 (Tax Benefits for Higher Education).

Long Island, Bahamas: Where's the ocean?

Angela Fritz, The Washington Post’s deputy weather editor, confirmed this phenomenon is real and may occur during extremely powerful hurricanes such as Irma. The storm is so powerful, it can essentially change the shape of the ocean, Fritz said.
“Basically, Hurricane Irma is so strong and its pressure is so low, it’s sucking water from its surroundings into the core of the storm,” Fritz wrote.
“In the center of the storm, where there is extreme low pressure, water is drawn upward. Low pressure is basically a sucking mechanism — it sucks the air into it, and when it’s really low, it can change the shape of the surface of the ocean. As the storm draws water toward the center, it gets pulled away from the surroundings.”
Wayne Neely, a forecaster with the Bahamas’ Department of Meteorology, warned residents of Long Island and Exuma, where water had also reportedly receded from the beaches, to be careful as the ocean returned back to high levels.
“Care must be taken in this case because the water often returns with even greater fury,” Neely said in a Facebook post explaining the phenomenon.

708,Can the FireChat App Send Messages Without an Internet Connection?,"FireChat makes use of a feature Apple introduced in the latest version of its iOS mobile software, iOS7, called multipeer connectivity. This feature allows phones to connect to one another directly using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi as an alternative to the Internet. If you’re using FireChat, its “nearby” chat room lets you exchange messages with other users within 100 feet without sending data via your cellular provider.

Micha Benoliel, CEO and cofounder of startup Open Garden, which made FireChat, says the app shows how smartphones can be set free from cellular networks. He hopes to enable many more Internet-optional apps with the upcoming release of software tools that will help developers build FireChat-style apps for iPhone, or for Android, Mac, and Windows devices. “This approach is very interesting for multiplayer gaming and all kinds of communication apps,” says Benoliel.

Anthony DiPasquale, a developer with consultancy Thoughtbot, says FireChat is the only app he’s aware of that’s been built to make use of multipeer connectivity, perhaps because the feature remains unfamiliar to most Apple developers. “I hope more people start to use it soon,” he says. “It’s an awesome framework with a lot of potential. There is probably a great use for multipeer connectivity in every situation where there are people grouped together wanting to share some sort of information.” DiPasquale has dabbled in using multipeer connectivity himself, creating an experimental app that streams music from one device to several others nearby.

The new feature of iOS7 currently only supports data moving directly from one device to another, and from one device to several others. However, Open Garden’s forthcoming software will extend the feature so that data can hop between two iPhones out of range of one another via intermediary devices. That approach, known as mesh networking, is at the heart of several existing projects to create disaster-proof or community-controlled communications networks (see “Build Your Own Internet with Mobile Mesh Networking”).

Apps built to exploit such device-to-device schemes can offer security and privacy benefits over those that rely on the Internet. For example, messages sent using FireChat to nearby devices don’t pass through any systems operated by either Open Garden or a wireless carrier (although they are broadcast to all FireChat users nearby).

That means the content of a message and metadata could not be harvested from a central communications hub by an attacker or government agency. “This method of communication is immune to firewalls like the ones installed in China and North Korea,” says Mattt Thompson, a software engineer who writes the iOS and Mac development blog NSHipster. Recent revelations about large-scale surveillance of online services and the constant litany of data breaches make this a good time for apps that don’t rely on central servers, he says. “As users become more mindful of the security and privacy implications of technologies they rely on, moving in the direction of local, ad-hoc networking makes a lot of sense.”

However, peer-to-peer and mesh networking apps also come with their own risks, since an eavesdropper could gain access to local traffic just by using a device within range.

Open Garden’s main product is an app that allows Android devices to share their Internet connections (see “Could You Spare Some Internet Access?”). However, Benoliel says that won’t be coming to the iPhone anytime soon because the feature that FireChat relies on cannot be used to share data connectivity.

Peer-to-peer mobile communications and mesh networks could prove especially important in countries with minimal communications infrastructure. “You can see Google spending billions on fiber and balloons, but this is not going to solve the problem of ubiquitous mobile connectivity,” Benoliel says. He argues that the spread of cheap Android phones across the world will make mesh networking feasible. “We need to create small Internets that can function on their own and [then] connect them to the big Internet.”",TRUE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/can-firechat-send-messages-without-internet/,Technology,Snopes
783,Is a Wisconsin Company Offering to Microchip its Employees?,"A Wisconsin company is to become the first in the US to microchip employees.

Three Square Market is offering to implant the tiny radio-frequency identification (RFID) chip into workers' hands for free - and says everyone will soon be doing it.

The rice grain-sized $300 (£230) chip will allow them to open doors, log in to computers and even purchase food.

And so far, 50 employees have signed up for the chance to become half-human, half-walking credit card.

But far from being some sort of dystopian nightmare, Three Square Market's Patrick McMullan believes everyone will soon be wanting their own microchip.

What does it feel like? BBC reporter gets chipped
""The international market place is wide open and we believe that the future trajectory of total market share is going to be driven by whoever captures this arena first,"" Mr McMullan said.


The company, which provides self-service ""micro markets"" to businesses around the world, was inspired by the micro-chipping already taking place in Sweden, where so-called ""bio-hackers"" have been inserting the tiny devices into willing participants for at least three years.

Three Square Market are even working with a Swedish company, BioHax, to deliver the new technology, which they see as one day being simply another payment and identification method - only instead of a credit card or phone, there would be a microchip between your thumb and finger.

But how did employees react?
While a large proportion of the world might think twice before putting a tiny chip in their hand, it seems those at Three Square Market had no such worries.

Out of 85 employees at the company's head office, 50 have come forward, vice-president of international development Tony Danna told the BBC.

""The people that wanted it were like yes, no hesitation,"" he said.

Can they be tracked?
""That is going to be the inevitable reaction,"" Mr Danna acknowledged.

""But there is no GPS tracking ability to it. It is really the same thing as the chip that is in your credit card.""

How does it go in - and how do you get it out?
The entire point of the chip is convenience, Mr Danna explained.

Eventually, he hopes it will replace everything you might have in your wallet - from your key fob to your credit card and ID. For now, it is just aiming to make life easier for those using Three Square Market's facilities.

But the convenience also stretches to installing and removing the chip.

""It takes about two seconds to put it in and to take it out,"" he told the BBC. Putting it in is ""like getting a shot"" using a syringe, while taking it out it like removing a splinter.

""Easy in, easy out,"" Mr Danna said.

What if you get robbed?
Like everything in life, it could happen.

But, says Mr Danna, at least it is all in one place, making it easier to cancel all those cards.",TRUE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/three-square-market-microchip/,Technology,Snopes
8245,Is Fentanyl-Laced Marijuana Use on the Rise?,"CINCINNATI, OH (WLWT) — Synthetic opiates like fentanyl have been found in marijuana, Hamilton County Coroner Dr. Lakshmi Sammarco confirmed to NBC affiliate WLWT-TV Monday.

Fentanyl, a drug 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine, has been linked to a surge of fatal overdoses across the county. It has been showing up in other drugs across the area.

“We have seen fentanyl mixed with cocaine, we have also seen fentanyl mixed with marijuana,” Sammarco said during a joint press conference with Sen. Rob Portman.

Sammarco said that there have already been 297 deaths in Hamilton County this year caused by suspected opioid overdose, compared to 403 confirmed deaths in all of 2016.

She did not specify how many cases involved marijuana mixed with a synthetic opiate.

“Essentially, the message we’ve tried to get out there, is if you are using any form of street drugs, count on them having some form of synthetic opioid mixed in,” Samarco said.

Samarco added that it is nearly impossible to tell which drugs are mixed with a synthetic opiate.

Meat inspectors reportedly found, what appeared to be, Human meat stored in the meat factory freezers of an Oklahoma City meat factory and human meat already in trucks right outside the factory ready to be shipped to McDonald’s restaurants. Health inspectors immediately demanded inspection in various McDonald’s meat factories across the country and horrifyingly found human meat in about 90% of the factories inspected thus far.

The USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) has seized McDonald’s production and shipping and will call for more meat factory inspections and restaurant inspections. The FBI is also investigating the factories. FBI agent Lloyd Harrison told Huzler reporters “The worst part is that it’s not only human meat, it’s child meat. the body parts that were found across the U.S. factories were deemed to small to be adult body parts, this is truly horrible”.

The situation brings up many unanswered questions. How long have they been using human meat? Where did they get the children from? Were they already dead when brought into factories? Investigators and Inspectors are currently being deployed for intensive investigations all around the U.S.

8455,A major Hepatitis A outbreak in San Diego has been pinned on undocumented immigrants there.,"Dean James AMERICA’S FREEDOM FIGHTERS–
The ultra liberal city of San Diego, California which incidentally is inundated with illegal aliens is facing a health crisis and authorities have declared PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY.
A public health emergency was declared Friday over an outbreak of ‘hepatitis A’ that has been linked to at least 15 deaths and 400 hospitalizations.
The liver disease outbreak started last November, with the homeless population affected most. The emergency declaration will help the city access state funds and provide legal protection for new sanitation measures, the Union-Tribune reported.
Areas with high concentrations of homeless people will receive roughly 40 portable hand-washing stations to help combat the disease, which can spread through fecal matter when people fail to thoroughly clean their hands after using the restroom.
Crews also plan to use bleach-spiked water for high-pressure washing to remove “all feces, blood, bodily fluids or contaminated surfaces,” according to a sanitation plan outlined in a letter Thursday.
Other cities in the region can expect to see similar hand-washing and street-sanitizing efforts, said Dr. Wilma Wooten, the region’s public health officer, FOX News reported.
After previous vaccination and educational programs failed to significantly reduce the infection rate, and with death reports spiking in recent weeks, San Diego decided to mimic a campaign used in Los Angeles, which is home to tens of thousands of homeless, in an attempt to curb the outbreak.
“We know that L.A. has had no local cases of hepatitis A related to the strain that we’re seeing here in San Diego,” Wooten said. “If they’re doing it there and they haven’t had any cases, it could be beneficial here as well.”
The moves in San Diego follow finger-pointing between city and county officials, with both sides insisting they were doing the best they could under tough circumstances, the newspaper said.
“There is no precedent for this,” Wooten said. “We will definitely have a playbook for if we have something like this in the future. But this is the first time we have had something of this nature happen.”

These kind of problems are typical in liberal cities.
Build the wall.

13,Republican Party the Strongest It's Been in 80 Years,"In 2014, we put together an index to measure the electoral strength of the parties. Rather than focusing on the presidency, we broke partisan control into five categories: presidential, Senate, House, governorships, and state legislatures. We have updated our index using the mostly complete data for the 2016 elections and can conclude that the GOP is in the strongest position it has been since 1928. In many sub-categories, it is near an all-time high. The following four paragraphs, taken verbatim from the previously linked article, describe our methodology: Our index is the sum of five parts: presidential performance, House performance, Senate performance, gubernatorial performance and state legislative performance. The first is measured by the partys performance in the previous presidential popular vote. (In this, and all other measurements, third parties are excluded.) House performance is the average of the popular vote for the House and the average of the share of the House won by the party. This helps mitigate the effects of gerrymandering. Senate performance is the share of the Senate held by the party. Gubernatorial performance is the partys share of governorships (again, with third party candidates excluded). We do not weight for population, for reasons explored further below. For state legislatures, we average four numbers: the share of state Houses and state Senates held by each party along with the share of state House seats and state Senate seats held by each party. This gives us five metrics, all of which run on a scale from 0 to 100. Adding them together gives us a scale from zero to 500. We then subtract 250 from the total. All this does is assign a score of zero to a situation where the parties are evenly matched, rather than 250. A positive score then means that the Republican Party is stronger while a negative score means the Democratic Party is stronger. Lets walk the through the sub-scores, one by one. In the state legislatures, Republicans modestly improved their positioning from the already strong position they had achieved in 2014. Their sub-score is 63.2 (again, on a scale of zero to 100). If we exclude the Reconstruction period, the Republican Party has achieved a higher score in the state legislatures in three elections: 1894 (64.7), 1904 (64.6), and 1920 (66.5). Likewise, in the governorships, the GOP emerged from 2016 stronger than it was after 2014. This is unsurprising, since Democrats were reduced to just 16 governorships. The GOPs sub-score of 67.3 was surpassed only in 1920 (70.8) and during the late Civil War and early Reconstruction period (1864, 1866, and 1868). The House, Senate and presidential charts pretty much speak for themselves: If we put everything together in our final index, the GOP has a Trende-Byler score of 36.0, the highest score for the GOP since 1928 (when it scored a staggering 51.8). You can see the trend line here: Note that the 2006 and 2008 elections now look decidedly like aberrations. It is hard to square this with an overall view of an ascendant Democratic Party, though there is still a lot of history to be written. Here is the overall trend line, dating back to 1856. The mean score over time is -3 points, and the median is -6. On a 500-point scale, this is basically nothing. This is consistent with the idea that elections over time tend toward parity. The standard deviation is 45, which is consistent with the idea that the GOP is in a strong position, but not an unusually dominant one. With this, we can make some preliminary assessments of the Obama presidency. Obviously, this was not a successful period for party building. But how bad was it in a comparative sense? The index swung 70 points against Democrats from 2008 to 2016. Among two-term presidents, only Dwight Eisenhower (78.2), Franklin Roosevelt (98), Ulysses Grant (118.1) and Woodrow Wilson (137.2) presided over larger swings against their party. If we look only at FDRs first two terms, he drops out, having lost only 40 index points. Given that President Obama oversaw reasonably robust growth throughout his term, unlike Eisenhower, Grant and Wilson, this is a jarring outcome. Nixon/Fords loss would barely be larger (72.4) if we lumped them together. Of the 30 presidents in our sample, only nine fared worse than Obama (Lyndon Johnson, Grover Cleveland in 1892, Eisenhower, James Buchanan, William Taft, FDR, Grant, Wilson and Herbert Hoover). Of course, the largest swing for any president occurred under Hoover; in four short years the index swung nearly 137 points against the GOP. This brings us to our final point: If you look over the broad sweep of history, this index has very little predictive power. The party that holds the presidency almost always loses strength, but the magnitude of that loss and how quickly it occurs is effectively random. Democrats should not be too discouraged by their present state of affairs. History teaches that it can be reversed, and rather quickly. Sean Trende is senior elections analyst for RealClearPolitics.

86,Ohio Has the Highest Payday Loan Prices in the Nation,"Nationwide, Americans in all demographic groups use payday loans. The only requirements to obtain such credit are a checking account and a source of income. Typical borrowers earn about $30,000 per year, and most use the loans to cover recurring expenses such as rent, mortgage payments, groceries, and utilities.1 Payday loans in Ohio are the countrys most expensive, with a typical annual percentage rate (APR) of 591 percent.2 Lenders charge higher prices in Ohio than in any neighboring state. Distressing signals 1 in 10 adults in Ohioroughly 1 million peoplehas taken out a payday loan. 3 No payday or auto title lenders are licensed under the Short-Term Loan Act, which passed the Ohio Legislature with bipartisan support in 2008 and was an attempt to curb payday loan rates. The industry then tried to get Ohio voters to repeal the legislative action. When that effort failed, lenders circumvented the law by obtaining licenses to operate as credit service organizations, which are not subject to fee limits. 4 Ohios market consists of more than 650 payday loan storefronts in 76 counties, more than 90 percent of which are owned and operated by companies that also do business in other states. 5 Payday loans in Ohio have unnecessarily high prices: Borrowers are charged up to four times what their peers pay in other states.6 (See Table 1.) Ohio can balance affordability and access to credit In 2010, Colorado lawmakers replaced conventional two-week payday loans with six-month installment payday loans at lower prices. Each year, borrowers in that state save more than $40 million, which goes back into the states economy. 7 After reform, access to credit remains widely available in Colorado. 8 An average loan payment consumes 4 percent of a borrowers next paycheck. 9 Borrowers have a pathway out of debt, and 75 percent of loans are repaid early. 10 With similarly sensible reforms, Ohio policymakers can reduce costs for their constituents, creating affordability for borrowers and a viable market for lenders. Federal rules are not enough to protect Ohioans Nationally, borrowers overwhelmingly want reform, with 8 in 10 favoring requirements that payments take up only a small amount of a borrowers paycheck with more time to repay the loan. 11 The federal agency that sets rules for these loans, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has proposed a requirement that lenders review borrowers credit reports and evaluate their debt obligations before making loans. 12 Under this requirement, however, the 400 and 500 percent APR payday and auto title loans that are on the market today would still be allowed in Ohio. Further, Ohios market has begun shifting to longer-term payday installment loans with similarly high APRs and unaffordable payments. 13 The Ohio General Assembly has the power to license and set reasonable terms for these loans; the federal agency does not.

98,"In California, You Can't Shower and Do Laundry on the Same Day","Now Its Against the Law in California to Shower and Do Laundry on the Same Day Share 4K Pin Shares 4K If you're new here, you may want to subscribe to my RSS feed. Thanks for visiting! by Daisy Luther Governor Jerry Brown is retiring but not before he passes a few draconian laws as parting gifts for California. Two bills were signed into law on Thursday of last week to help California be better prepared for future droughts and the effects of climate change. The mandatory water conservation standards will be permanent, according to their wording, and not just for use in times of crisis. To make a long story short, now that these bills are law, its effectively illegal to take a shower and do a load of laundry in the same day because youll exceed your ration. Ill explain why I say this in a moment. Heres the wording of the new laws. Senate Bill 606 establishes a governing body to oversee all water suppliers, both private and public and will require extensive paperwork from those utility companies. Assembly Bill 1668 is where it gets personal. This establishes limits on indoor water usage for every person in California and the amount allowed will decrease even further over the next 12 years. The bill, until January 1, 2025, would establish 55 gallons per capita daily as the standard for indoor residential water use, beginning January 1, 2025, would establish the greater of 52.5 gallons per capita daily or a standard recommended by the department and the board as the standard for indoor residential water use, and beginning January 1, 2030, would establish the greater of 50 gallons per capita daily or a standard recommended by the department and the board as the standard for indoor residential water use. The bill would impose civil liability for a violation of an order or regulation issued pursuant to these provisions, as specified. If youre wondering how the government would know how much water your family is using, the utility providers will be obligated to rat you out of face massive fines. And theyre encouraged to spy in all sorts of creative ways. They shall use satellite imagery, site visits, or other best available technology to develop an accurate estimate of landscaped areas. Some analysis Now, if youre wondering where I get my assertion that you cant shower and do laundry on the same day, heres some math: If you add together a 17-gallon shower with a 40-gallon load of laundry, you get 57 gallons of water, which exceeds your allotment of 55 gallons. Since this is now a law, breaking it, by definition, is illegal, right? There are also standards to be established for outdoor use such as landscaping, caring for livestock, and gardening, but those numbers dont seem to be available at this time. Maybe Californians just get to wait in suspense to see if their chickens are allowed to have water on the same day as their vegetables. Back when I lived in California, we were only allowed to water our gardens two times per week, which, in that heat, as you can imagine, didnt lead to very productive gardens. Farmers on a larger scale will have to jump through numerous hoops and create water management plans which must then be approved by the people in suits because obviously, theyll know more about the needs of crops and livestock than the farmers will Oh, and dont worry, rich people. There will be provisions for swimming pools, spas, and other water features. So you can still have your pretty fountains and pools while the rest of the peons take 2 showers a week. One might wonder if variances will apply to the wealthy for their landscaping needs. The State Water Resources Control Board, which will oversee local agencies progress, will also consider possible variances for some districts that need additional allowances due to specific local circumstances. (source) Both Brown and his most-likely successor, Gavin Newsom, want to spend $17 billion to build a tunnel that will bring water from resource-rich Northern California down to bone-dry Southern California. This means, even the parts of California that DO have water will be restricted in its use. What if you dont comply? If you dont plan to comply its going to be way cheaper to move. Here are the fines Californians will be looking at and its not a typo these fines are PER DAY. (1) If the violation occurs in a critically dry year immediately preceded by two or more consecutive below normal, dry, or critically dry years or during a period for which the Governor has issued a proclamation of a state of emergency under the California Emergency Services Act (Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 8550) of Division 1 of Title 2 of the Government Code) based on drought conditions, ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for each day in which the violation occurs. (2) For all violations other than those described in paragraph (1), one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each day in which the violation occurs. Who will be billed for these violations? The utility companies, as several commenters have angrily pointed out. But do you really think that if you are racking up thousand dollar fines that theyre just going to say, Gosh, I wish you wouldnt use so much water, Mr. Customer. Were operating at a dramatic loss. Can you please do better next time? No, of course not. Those fines, while they may not be assessed to you directly by the government, will indeed come out of YOUR pocket. To think otherwise is the height of delusion. But hey, if you want to nitpick and act like Im being ridiculous, go ahead and think that all those fines will just be absorbed by the utility company. Its important to note that your usage is only tracked if you have municipal water. If you have a well, at this point, you will probably be okay. Back when I lived there, the idea of metering private wells and billing the owners for use had been floated around, but most people resisted and it wasnt enforced. If you truck your water in, you can also use as much as you need to. For years it was illegal to use greywater systems in California, despite the epic droughts. Those regulations have been loosened, however, compliance is still extremely onerous. (Get the details here.) And rainwater catchment is not only legal, its encouraged. In fact, theres a ballot on the table that is a measure to allow rainwater capture systems to be installed without counting as new construction for the purposes of reassessing property taxes. Dont think this only affects California Not only are Californians fleeing the state in droves, but there are other ways these restrictive laws can affect the rest of us directly. These stringent measures set a dangerous precedent for the rest of the country. There could be a shortage of food coming out of California because there isnt enough water to produce it. The food we do get from there will cost a lot more. Its important to pay attention to stuff like this and not shrug it off because I dont live in California. In an economy such as ours, were all interlinked. A draconian law that gains a footing in one part of the country is much easier to pass in other parts.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/07/blog-posting/it-illegal-shower-and-do-laundry-same-day-californ/,"Corrections and Updates, Environment, Fake news, Water",
122,"Ken Paxton arrested, booked; indictment released","Facing three felony counts of securities law violations, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton was arrested, fingerprinted and photographed Monday morning for alleged violations that took place when he was a state legislator. Indicted by a Collin County grand jury last week, Paxton surrendered at the county jail in his hometown of McKinney, avoiding assembled reporters by entering through a side door. He posted three personal-recognizance bonds for a total of $35,000 no money was required to change hands before being released about 20 minutes later. Attorney General Ken Paxton will plead not guilty to these accusations, and he will demand a trial by jury, Paxton lawyer Joe Kendall said afterward. He is looking forward to the opportunity to tell his side of the story in the courtroom. Democrats called for Paxton to step down, while Republican leaders asked the public to let the legal process play out. The grand jury indictments against Paxton, unsealed shortly after noon, revealed that two first-degree fraud charges were based on Paxtons efforts in July 2011 when he was a member of the Texas House to sell stock on behalf of Servergy Inc., a privately held, McKinney-based tech company. According to the indictments, Paxton failed to tell stock buyers including state Rep. Byron Cook, R-Corsicana, and Florida businessman Joel Hochberg, who each purchased more than $100,000 in Servergy stock and were listed as complainants on the fraud charges that he had been compensated with 100,000 shares of Servergy. Paxton also said he was an investor in Servergy when he had not invested his own money in the company, the charges indicated. Cook did not immediately return a call for comment Monday. Paxton encouraged investors to put more than $600,000 into Servergy, special prosecutor Kent Schaffer told The New York Times last week. Paxtons role was discovered as part of a Texas Rangers investigation, Schaffer said. First-degree felonies can be punished by up to life in prison. A third charge, a third-degree felony, accused Paxton of acting as an investment adviser representative in July 2012 without registering with the State Securities Board. Paxton, sworn in as attorney general in January, is not required to leave office while he fights the charges, and Kendall said his client returned to Austin after being booked to focus on his work on behalf of the citizens of Texas. Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa said Paxton should step down immediately. He needs to spare Texas the embarrassment of a drawn-out legal fight in the public eye, take responsibility and accept the consequences, Hinojosa said. It is time to restore the public trust. It is time for a Republican to finally act responsibly. Texans for Public Justice, an Austin-based liberal watchdog group that filed a criminal complaint against Paxton last year, also called for Paxtons resignation. Hes abused the faith in his public office and, according to the indictments, hes engaged in outright deception for his personal profit, and thats why we think he should step aside, Director Craig McDonald said. The Republican Party of Texas criticized the sloppy process that led to the indictments against one of the partys statewide leaders, saying Paxton deserves to have his say in a court of law rather than be judged in a court of public opinion. Since being overwhelmingly elected by the voters of Texas, (Attorney) General Paxton has helped lock up child predators, investigated the odious acts of Planned Parenthood, relentlessly pushed back against an overreaching federal government, and we expect him to fight these allegations with that same zeal, party spokesman Aaron Whitehead said. Leading Republicans, including Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, stopped short of defending Paxton, issuing statements Monday reminding voters that the indictments and arrest were the first steps in a long legal process. It is important to recognize that an indictment is not a conviction. Under our Constitution, every person is innocent until proven guilty, Patrick said. Paxtons mugshot, showing him with a half-smile, was quickly released to the public drawing inevitable comparisons to booking photos of then-U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, who chose a wide smile in 2005, and then-Gov. Rick Perry, who wore a genial smile last year. The arraignment when the charges will be read aloud and Paxton will enter his plea will take place in the coming weeks. Kendall said he and Paxton will follow instructions from state District Judge George Gallagher, a Fort Worth Republican and 15-year judge appointed to handle Paxtons case, who has asked prosecutors and defense lawyers to make no further public comments or publicly speculate on events. The two appointed special prosecutors, Houston defense lawyers Brian Wice and Schaffer, were not in Collin County and declined to comment Monday.",TRUE,http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2018/jun/07/justin-nelson/justin-nelson-ken-paxton-only-indicted-statewide-o/,"Candidate Biography, Crime, Criminal Justice, History",

After saying Starbucks wants to embrace diversity of all kinds, he told a shareholder who supports traditional marriage that he should sell his shares and invest in some other company. According to a report by Forbes, Schultz seemed a bit intolerant of any Starbucks shareholders who opposed gay marriage for moral or religious reasons. During the meeting, shareholder Tom Strobhar (who founded the Corporate Morality Action Center) pointed out that after the company voiced its support for a referendum backing gay marriage in Washington state, a boycott by traditional marriage supporters caused a drop in sales revenue. Schultz told him You can sell your shares in Starbucks and buy shares in another company if he did not agree with the companys pro-gay marriage stand. Despite strong opposition from the religious and political right, support for gay marriage in America has risen in recent years. The rise of support for gay marriage has also seen a rise of intolerance for those who oppose it. Many who joined the boycott of Starbucks last yearwere dismissed as bigots, even though the boycott did cause revenue to drop.

310,BOMBSHELL!! Obama Paid FBI Informant Over $1 MILLION To Do It To Trump! EVEN AFTER THE ELECTION!,"Just mere hours ago, General Michael Flynns son, Michael Flynn Jr., sent out a very odd tweet which some say may be in reference to the payments that have been traced from the corrupt Barack Hussein Obama regime to the now notorious FBI informant, Stephan Halper. The tweet reads warning: Youre all going down. You know who you are. Mark my word. Youre all going down. You know who you are. Mark my word. MFLYNNJR (@mflynnJR) May 21, 2018 ts now being reported that less than a week after Stefan Halper was confirmed to be an informant for the FBI who was the one who infiltrated the Trump campaign back in 2016, there is now alleged confirmation that the 73-year-old Oxford University professor and former U.S. government official was paid handsomely by the Obama administration starting in 2012 for various research projects. Halper, who is said to be a longtime CIA and FBI asset, once even reportedly ran a spy-operation on the Jimmy Carter administration during the late 70s, was recruited by the FBI to spy on several Trump campaign aides during the 2016 U.S. election. But here is the kicker. An astringent search of public records is now revealing that between 2012 and 2018, Halper received a total of $1,058,161 from the Department of Defense. Why would anyone receive that kind of money from the DOJ? Especially someone like Halper? Stefan Halper was the same person who invited George Papadopolous to London, where he just so happened to sit down next to that infamous Australian Diplomat (who also worked with the Clinton Foundation) Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) May 11, 2018 In essence, Stefan Halper was the bag-man who enabled Brennan and Clapper to carry out the spying against the Trump Campaign at Obamas request Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) May 11, 2018 Interestingly enough, the most recent payment to Halper for $411,575 was made in two different installments which had a start date of September 26, 2016, only three days after a September 23 news article by Michael Isikoff was published about Trump aide Carter Page. The article used information fed to Isikoff by the fake Russian dossier creator Christopher Steele. It was later confirmed that the FBI used that article, along with the unverified Russian dossier as supporting evidence in a FISA warrant application for Page. Via 100% Fed Up: According to the Website USASPENDING.gov, the payments to Halper are for RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES (2012), RESEARCH AND STUDIES THE YEAR 2030, (2014), RUSSIA-CHINA RELATIONSHIP STUDY. (2015), and INDIA AND CHINA ECON STUDY (2016). Halpers most recent award was noted recently by Trump supporter Jacob Wohl, which piqued the interest of internet researchers who continued the analysis. Stefan Halper was the same person who invited George Papadopolous to London, where he just so happened to sit down next to that infamous Australian Diplomat (who also worked with the Clinton Foundation) Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) May 11, 2018 Wohl calls Stefan Halper the bag man who enabled Brennan and Clapper to carry out the spying against the Trump Campaign at Obamas request: In essence, Stefan Halper was the bag-man who enabled Brennan and Clapper to carry out the spying against the Trump Campaign at Obamas request Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) May 11, 2018 The second installment of Halpers 2016 DoD contract is dated July 26, 2017 in the amount of $129,280 around three months before the FISA warrant on Carter Page was set to expire following repeated renewals signed by Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein and a federal judge. On July 28, he emailed Page with what the Trump campaign aide describes as a cordial communication, which did not seem suspicious to him at the time. In the email to Page, Halper asks what his plans are post-election, possibly probing for more information. It seems attention has shifted a bit from the collusion investigation to the contretempts [sic] within the White House and, howor ifMr. Scaramucci will be accommodated there, Halper wrote. How much time has the MSM spent talking about the massive cash payments sent to Stefan Halper to spy on our President? ZERO. Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) May 21, 2018 Halper approached Page during an election-themed conference at Cambridge on July 11, 2016, six weeks before the September 26 Department of Justice payment start date. They would remain in contact for the next 14 months where they frequently met and exchanged emails. Here is the infamous article via Yahoo News: U.S. intelligence officials are seeking to determine whether an American businessman identified by Donald Trump as one of his foreign policy advisers has opened up private communications with senior Russian officials including talks about the possible lifting of economic sanctions if the Republican nominee becomes president, according to multiple sources who have been briefed on the issue. The activities of Trump adviser Carter Page, who has extensive business interests in Russia, have been discussed with senior members of Congress during recent briefings about suspected efforts by Moscow to influence the presidential election, the sources said. After one of those briefings, Senate minority leader Harry Reid wrote FBI Director James Comey, citing reports of meetings between a Trump adviser (a reference to Page) and high ranking sanctioned individuals in Moscow over the summer as evidence of significant and disturbing ties between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin that needed to be investigated by the bureau. Some of those briefed were taken aback when they learned about Pages contacts in Moscow, viewing them as a possible back channel to the Russians that could undercut U.S. foreign policy, said a congressional source familiar with the briefings but who asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject. The source added that U.S. officials in the briefings indicated that intelligence reports about the advisers talks with senior Russian officials close to President Vladimir Putin were being actively monitored and investigated. A senior U.S. law enforcement official did not dispute that characterization when asked for comment by Yahoo News. Its on our radar screen, said the official about Pages contacts with Russian officials. Its being looked at. Page is a former Merrill Lynch investment banker in Moscow who now runs a New York consulting firm, Global Energy Capital, located around the corner from Trump Tower, that specializes in oil and gas deals in Russia and other Central Asian countries. He declined repeated requests to comment for this story. Trump first mentioned Pages name when asked to identify his foreign policy team during an interview with the Washington Post editorial team last March. Describing him then only as a PhD, Trump named Page as among five advisers that we are dealing with. But his precise role in the campaign remains unclear; Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks last month called him an informal foreign adviser who does not speak for Mr. Trump or the campaign. Asked this week by Yahoo News, Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller said Page has no role and added: We are not aware of any of his activities, past or present. Miller did not respond when asked why Trump had previously described Page as one of his advisers. The questions about Page come amid mounting concerns within the U.S. intelligence community about Russian cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and state election databases in Arizona and Illinois. In a rare public talk this week, former undersecretary of defense for intelligence Mike Vickers said that the Russian cyberattacks constituted meddling in the U.S. election and were beyond the pale. Also, this week, two senior Democrats Sen. Dianne Feinstein, ranking minority member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Rep. Adam Schiff, ranking minority member on the House Intelligence Committee released a joint statement that went further then what U.S. officials had publicly said about the matter. Based on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election, they said. At the least, this effort is intended to sow doubt about the security of our election and may well be intended to influence the outcomes of the election. They added that orders for the Russian intelligence agencies to conduct such actions could come only from very senior levels of the Russian government. Page came to the attention of officials at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow several years ago when he showed up in the Russian capital during several business trips and made provocative public comments critical of U.S. policy and sympathetic to Putin. He was pretty much a brazen apologist for anything Moscow did, said one U.S. official who served in Russia at the time. He hasnt been shy about expressing those views in the U.S. as well. Last March, shorty after he was named by Trump as one of his advisers, Page told Bloomberg News he had been an adviser to, and investor in, Gazprom, the Russian state-owned gas company. He then blamed Obama administration sanctions imposed as a response to the Russian annexation of Crimea for driving down the companys stock. So many people who I know and have worked with have been so adversely affected by the sanctions policy, Page said in the interview. Theres a lot of excitement in terms of the possibilities for creating a better situation. Page showed up again in Moscow in early July, just two weeks before the Republican National Convention formally nominated Trump for president, and once again criticized U.S. policy. Speaking at a commencement address for the New Economic School, an institution funded in part by major Russian oligarchs close to Putin, Page asserted that Washington and other West capitals had impeded progress in Russia through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change. At the time, Page declined to say whether he was meeting with Russian officials during his trip, according to a Reuters report. But U.S. officials have since received intelligence reports that during that same three-day trip, Page met with Igor Sechin, a longtime Putin associate and former Russian deputy prime minister who is now the executive chairman of Rosneft, Russians leading oil company, a well-placed Western intelligence source tells Yahoo News. That meeting, if confirmed, is viewed as especially problematic by U.S. officials because the Treasury Department in August 2014 named Sechin to a list of Russian officials and businessmen sanctioned over Russias illegitimate and unlawful actions in the Ukraine. (The Treasury announcement described Sechin as utterly loyal to Vladimir Putin a key component to his current standing. At their alleged meeting, Sechin raised the issue of the lifting of sanctions with Page, the Western intelligence source said.

313,USA: Mysterious Nazi submarine from WWII discovered in Great Lakes!,"Niagara Falls| Divers from the U.S coast guard took part this morning, in a delicate wreck recoveryoperation to bring to the surface a Nazisubmarine discovered two weeks ago at the bottomof Lake Ontario. The U-boat was spotted for the first time by amateur scuba divers in late January and they had contacted the authorities. Archaeologists associated with Niagara University of and master divers from the U.S Coast Guard were mobilized on site to determine what it was, and they soon realized that they were dealing with a German submarine that sank during World War II. A wreck recovery vessel of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society was mandated to refloat the ship and bring it back to Niagara Falls, where it must be restored before becoming a museum ship. The delicate recovery operation took nearly 30 hours to complete, but the submarine was finally brought down on the bank with relative ease. The divers of the U.S. Coast guard braved the frigid water temperature to go attach cables to the wreck for the recovery operation. The submarine was identified as the UX-791, a unique experimental German submarine, based on the U-1200 model, and known to have participated in the Battle of the St. Lawrence. It was reported missing in 1943 and was believed to have been sunk near the Canadian coast Professor Mark Carpenter, who leads the team of archaeologists, believes that the U-boat could have traveled up the St-Lawrence River, all the way to the Great Lakes, where it intended to disturb the American economy. A report from the dated from February 1943 suggests, that the ship could have attacked and destroyed three cargo ships and two fishing vessels, even damaging the USS Sable (IX-81), an aircraft carrier of the U.S. navy that was used for training in the Great Lakes, before finally being sunk by anti-sub grenades launched by a Canadian frigate. We have known for a long time that the Nazis had sent some of their U-boats in the St-Lawrence River, but this is the first proof that they actually reached the Great Lakes, Professor Carpenter told reporters. This could explain the mysterious ship disappearances that took place in the region in 1943, and the reported Battle of Niagara Falls which had always been dismissed as a collective hallucination caused by fear. The restoration of the submarine could take more than two years, but once completed, the museum ship is expected to become one of the major tourist attractions of the region.",FALSE,http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/may/24/blog-posting/no-german-submarine-wasnt-just-discovered-great-la/,"Fake news, Military",

355,Hillary Clinton Furious At Special Gift Melania Trump Sent Her From Her Hospital Bed,"Americans everywhere were stunned on Monday when First Lady Melania Trump was rushed to the hospital to get kidney surgery. Now, as she remains at Walter Reed Medical Center recovering, Melania has sent Hillary Clinton a special gift that is sure to have the failed Democratic presidential candidate fuming. Right Wing News reported that Clinton has been having her liberal minions in the mainstream media regularly bash Melania in an attempt to ensure the First Lady will not be a popular one. Thats why Clinton is so livid that it has just been confirmed that her efforts to destroy Melania have backfired. Rankings released by the Social Security Administration have revealed that the name Melania came in fifth among the fastest-growing girls names from 2016 to 2017, moving 720 spots up the list. A recent poll also showed that Melanias popularity has surged by double digits since January, even among Democrats. Despite Clintons best efforts, Americans are seeing Melania as the incredibly classy First Lady that she is. This is in stark contrast to Clinton, who is one of the only First Ladies in history to see the popularity of her own name decrease after her husband took office. The popularity of the name Hillary dramatically decreased beginning in 1993, the year that Clinton became First Lady. It ended up falling a staggering 90% between 1992 and 1999. Melania showed what a class act she is once again on Wednesday when she released a statement thanking Americans everywhere for their thoughts and prayers about her surgery. A sincere thank you to Walter Reed Medical Unit @WRBethesda & to all who have send good wishes & prayers! I am feeling great & look forward to getting back home @WhiteHouse soon, Melania tweeted.

4,Tom Brokaw wants Brian Williams fired,"You know youre in trouble when Tom Brokaw is out for your blood. NBCs most revered journalist is furious that Brian Williams is still in the anchor chair after he sheepishly admitted he hadnt traveled on a helicopter hit by enemy fire. Brokaw wants Williams head on a platter, an NBC source said. He is making a lot of noise at NBC that a lesser journalist or producer would have been immediately fired or suspended for a false report. On Wednesday, Williams, 55, acknowledged that he had repeatedly said he was aboard a chopper that had been hit by a rocket-propelled grenade during a 2003 reporting trip to Iraq, when he was actually safely traveling in a different aircraft. Brokaw, 74, was still the Nightly News anchor when Williams came back from his Iraq expedition  and an insider said he knew the story Williams later spouted was bunk. Tom Brokaw and [former NBC News President] Steve Capus knew this was a false story for a long time and have been extremely uncomfortable with it, the source said. NBC News execs had counseled him to stop telling the tale. Williams still took the anchors seat for his Nightly News broadcast Thursday evening  and was working at 30 Rock all day despite calls for his dismissal. He didnt address the issue during the broadcast. He is not going to be suspended or reprimanded in any way. He has the full support of NBC News, a network source said. Many of Williams colleagues believe his claim that he simply conflated two versions of what happened in 2003. There have been meetings about it all day. They are taking it very seriously, the NBC source said. But we believe that Brians apology on the air speaks for himself. He admitted over time he conflated the events. NBC brass hasnt been talking to lower-level employees about the situation, leaving people in a panic, the insider said. NBC bosses dont understand how serious this is. Nobody in a leadership position is talking to the troops. Nobody has addressed it, the source said. One longtime NBC employee who has worked with Williams on several occasions had a few dirty words to describe the celebrated anchor, calling him a real pompous piece of st. Hes an ahole, he fumed. Hes not a journalist. Hes a reader. Oh, the fireworks that are going off inside, he said. Its embarrassing. Hes the face on NBC. Hes a liar. Everyone knew it. On Friday, Brokaw responded to reports that he wanted Williams axed. I have neither demanded nor suggested Brian be fired, Brokaw said in an email to The Huffington Post.

5,Saudi cleric issues fatwa on snowmen,"A prominent Saudi Arabian cleric has whipped up controversy by issuing a religious edict forbidding the building of snowmen, describing them as anti-Islamic. Asked on a religious website if it was permissible for fathers to build snowmen for their children after a snowstorm in the country’s north, Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Munajjid replied: “It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow, even by way of play and fun.”Quoting from Muslim scholars, Munajjid argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being, an action considered sinful under the kingdom’s strict interpretation of Sunni Islam.“God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on,” he wrote in his ruling.That provoked swift responses from Twitter users writing in Arabic and identifying themselves with Arab names. “They are afraid for their faith of everything ... sick minds,” one Twitter user wrote. Another posted a photo of a man in formal Arab garb holding the arm of a “snow bride” wearing a bra and lipstick. “The reason for the ban is fear of sedition,” he wrote. A third said the country was plagued by two types of people: “A people looking for a fatwa [religious ruling] for everything in their lives, and a cleric who wants to interfere in everything in the lives of others through a fatwa.” Munajjid had some supporters however. “It (building snowmen) is imitating the infidels, it promotes lustiness and eroticism,” one wrote. “May God preserve the scholars, for they enjoy sharp vision and recognise matters that even Satan does not think about.” Snow has covered upland areas of Tabuk province near Saudi Arabia’s border with Jordan for the third consecutive year as cold weather swept across the Middle East.",TRUE,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/12/saudi-arabia-snowmen-winter-fatwa,Culture,Emergent
6,"No, Michael Jackson Isn't Bruno Mars' Dad","Michael Jackson, legendary as he was as the King of Pop, wasn't the most the popular dad in showbiz. Ever since the Berlin baby-dangling incident of '02, the media has tirelessly and unfairly portrayed him as an irresponsible and detached father (before his death, Jackson had shown remorse for the incident). This depiction was unfortunately fueled by his own erratic behavior during the final years of his life, and the sexual abuse charges that chased Jackson a few years before his death certainly didn't help with his image. This week, social media went crazy over a ""news"" article that had been circulating Facebook and Twitter like wildfire. An article published by Empire News entitled, ""DNA Results Confirm Michael Jackson Is Biological Father Of Bruno Mars,"" has unsurprisingly shocked and enraged fans of both singers across the internet. The story went on to detail how the Billionaire singer allegedly and inadvertently revealed where he got his singing genes. The article wrote that the discovery involved Mars' firing of a certain Vladimir Kershov, the singer's reported publicist. ""Vladimir Kershov, publicist of R&B singer Bruno Mars, has been fired today after he revealed a shocking secret regarding the pop and R&B singer. Kershov leaked private information that revealed that Michael Jackson is Mars' biological father."" According to Bruno's Wikipedia page, the half-Filipino singer was born to Peter Hernandez and Bernadette Bayot in 1985 and was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii. Meanwhile, Michael was, at the time, not involved with anyone, although he was already beginning to form a relationship with future-wife Lisa Marie Presley. While Jackson was often portrayed as a bad dad in tabloids, he was, in reality, an amazing father to his kids Michael Jr, Paris and Prince. Shortly after his death, MTV revealed never-before seen correspondence with people closest to Michael, most of whom attested to the fact that the singer was a caring and loving dad to his children. Producer and Jackson's friend Teddy Reily recalled, ""Michael] read them a book every day. When we were in Virginia during the Invincible [sessions], there was not one day missed reading the children something. So that showed me right there that he was an incredible father.""

7,"Kurt Sutter Announces Plans For ‘Sons Of Anarchy’ Movie Starring Charlie Hunnam, Brad Pitt","Kurt Sutter, creator of the hit FX drama Sons of Anarchy, has announced plans to turn the popular television series into a major motion picture. Sutter, who was also a writer, producer, and director on the series, said in an interview with Hollywood Today magazine that he has long contemplated taking S.O.A. to the big screen following its run on television. “People absolutely loved the show, as did I, and I have put a lot of thought into the matter, and we are going forward with turning it into a feature film” Sutter said. Sons of Anarchy ran for seven seasons on FX, from 2008-2014, and in the process built a huge following.  Sutter said the film will star Charlie Hunnam, who played the lead character Jax Teller, as well as Ryan Hurst who played Opie Winston, and Katey Sagal as Gemma Teller. The film, which is a prequel to the storyline of Sons will also introduce fans to Jax’s father, John, who will be played by Brad Pitt. “I am most excited about bringing Brad (Pitt) on as John Teller, he is absolutely perfect for the role. The movie will take place from the day Jax was born, and leads up to the era just before Sons Of Anarchy began as a series.” Sutter also said that he is really happy to bring Ryan Hurst back as Opie Winston, and hopes fans will forgive him for killing Opie off. “Man I tell ya, when we killed Opie off, it was like the thing turned real. I’ve never gone public with this, but I’ve had people get really crazy when they see me in public,” said Sutter. “They shout at me, and they get angry – ‘You shouldn’t have killed Ope! I hope you rot in Hell!,’ that sort of thing. I had people try to run me off the road when they recognized me, although that just might be because I’m kind of a dangerous driver. Anyway, my hope is that this film will help them cope.” Sutter says pre-production on film will begin in the middle of 2015, and will begin shooting sometime in the fall. “For a movie of this scope, with this much storyline attached, you should expect to see the film by the end of 2016,” said Sutter. “In the mean time, buy all the official Sons of Anarchy merchandise you can.

Jessica Chastain is being eyed for an unspecified role. Based on Walter Isaacson’s biography “Steve Jobs,” the real-life drama is directed by Oscar-winner Danny Boyle. Scott Rudin is producing the tech drama along with Mark Gordon and Guymon Casady. Sorkin, who also penned the Facebook drama “The Social Network,” has publicly said the movie will be divided into three long scenes, each taking place backstage before one of Apple’s famous product launches. Sony acquired rights following the Apple mogul’s death in 2011. Wozniak founded Apple with Jobs and Ronald Wayne and is credited with launching the Apple I and Apple II computers in the late 1970s, which had a profound impact on the microcomputer revolution. He left Apple as a full-time employee in 1987. Last year’s independently financed “Jobs” starred Ashton Kutcher as Jobs and Josh Gad as Wozniak and covered the era from 1974 to 2001 when the iPod launched.

13,Matt Taibbi Leaves Omidyar’s First Look Media,"Matt Taibbi, the star magazine writer hired earlier this year to start a satirical website for billionaire Pierre Omidyar’s First Look Media, is on a leave of absence from the company after disagreements with higher-ups inside Omidyar’s organization, a source close to First Look confirmed today. When he was hired, amid much fanfare, Taibbi’s website was meant to be the second in an envisioned fleet of titles to be published by First Look, an ambitious digital journalism company funded by Omidyar, the founder of eBay and one of the richest tech moguls in America. Like its counterpart the Intercept, launched earlier this year by Glenn Greenwald and others to pursue investigations of NSA surveillance and the intelligence world, it was a venture centered around a brand-name polemicist without much management experience. Prior to joining First Look, Taibbi made his name by gleefully skewering fat targets for Rolling Stone — most famously, he described Goldman Sachs as “a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity” — and he said at the time of his departure that he was lured away by the chance to lampoon the financial industry in the “simultaneously funny and satirical voice” associated with the legendary magazine Spy. Over the succeeding months, the mission of the publication broadened to encompass political satire as well, and it brought on a number of high-profile names from the New York digital scene, including deputy editor Alex Pareene, formerly of Salon; Laura Dawn, a digital video producer who formerly worked with Moveon.org; and Edith Zimmerman, editor of the Hairpin.“Journalists should be dark, funny, mean people,” Taibbi told New York in an interview in March. “It’s appropriate for their antagonistic, adversarial role.” Omidyar originally conceived of First Look as a network of interlinking sites run by “independent” journalists, many of whom took a similarly adversarial approach to journalism. Over the last year, however, the center of gravity of the organization has shifted, as Omidyar and his Silicon Valley braintrust have exerted control over budgets and vacillated over the journalistic mission. Over the summer, Omidyar appointed a longtime confidante, John Temple — a former newspaper editor who previously led an Omidyar-financed civic journalism venture in Hawaii — to be the president for audience and products, putting him in a position above Eric Bates, the former Rolling Stone editor who was brought on as a First Look editorial director, who is close to Taibbi. The confrontational approach that made Taibbi’s name at Rolling Stone — and before that, as a co-founder of the gonzo Moscow expatriate magazine The eXile — appears to have contributed to internal trouble at First Look. Sources confirmed that Taibbi has been absent from the office for several weeks, only returning on one brief occasion to address the staff. Although those hired have been reassured that the project would continue on during the unspecified term of Taibbi’s absence, the launch date for Racket — which Taibbi indicated in September would be coming “in a month” — now appears to have been pushed off. “We have a target date but I wouldn’t make a launch date public,” said Temple, who is based in San Francisco, when reached by phone this morning. “I don’t comment about internal matters and I don’t comment on personnel matters. …  I mean we’re a private company, so why would we … no.” Taibbi’s absence is only the latest in a series of shifts inside First Look, which Omidyar founded last year, originally in response to the disclosures of NSA surveillance leaked by Edward Snowden to Greenwald and his Intercept colleague Laura Poitras. Omidyar initially committed $250 million to the project and began laying plans for a large general interest website and a number of more narrowly focused “digital magazines.” In July, the billionaire announced he was scaling back the plan for the time being, choosing instead to focus on Racket and the Intercept as prototypes for a new technological model of journalism. The Intercept has lately been publishing vigorously, breaking several major stories — federal investigators are reportedly pursuing the alleged leaker responsible for a story on the site about the government’s voluminous terrorist watch list. But Racket has been much slower to materialize, leading to rumors of staff anxiety. In August, Temple told me Taibbi’s site was experimenting with a variety of journalistic approaches — not just satire and humor but also investigative journalism. For instance, Ellen Miller, head of the campaign finance watchdog the Sunlight Foundation — a nonprofit also heavily financed by Omidyar — met with the staff over the summer to discuss how it might dig into issues of money in politics. “We’re supporting Matt in creating something unique — and it’s Matt’s,” Temple told me. “He’s building a team and there’s great esprit in Matt’s team.” Taibbi’s clashes with those at the top are likely to drive further speculation about the fate of the long-incubating project and about the journalist’s own continued involvement. Nonetheless, the site is apparently still hiring.",TRUE,http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/10/matt-taibbi-disappears-from-omidyars-first-look.html,Culture,Emergent
14,On ESPN and Domestic Violence,"Statement from John Wildhack, ESPN EVP, Programming and Production
Contrary to published reports in Esquire, there was no panel on domestic violence ever planned for tonight's Monday Night Countdown. We will present our normal Monday Night Football pre-game show, with Suzy Kolber hosting. ESPN is proud of the work it has done covering the issue of domestic violence, and is committed to continued coverage. Much of that work has been informed by several talented female colleagues from our television and espnW platforms, including Hannah Storm, Jemele Hill, Jane McManus, Kate Fagan, Sarah Spain and more.

Here is a rundown of tonight's show.

[/pullquote]

On Monday night, during Monday Night Football's two-hour pregame show, I thought it likely that the regular commentators were going to discuss domestic abuse in the NFL. Last week, seven men, but no women, discussed Ray Rice's punishment in the opening block of Monday Night Countdown. Victims of domestic violence in America are most likely to be women aged 20-24.

When the show has updates from the field—brief reports about injuries and the upcoming game—they'll cut to female sideline reporters, Lisa Salters and, on some weeks, Suzy Kolber.

These people are not allowed at the table.

On Monday, you will hear the voices of 11 men tripping over themselves to condemn the actions of one man who knocked his wife unconscious and dragged her motionless body into a casino lobby, and another man who head-butted his wife because she would not have sex with him.

You will hear their beliefs on the commissioner who did not punish Ray Rice appropriately and whose investigation into Rice's domestic violence incident is currently unclear, and might have been intentionally obfuscated or covered up.

But you will not hear these words: ""Roger Goodell is a liar.""

You will not hear these words because ESPN has a $15.2 billion broadcasting agreement with the NFL. You will not hear these words because it would interfere with the amount of money both ESPN and the NFL can make.

You will not hear these words because ESPN has intimidated its on-air staff into standing down against domestic violence.

Last week, ESPN suspended one of its editors, Bill Simmons, for calling NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell ""a liar"" and daring his bosses to suspend him for it. They suspended him for it.

Long-tenured editors and personalities of ESPN: It is now time for you to walk out with him.

This is the kind of moment that separates a ""journalist"" from a ""commentator."" What do you want to be?

Simmons' suspension at ESPN will last three weeks—one week longer than Ray Rice's initial suspension by Goodell himself. Ray Rice punched his fiancée in the face, knocking her unconscious. Bill Simmons called the head of a corporate interest a liar. His suspension is one of the longest in the history of his company.

Simmons' ascendence is credited to his willingness to say sentences exactly like this. By refusing to wait in line or repeat pabulum and talking points all the way to a potential columnist job later in life, he gained an audience. The network hired Simmons to absorb his growing readership into its offshoot Page 2 section, developing a major success in spite of itself.

Simmons disabused the language of testosterone-soaked talking heads, and it worked. He avoided the intentionally adversarial outrage only created for TV ratings purposes, like the collection of recent controversies by Stephen A. Smith.

Before the second, damning tape in the Ray Rice incident became available, Smith initially attempted to deflect the blame of Ray Rice's domestic incident onto Rice's fiancée, Janay.

""What I've tried to employ the female members of my family — some of who you all met and talked to and what have you—is that: Let's make sure we don't do anything to provoke wrong actions. Because if I come—or somebody else come, whether it's law enforcement officials, your brother or the fellas that you know—if we come after somebody (who) has put their hands on you, it doesn't negate the fact that they already put their hands on you.""

[/pullquote]

Smith had seen Ray Rice dragging a lifeless body out of an elevator and assumed the victim was somehow asking for it.

He was suspended for one week for those comments. Bill Simmons was suspended for three weeks.

Not even six weeks after returning from his suspension, Smith was back on First Take, an ESPN morning debate show, having a partial statement read to him from the National Organization for Women about Roger Goodell and Ray Rice. In the statement, NOW President Terry O'Neill implored Goodell to resign. Exactly 39 seconds after hearing her words for the first time in his life, Smith said that the President for the National Organization for Women had ""lost her mind.""

[pullquote align='C']

""I'm sorry, I think this woman is off her rocker. I think she's lost her mind. That's right, I said it. This is the most ridiculous nonsense I've ever heard in my life. Roger Goodell deserves to lose his job?"" he said. ""That's crazy. That's crazy.""

[/pullquote]

It was a temper tantrum. Smith was not suspended. Simmons was suspended for three weeks. ESPN has no affiliation with the National Organization for Women. ESPN has a broadcasting agreement with the NFL until 2021.

Still, this week, ESPN's ombudsman Robert Lipsyte called this ""ESPN's finest hour during my tenure.""

Last night, Lipsyte defended Simmons' suspension with this sentence: ""Bill Simmons has no license to call him (a liar) without more justification than 'I'm just saying it.'""

Six weeks ago, this is how Stephen A. Smith defended advocating for the discussion of ""the elements of provocation"" that could lead to a man hitting a woman: ""I don't think that's broached enough, is all I'm saying.""

Bill Simmons was suspended for three weeks. Stephen A. Smith was suspended for one.

In the old boys club of sports media—one with no room for reflection and one that empowers only those who can speak about a base emotion in the fastest and loudest way—Simmons succeeded by writing differently. When his contract expired, Simmons was convinced to stay after ESPN promised him his own outlet, Grantland. The site has since produced thoughtful pieces from different voices—not just retired, bravado-filled athletes or 50-something male anchors who have paid their corporate dues, but also writers who would rather drill deep into statistics, experiment with art and new media, or write contemplatively, creatively and passionately, sometimes under pseudonyms.

Grantland finally allowed for the journalism and opinions of, basically, anyone else.

When female contributors write features for Grantland, they are equal—another voice amidst other smart ideas. Women at Grantland are not cast aside to a separate, less-visited section of their website. That's precisely what happens at ESPN proper, the home of ESPNW—a well-intentioned, largely ignored property at the bottom of ESPN.com, called upon only when ""women's issues"" affect sports.

This is the kind of tokenism that affected FoxSports.com's Katie Nolan. In August, before the elevator footage of Ray Rice's domestic abuse incident was released, Nolan had the chance to ask Roger Goodell about why he didn't suspend Rice for more games, based on the first video. She didn't. ""I'm really going to hear about it from my bosses,"" she said. ""It's really not my role,"" she said. ""I played the role that had been assigned to me,"" she said.

A month later, she understood this to be a part of a culture of quiet repression. ""Women in sports television are allowed to read headlines, patrol sidelines and generally facilitate conversation for their male colleagues,"" she said. ""Sometimes they even let us monitor the Internet from a couch.""

She said all of this in a video on FoxSports.com. She ended it with, ""I'm ready when you are, Fox.""

She was not suspended. She was applauded on the company's website.

And that is the problem with ESPN and the old-wave of sports media: Sports are not now being infiltrated by ""women's issues"" that demand one-off responses. Women are half the population of the world—and sports are a part of that world.

There are 11 seats at the table at ESPN. All of them go to men. Women get their own table, but only sometimes—and ESPN has placed that table where no one can hear them.

ESPN personalities—even those 11 men—have spent the last two weeks on television defending their position atop a moral high-ground. Each retired player and 60-year-old man has had his chance to spout tough talk about how he would never personally commit or condone domestic violence.

Now that their company is standing behind—as ESPN anchor Keith Olbermann put it—""an enabler of men who beat women"" instead of an employee, where have these personalities gone?

They are silent.

Long-tenured editors and personalities of ESPN: Those condemnations mean nothing if you don't stand up for your ideals, your integrity, and the rights of women when your paycheck is on the line.

It means you, too, are just like your bosses: When faced with reporting the truth or collecting a paycheck—even at the most critical moment of your journalistic career—you will take the paycheck.

It means every word spoken about morality from now on is simply just posturing to protect your public image.

It means you are not a journalist. It means you are a commentator, for now and forever.

So stand up. You'd stand for the defining issues of the moment: Corporate entanglement, equal rights, the idea of journalism, and your own integrity.

You would be vindicated in the eyes of history during this very tiresome moment. You would be standing for the truth.",FALSE,https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a30180/espn-has-a-women-problem/,Culture,Emergent
15,Has The Batman Vs. Superman Batmobile Been Stolen In Detroit?,"The scuttlebutt from sources in Detroit is that one of the Batmobile models being used in the filming of Batman Vs. Superman has gone missing, believed stolen. It would not be the first time a Batmobile has been nicked in Detroit. Though that was just a $200 replica of the TV Series version back in 2o10. Anyway, if you are driving around and get overtaken by this……do get in touch. Warner Bros representatives did not respond to inquiries.",FALSE,https://bleedingcool.com/movies/has-the-batman-vs-superman-batmobile-been-stolen-in-detroit/,Culture,Emergent
16,,"It wasnt very long ago that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman was treating talk of expansion as though he was being asked if hed like an epidemic of Ebola. But recently the nature of the rhetoric has changed so much that the question is becoming not if, but when. And then the ultimate question. Will they be able to limit the number of new teams to just two? Sources close to the situation have indicated Las Vegas is a done deal, the only thing to be determined being which owner will be entitled to proclaim that he brought the first major league sports franchise to Sin City. And given how dead set against a team in the gambling haven the commissioner was 10 years ago, this move into another player friendly state-tax-free zone represents a considerable about-face indeed. But people have been betting on hockey games for years and to pretend games couldnt be fixed just as easily anywhere as in Vegas is pretty ridiculous, so that posturing has fallen by the wayside. A new team close to the newly renamed Arizona squad and Californias big three is all but assured, the only question being when and with which other city. Or should that be plural? With all the activity going on in the Seattle area in the last little bit it would be quite a stretch to imagine that much time and effort being spent by so many wealthy men being frittered away for nothing. At the moment there are no surefire plans to build a new rink, but that could change at any time with Vancouver billionaire Victor Coleman among many reportedly showing interest in putting an NHL team into the city. And Bettman hasnt been visiting there to see if it really does rain a lot. Its been 15 years since the NHL expanded  and given there are 16 teams in the east and just 14 in the west, taking in two more teams would certainly seem to make a lot of sense, the same amount of sense it made when realignment was first announced. And expanding without the players getting their mitts on any of the money other than the increase in payrolls is surely tempting, at least to those owners who remember the hefty cheques they cashed for Columbus and Minnesota. Whereas before the commissioner balked at expansion, this is a sample of his more recent verbal footwork: Theres a lot of interest. Were hearing from multiple groups in Seattle and in Vegas and Kansas City and Quebec City, Bettman said to the Tribune while scoping out Target field in Minny for yet another trip to the well of outdoor games. We have not decided to engage in a formal expansion process but we listen to expressions of interest. Its not something weve seriously considered yet. Like hell it isnt. Theyd have to be nuts not to be thinking about it seriously. And since then things have changed for a commissioner who hates to move teams in his league no matter how dire the circumstances might appear  one of the most likable aspects of his regime for most hockey fans. Once the league comes to your area, it is going to stay through thick, thin and the almost impossible, as seems to be the case in Phoenix. But could that long-standing policy and loyalty change with the Florida situation? True theres a lease until 2028, but with the Panthers bleeding money, even the city of Sunrise cant seem to see the point of carrying on much longer, so perhaps one of these new cities could get an existing team after all. And while Kansas City isnt really likely to be a serious contender in this expansion soup unless theyre going to stretch it to four teams, saying no to Quebec City in favour of two more U.S. cities with no proven NHL backgrounds is almost certainly not going to happen. Going back to Minnesota has been a success, and theres no question theres more money and corporate backing than ever before in Quebec. Even an expansion team there in a new arena would be virtually assured of sellouts into perpetuity. There will be all manner of bleating about there being insufficient talent, of course, but even if its true, after such a long wait this trivial detail  which only troubles the fans  isnt going to get in the way of a financial windfall like this. And any time the league decides it could use talent, they can start doing away with most of the coaches they employ whose chief calling in life is to devise ways to stop offensive players and choke the very life out of the game thats paying their salaries. Expansion will be happening, and soon. The only question is how many new cities will be involved.
